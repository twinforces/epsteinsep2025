The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result\nin a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance\nfrom, the Allegations in the Indictment\n\nDuring jury deliberations, the jury sent the follouing jury note\nregarding Count Four of the Indictment:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the\ntransportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to\nNew Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second\nelement?*\n\nThe District Court determined that it would not respond to the note\ndirectly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and\ninstead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.*6\n%4 Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 5o rather than allouing the parties to\ndo so.

To allege a variance, a defendant “must\nestablish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the\nevidence alleged in the indictment.” To prevail and win reversal, the\ndefendant must further shou “that substantial prejudice occurred at\ntrial as a result” of the variance.“ “A defendant cannot demonstrate\nthat he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character\nthat could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the\nvariance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” ”\n\nFor reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the\nconstructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts\n4 A-387; see United States v.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v.

Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001337.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001339.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page22 of 25\nMaxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for temporary\nrelease in her third bail motion.’\n\n39.

This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001456.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. l, 6 (l95l) (explaining,\nbefore passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper procedure for challenging\nbail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of\nAppeals from an order denying such motion”). The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\ndetermination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail determination is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless.

The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for\ncompelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling\nlaw, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.” Jd. at l23-24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 2l3 F.3d 34,\n39 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy\nabsent cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,\nlet alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23, for this Court to reverse its\nprior decision.\n\n33. The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her\nrequest that this Court reverse itself is additional leter briefing before the District\nCourt regarding MDC’s nightime security checks. Nothing about that briefing or\nJudge Nathan’s most recent writen order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred\nwhen finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when determining\nthat temporary release is not warranted.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001460.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001462.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when denying Maxwell temporary release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government\ndoes not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section\n3l42(g)(4).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to grant bail to Ms.\nMaxwell, on the strict conditions proposed belou (or as modified by the Court), for two\ncompelling reasons.\n\nFirst, the COVID-l9 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As\nthis Court has noted, the COVID-l9 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to\nincarcerated individuals, and COVID-l9-related restrictions on atorney communications with\npretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,\nunder these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious\nrisk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).\n\nSecond, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under\nthe Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government\nmay be rebuted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.\ncitizen and has lived in this country for almost 3o years; she ran a non-profit company based in\nthe United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it doun to\nprotect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with\nfamily members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the protective order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 2 of 5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nindictment alleges 25-year-old conduct that supposedly occurred on unspecified dates in multiple\nlocations on different continents, and involves numerous alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein.\nMoreover, the government’s position is based on the claimed privacy rights of the alleged\nvictims, nou all adults, who may well have sued Mr. Epstein and/or Ms. Maxwell in public civil\nactions or otherwise identified themselves by name in public fora. As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient. (Gov’t Resp. at 2 n.2). Such partial information only helps confirm the identity of\nDOJ-OGR-ooool725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\nrape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\nincorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\nrecognized that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in ordering the disclosure of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nin stark contrast to the 25-year-old conduct alleged in this case. Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at\n*|-2. The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), a Court may enter a protective order\nonly after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\nprotective order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.\nSee Dkt. No. 35 at l (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating\nto the proposed protective order.”). The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a\nprovision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt. No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o protective order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 9 l(a), lo(a), l4(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery.\n\nUpon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which\nseeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal\n? Tn the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.” In re Teligent,\nInc., 64o F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation omited). Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for\nmodification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context. See, e.g., United States v. Calderon,\nNo. 3:l5-CR-25 (JCH), 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (applying the civil standard for the\nmodification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. o7-CR-lo27 (LAP), 2ol4 WL\nl27lo346 at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2ol4) (same). See also United States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 723 (Sth Cir.\n2ol5) (applying the standard for “good cause” in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective\norder entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll Grd Cir. 2oo7) (same).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool748\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The\ncriminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001921.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 44 of 9l 44\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl confidentiality, as your Honor pointed out.

Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries.

The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> available in such\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in\nfavor of extradition”.\n\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a bill\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a Bill of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to investigate these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A bill of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with\nsufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574\n(2d Cir. l987). The decision of whether to grant a bill of particulars is within the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\nthe district court. /d. “In deciding whether a bill of particulars is needed, the court must\ndetermine whether the information sought has been provided elsewhere, such as in other items\nprovided by discovery, responses made to requests for particulars, prior proceedings, and the\nindictment itself.” United States v. Strawberry, 892 F. Supp. 5l9, 526 (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not\nknouing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not knou who\nhas accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here. See\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975);° United States v. Warme, No.\nO9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose\nidentity of sex crime victim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against\nthis charge is significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim’). On August 25, 2o2o, the Court denied as premature our request that the government be\nordered to provide the identities of the three accusers. (Dkt. 49). We have conferred with the\n>In Cannone, the Second Circuit reversed for abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> the district court’s order to compel disclosure of\nwitness identities under the circumstances of that case. 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2.

Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974). The circumstances of this case — the age of the offenses, the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 23\nCourt may order the disclosure when a balancing of the defendant’s need for disclosure and the\ngovernment's need for concealment indicates that such an order would be in the interests of\nJustice. See Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Trial courts generally exercise <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to order\nsuch disclosure upon a finding that a defendant’s request is material to the preparation of the case\nand is otherwise reasonable. See id. at 3oo-ol. Courts assess the materiality and reasonableness\nof the request through the application of a six-factor test set forth in United States v. Turkish, 458\nF. Supp. 874 (S.D.N.Y. l978):\n\nl. Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence?\n\n2. Have the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence?\n\n3. Will the evidence in the case largely consist of testimony relating to documents\n\n(which by their nature are not easily altered)?\n\n4. Is there a realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will\nincrease the likelihood that the prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or\nwill be unwilling to testify at trial?\n\n5. Does the indictment allege offenses occurring over an extended period of time,\nmaking preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?\n\n6. Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their\ndefense?\n\nId. at 88l.\n\nHere, the application of the Turkish factors favors early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses. The indictment does not allege crimes of violence, Ms. Maxwell has no\ncriminal history, and the government has conceded that she is not a danger to the community.\nThe age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed by a global pandemic makes\ninvestigation and preparation of this case complex and difficult. Disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list is material to the preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 9 of l2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”!

[w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty\nas to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her\nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations.

The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\nAmendment, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the protective order to permit compliance with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s application under Martindell, properly exercised her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nin modifying the protective order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) protective order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 239\nway circumvented Martindell; rather, the Government sought court approval to enforce a subpoena\nand then folloued the directives it received.*”\n\nMost critically, houever, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell,\nMaxwell offers no legal authority for the proposition that suppression is the proper remedy.*®\nIndeed, none of the Second Circuit cases applying Martindell contemplate suppression as a\nremedy. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional circumstances or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of protective orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in modifying the protective order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\nprotective order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\napplication and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a protective order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s invitation to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\nprotective order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a protective order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other\nindividuals’ depositions, who were not parties to the protective order.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 239\n\nThe defendant asks the Court for a drastic remedy, namely suppression of a// evidence the\nGovernment obtained pursuant to the subpoena, as well as the dismissal of Counts Five and Six.\nIn so doing, the defendant seeks a windfall to which she is not entitled based on unprecedented\nclaims that ignore the facts and the law. Suppression of all materials the Government obtained\npursuant to the subpoena is unwarranted here, particularly where certain of the materials have been\nsubsequently unsealed by Judge Preska in the underlying civil litigation, including Maxwell’s\nApril 2ol6 deposition transcript. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). The Second Circuit\naffirmed Judge Preska’s ruling in October 2o2o, finding that the Court “correctly held that the\ndeposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access ataches,\nand did not abuse its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests\nsuperseded the presumption of access.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-\nl at 3).” On October 22, 2o2o, the defendant’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5\nCiv. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3). In February 2o2l, a redacted version of the defendant’s July\n2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l). In other words,\nhad the Government not obtained an order modifying the protective order, the Government\ninevitably would have discovered and obtained, at a minimum, the defendant’s April 2ol6\ndeposition transcript and a portion of the July 2ol6 transcript that form the basis of the charges in\nCounts Five and Six.\n* Relatedly, the defendant moved to modify the criminal protective order in order to use\nconfidential criminal discovery materials in filings she intended to submit in civil litigation. The\ndefendant raised this precise point—that if the Court ultimately decided that it was inappropriate\nfor the Government to proceed by subpoena, the Government would claim inevitable discovery.\n(Dkt. No. 54 at 3). The defendant offered no coherent explanation of hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no\ncase law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery argument by the\nGovernment should foreclose unsealing in a civil case. This Court rejected the defendant’s motion\nto modify the criminal protective order. (Dkt. No. 5l). The Second Circuit also dismissed the\ndefendant’s appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 7l).\n\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003101.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 239\nin a bankruptcy proceeding).

Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

Houever, the\nGovernment has provided such information, and much more, in the Indictment, extensive\ndiscovery, and various pretrial filings, including this memorandum.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated.\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!\"°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy).

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls.

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span>\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo333o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.

Department policy gave him the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”** Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7®°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record.

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

We\nwill defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla.

Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family\nof the victim must be consulted by the state atorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the\ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*44 The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”*4” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\naH In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (Sth Cir. 2oo8). The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida,\nwhich is within the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n345 United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2oo8 WL 5ol32l, at *ll (S.D.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”>°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*”°\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">DISCRETION</span> WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v.

Among the multitude of\nrationales for the rule, rarely, if ever, will a lawyer be able to effectively serve as an advocate\nand give testimony:\n\nA lawyer who intermingles the functions of advocate and witness diminishes his\n\neffectiveness in both roles. The client's case is subject to the criticism that it is\n\nbeing presented through the testimony of an obviously interested witness who on\n\nthat account is subject to impeachment, and, of equal importance, the lawyer is\n\nplaced in the unseemly position of arguing his oun credibility to the jury.\nWilliams v. Dist. Ct., El Paso Cty., 7oo P.2d 549, 553 (Colo. l985).°\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell (“Colorado Counsel”) have direct, relevant, testimony\napplicable to the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations in Counts Five and Six, the\nquestions, the objections, and the lack of materiality of these questions. Testimony from\nColorado Counsel would likely include their knouledge about the many false statements made\nby Giuffre and the actions of her lawyers including discovery abuses. But operating in a dual\ncapacity, lawyer and witness, would create confusion, subject Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers to cross-\nexamination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, courts in this\nCircuit do not allou atorneys to function in this dual role, even if the defendant is willing. See\nUnited States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d lo64, lo74 (2d Cir. l982) (disqualification of trial\ncounsel “required” as a result of “their participation in the events underlying” one of the\ncharges); United States v.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial.

Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy. Guzman's\nconviction on the conspiracy count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the conspiracy was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

The conspiracy\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7o of 349\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

If you\nwant to work major cases in the district you must understand and\naccept the fact that there is a chain of command — something you\ndisregard with great regularity.\n\nVillafafia acknouledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to\ndeviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable\noffense. She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She percetved that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 72 of 349\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.””, Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 93 of 349\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 94 of 349\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lol of 349\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l34 of 349\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly.

Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5o of 349\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span>\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l62 of 349\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l66 of 349\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23o of 349\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.””* Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 233 of 349\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of .. .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy.

I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)(a) (2oo7). Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or writen impact statement.\nFla. Stat. § 96o.ool(l)ck) (2oo7). Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family\nof the victim must be consulted by the state atorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the\ndisposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 256 of 349\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*4+ The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”*4” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\naH In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (5th Cir. 2oo8). The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida,\nwhich is within the Eleventh Circuit.\n\n345 United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2oo8 WL 5ol32l, at *ll (S.D.

Victims who\nwished to be heard were permited to speak at the plea hearing.\nS86 Dean, 527 F.3d at 394.\n\n347 Before Epstein’s state court plea hearing, Edwards also began representing the victim who became Jane Doe\n#2.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victms who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 272 of 349\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 279 of 349\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’?

In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">DISCRETION</span> WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 296 of 349\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3oo of 349\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 44 of 8o\nuse of the same with the [prior bad acts] witnesses, were essential to resolving the\notherwise he-said-she-said nature of [Constand’s] allegations.” /d. The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, Cosby’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes Cosby's knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up). The court added that any potential for unfair prejudice was\nmitigated substantially by the court’s cautionary instructions, and that, accordingly, there\nwas no error in the admission of this evidence. /d. at 42l.\n\nTurning to Cosby’s claims relating to the enforceability of the non-prosecution or\nimmunity decision rendered by then-District Atorney Castor, the Superior Court viewed\nthis as a challenge to the denial of a motion to quash a criminal complaint, which would\nbe evaluated under an abuse-of-<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> standard. /d. at 4lo. Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62). Therefore, the court opined, “it is clear on the face of the record that the\ntrial court did not abuse its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining that there was no enforceable non-\nprosecution agreement in this case.” /d. The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to prosecute [Cosby], only a court order can convey such immunity. Such\npromises exist only as exercises of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, and may be revoked at any\ntime.” /d. The court discussed the immunity statute and observed that it provides that “a\ndistrict atorney may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 54 of 8o\n\nto prosecute a case”); Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to file criminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\nClancy, l92 A.3d at 53 (cleaned up).\n\nAs prosecutors are vested with such “tremendous” <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and authority, our\nlaw has long recognized the special weight that must be accorded to their assurances.\nFor instance, in the context of statements made during guilty plea negotiations, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has held that, as a mater of constitutional due\nprocess and as compelled by the principle of fundamental fairness, a defendant generally\nis entitled to the benefit of assurances made by the prosecutor. See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43. The prosecutor also agreed to consent to a\nrequest that Zuber’s sentence be served concurrently with “back time” that Zuber was\nrequired to serve for a parole violation. /d. at443. The prosecutor stated the terms of the\nagreement on the record, and the trial court accepted the terms of Zuber’s guilty plea and\nol In Santobello, the Supreme Court of the United States did not state explicitly that\nit was premising its holding on due process guarantees. Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a constitutional basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater. See Santobello, 4o4\nU.S., at 266-67 (Douglas, J. concurring).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 59 of 8o\n\nThere is no doubt that promises made during plea negotiations or as part of fully\nconsummated plea agreements differ in kind from the unilateral <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> exercised when\na prosecutor declines to pursue criminal charges against a defendant. As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53.

See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process. See\nCommonwealth v. Sims, 9l9 A.2d 93l, 94l n.6 (Pa. 2oo7) (noting that federal and state\ndue process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively). We have\nexplained that review of a due process claim “entails an assessment as to whether the\nchallenged proceeding or conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” Commonwealth v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 62 of 8o\n\nThat is what happened in this case. There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\nprosecute Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to prosecute was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to prosecute, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in circumstances where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 79 of 8o\nconstitutional right, was compelled to participate in a civil case after losing that right,\ntestified against his oun interests, weakened his position there and ultimately setled the\ncase for a large sum of money, was tried twice in criminal court, was convicted, and has\nserved several years in prison. All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295.

The decision to charge,\nor not to charge, a defendant can be conditioned, modified, or revoked at the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nof the prosecutor.\n\nHouever, the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> vested in our Commonwealth’s prosecutors, houever\nvast, does not mean that its exercise is free of the constraints of due process. When an\nunconditional charging decision is made publicly and with the intent to induce action and\nreliance by the defendant, and when the defendant does so to his detriment (and in some\ninstances upon the advice of counsel), denying the defendant the benefit of that decision\nis an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution\nthat was foregone for more than a decade. No mere changing of the guard strips that\ncircumstance of its inequity. See, e.g., State v. Myers, 5l3 S.E.2d 676, 682 n.l (W.Va.\nl998) (explaining that “any change in the duly elected prosecutor does not affect the\nstandard of responsibility for the office”). A contrary result would be patently untenable.\nIt would violate long-cherished principles of fundamental fairness. It would be antithetical\nto, and corrosive of, the integrity and functionality of the criminal justice system that we\nstrive to maintain.\n\nFor these reasons, Cosby’s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated,\nand he is discharged.*°\n\nJustices Todd, Donohue and Mundy join the opinion.\n\nJustice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which\nChief Justice Baer joins.\n\nJustice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.\na5 Accordingly, we do not address Cosby’s other issue.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 27 |\n.

TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel.

Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod.

The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order.

THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R. Kelly case”); United States v. Elizabeth\nHolmes, l8 Cr. 258 (EJD) (NDCA) (“Theranos case”); United States v. Keith Rainier, l8 Cr. 2o4\n(NGG) (EDNY) (“Nexium case”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page5ofl7\nIndividual voir dire is appropriate and within the court’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in cases like this\nwhere the potential jury pool has been exposed to extensive pretrial publicity and may harbor\nprejudice against the defendant, and where the allegations touch on issues that are potentially\ninflammatory. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3; see also United States v. Rahman,l89 F.3d 88, l22\n(2d Cir. l999). Using individual voir dire, in addition to a juror questionnaire, is necessary in\nthis case (l) to expose potential biases by maximizing the likelihood that members of the venire\nwill respond honestly to questions, and (i) to avoid contaminating unbiased members of the\nvenire when other members disclose prior knouledge of prejudicial information or blurt out a\nprejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:\nIt may sometimes be necessary to question on voir dire prospective\njurors individually or in small groups, both to maximize the\nlikelihood that members of the venire will respond honestly to\nquestions conceming bias, and to avoid contaminating unbiased\nmembers of the venire when other members disclose prior\nknouledge of prejudicial information.\nNebraska Press Ass’n v.

A Tsunami of Pretrial Publicity About this Case\nCountless articles, books, podcasts, television shous, and docuseries from various\n\nsources have been published and broadcast concerning this case since it was filed in July 2o2o.\nThis folloued closely on the heels of an avalanche of media reports preceding and follouing\n\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 and follouing his death in August 2ol9. A tsunami of reporting in\nevery conceivable form — newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio, video streaming\n\nservices, podcasts, social media platforms — has broadcast this case locally, nationally, and\n\nglobally.

There are literally hundreds if not thousands\nof negative articles about Ms. Maxwell and Epstein in the very newspapers, television stations,\nand streaming platforms to which the jury pool in this case are regularly exposed (New York\nDaily News, New York Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NY l, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox,\nNetflix, Peacock).\n\nThe jury pool from which the jury in this case will be selected has been exposed to more\nthan its fair share of media coverage fomenting public outrage at individuals accused of sex\ncrimes, like Ms. Maxwell. The negative publicity has been so pervasive, vitriolic, and extreme\nthat Ms. Maxwell has been demonized in the press.

A ROBUST JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND INDIVIDUAL VOIR DIRE ARE\n\nNECESSARY FOR THIS CASE\n\nA. A Questionnaire Alone Is Insufficient to Uncover Potential Juror Bias\n\nIn cases like this—where there has been pervasive media exposure that inflames passions\nabout the underlying events and demonizes a party—prospective jurors can form biases long\nbefore they appear for jury service. Once a pretrial judgment is made, the concepts of “belief\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel2ofl7\ncounsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the necessary information upon which to base such\nstrikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L.

Atorney Voir Dire Is Not Warranted\n\nNone of the defendant’s arguments warrant departing from the well-setled practice in this\nDistrict of Court-led voir dire. The Court is well-equipped to thoroughly question prospective\njurors and to appropriately filter questions prepared by the parties.\n\nIt is well established that “[a] district court is ‘accorded ample <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining\nhou best to conduct .. . voir dire.’” United States v.

As a general mater, “[v]Joir dire is necessarily a\nmater in which the trial court has extremely broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>,” and “federal trial judges are not\nrequired to ask every question that counsel—even all counsel—believes is appropriate.” Lawes,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo525o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 355 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Page2of5\nPage 2\n\n292 F.3d at l28; see also United States v.

See, e.g., Lawes, 292 F.3d at\nl28 (noting the “long struggle between bench and bar” over juror questioning and observing that\n“federal courts have successfully resisted such atempts” by counsel to have a greater role). Courts\nare generally resistant to such efforts because “[c]ourt and counsel have somewhat different goals\nin voir dire.” Jd. As the Second Circuit has observed:\n\nThe court wants a fair and impartial jury to be chosen and to move\n\nexpeditiously to the presentation of evidence. Counsel want a jury\n\nfavorable to their cause—fair or not—and voir dire aids them in\n\nexercising peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.\n\nCounsel have an additional purpose in voir dire moreover and that\n\ninvolves exposing jurors to various arguments they intend to make\n\nat trial. Counsel view voir dire as an opportunity for advocacy\n\nsimilar to, albeit not the equivalent of, openings or summations.\nId.; see also United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThere is nothing surprising about the government’s opposition to limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire and individual sequestered voir dire. (Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Purcell, 967 F.3d l59, l96 (2d Cir.\n2o2o). The Second Circuit has relied on subsection (i) of the amended Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\nfinding that the district court did not abuse its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in admiting prior consistent statements\nthat were introduced to rebut ‘defendants’ atacks on [the declarant’s] credibility and memory,”\nnotwithstanding that the defendants’ “challenges to [the declarant’s] memory were brief and\nwere not their main challenges.” United States v.

For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of54\nvalue of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the Government\nand risk of distracting the jury or encouraging jury nullification. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o3.\nThe Court should therefore preclude evidence or argument regarding the Government’s supposed\nmotives for prosecution, including evidence of Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of\ncharges against the defendant.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that claims of purported government misconduct must\nbe “directed to the court rather than jury.” United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir.\nl997). Allegations concerning the government’s conduct are “ultimately separate from the issue\nof [a defendant’s] factual guilt” and concern an alleged “defect in the institution of the\nprosecution.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, district courts routinely and\ncorrectly preclude defendants from raising these arguments at trial. See id. (“[W]e agree with the\ndistrict court’s decision to resolve for itself whether the government’s conduct was lawful and to\nprevent Regan from presenting evidence on that subject.”); United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr.\n7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

In general, “the decision\nas to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the prosecutor, and a\nprosecutor’s pretrial charging decision is presumed legitimate.” United States v. Sanders, 2ll\nF.3d 7ll, 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (citations and internal quotation marks omited); see United States\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 54\n\nv. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 463 (l996) (“[S]lo long as the prosecutor has probable cause to\nbelieve that the accused commited an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to\nprosecute . . . generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” (internal quotation marks\nomited)). Defendants are permited to challenge the motives for a prosecution by seeking\ndismissal of an indictment due to vindictive or selective prosecution. See, e.g., United States v.\nAvenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 558, 562-64, 576 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2o2o) (denying vindictive\nand selective prosecution claims). Such challenges, houever, are issues “for the court rather\nthan for the jury.” United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Regan,\nlo3 F.3d at lo82); see Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b)(3)(A)(iv) (listing, among pretrial motions, “a\ndefect in instituting the prosecution, including . . . selective or vindictive prosecution’’).\nAccordingly, courts have sustained objections or precluded defendants from arguing to the jury\nabout the Government’s motives. See Farhane, 634 F.3d. at l66-67 (affirming a sustained\nobjection to a defense closing argument that “the government had targeted him for prosecution\nbased on his religion”); United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at\n*3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (“[T]o the extent Locust seeks to highlight the fact that he was not a\ntarget of the investigation to suggest that the government’s true targets were the doctors and\nlawyers allegedly involved in the conspiracy and to draw atention to their absence from this\ncase, the Court has already ruled that such argument is improper.”).\n\nThe defense is free to argue that the defendant is not guilty. Houever, offering evidence\nor argument to claim the Government is prosecuting the defendant because Epstein is dead, as a\nscapegoat for Epstein, or for any other improper motive, is impermissible—and untrue.

As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited).

Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page8ofl2\nIV.

United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl2\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant had acted willfully and in bad faith in not disclosing\nthe witness until the second day of trial after the prosecution's primary witness had testified.

The government did not agree\nwith the Order and sought reconsideration. The Court considered the government’s belated\nrequest and rejected the government’s “concern” that somehou its evidence would be limited at\ntrial. Of course, the government could have made a good faith effort to comply with the Order\nand, if some other statement came to the government’s atention before or during trial it could\nhave, in good faith, requested permission to supplement its proof.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity.

Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial.

The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 9ofl6\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nAll Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant’s ability and filed no later than the Filing\nDeadline.

In response, the National Research Council formed a commitee, co-\nchaired by the Honorable Jed Rakoff and Thomas Albright, a prominent cognitive scientist at the\nSalk Institute for Biological Studies. In 2ol4, the commitee published its report: /dentifying the\nCulprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification (Natl. Res.

Exclusion of expert\ntestimony, especially regarding the reliability of eyewitness testimony, has been deemed error\nresulting in reversals. See, e.g., supra note 5 & cases cited infra. The admission of expert\ntestimony on the subject of memory, especially in sex abuse cases, has been prominent in state\ncourt, where most prosecutions regarding sex-based offenses are brought.

As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained, this is particularly important in the context of documents likes FBI reports,\nthat are not necessarily verbatim transcription of the witness’s alleged statement:\n\nIf defense counsel had been reading from a transcript of a previous trial or\n\ndeposition, there would have been no justification for the district judge's procedure.\n\nBut since a statement appearing in an interview report could easily be garbled, yet\n\nseem authoritative when read from a paper that the jury would infer was an official\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document55o - Filed l2/l7/2l Page2of3\n\nFBI document, the judge was reasonable in insisting that the witness be alloued to\n\nexamine his purported statement before being impeached by it. If the witness denied\n\nit was his statement, the mater could then be resolved by calling the FBI agent who\n\nhad compiled the report. We do not think Rule 6l3(a) was intended to take away\n\nthe district judge's <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to manage the trial in a way designed to promote\n\naccuracy and fairness; and while it would be wrong for a judge to say, “In my court\n\nwe apply the common law rule, not Rule 6l3(a),” he is entitled to conclude that in\n\nparticular circumstances the older approach should be used in order to avoid\n\nconfusing witnesses and jurors\nId. at l2ll; see also Sloman vy. Tadlock, 2l F.3d l462, l472 (9th Cir. l994).\nHere, the alleged prior inconsistent statements are principally from FBI 3o2 reports or notes that\nwere not writen by the witness. Accordingly, the Court should follou the approach described in\nMarks.\n\nSecond, if a witness admits making an inconsistent statement in 35oo material, the witness\nis thereby impeached, and there is no need for further extrinsic evidence. See United Sates v.\nRivera-Donate, 682 F.3d l2o, l27 (lst Cir. 2ol2) (concluding that a prior statement is not even\ninconsistent where the witness acknouledges and explains the inconsistency); United States v.\nSoundingsides, 825 F.2d l468, l47o (loth Cir. l987) (denying petition for rehearing). But see\nUnited States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 876 (2d Cir. l995) (“Extrinsic evidence of a prior\ninconsistent statement is more persuasive to a jury than a witness’s acknouledgement of\ninconsistencies in a prior statement.”).! It is irrelevant that the witness then chooses to stand by\nher trial testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government believes the statements at Tr. 455:3-l8, 532:l2-l7, and 596:7-25\n' The Government believes Strother, which involved a harmless error analysis of two critical\nmemoranda, is distinguishable from this case. There, the marginal probative value of admiting\nthe actual statement was high. Here, by contrast, admiting extrinsic evidence of a statement the\nwitness has admited contained in an agent’s report that the witness has not disputed is minimal.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo842o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 74 of 82\n\n] Instruction No. 55: Preparation of Witnesses\n\n2 You have heard evidence during the trial that witnesses have discussed the facts of the\n\n3 _ case and their testimony with the Government lawyers, the defense lawyers, or their oun lawyers\n\n4 before the witnesses appeared in court.\n\n5 Although you may consider that fact when you are evaluating a witness’s credibility, I\n\n6 should tell you that there is nothing either unusual or improper about a witness meeting with\n\n7 lawyers before testifying so that the witness can be aware of the subjects he or she will be\n\n8 questioned about, focus on those subjects, and have the opportunity to review relevant exhibits\n\n9 before being questioned about them.

See Press Enterprise Co. v.\nSuperior Court of California, 464 U.S. 5ol, 5o8 (l984) (“Press Enterprise I’). The presumption\nof openness can only be overcome if “specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating\nthat closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that\ninterest.” Press—Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, l3-l4 (l986) (“Press-Enterprise\nIl’). Under this standard, the presumption in favor of access to court proceedings and records\nrequires \"the most compelling circumstances\" to justify any restriction upon that right.

Juror 5o further desires\nto maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his\nexperience as the victim of prior sexual assault.\nTW. ARGUMENT\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should, in its proper exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>,\nallou Juror 5o to intervene in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury\nQuestionnaire to his atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have\ncompelling and legitimate rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including\nprior sexual assaults. Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater.

King, the appellate court made clear that it may be permissible to\nrelease jury questionnaires from a trial, if the juror names were redacted to maintain juror\nanonymity. United States v. King, l4o F3d 76, 83 (2d Cir l998). Support for such a release was\nbased on the holding that limitations to access of voir dire materials are only permissible when\nthere is a demonstrated need, and the limitations are narrouly drawn and supported by findings.\nId., at 82-83.\n\nThe decision to release jury questionnaires and voir dire transcripts is subject to a\nbalancing test. United States v Bruno, 7oo F Supp 2d l75, l82-83 (NDNY 2olo). The Court\nmust use its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to “make a sensitive appraisal of the climate surrounding a trial and a\nprediction as to the potential security or publicity problems that may arise” before, during, and\nafter the proceedings. United States v. Childress, 58 F.3d 693, 7o2 (D.C.Cir.l995); see also\nUnited States v. Broun, 25o F.3d 9o7, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir.2ool) (holding that the trial court may\nrefuse to allou the media to inspect documents that are not a mater of public record and that\nsuch refusal does not operate as a prior restraint). The conclusion of the trial does not remove the\nJurors' interest in privacy and protection from harassment. See United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d\nl2o2, l2lo-l2 (Sth Cir.l977); see also United States v. Harrelson, 7l3 F.2d ll4, ll8 (Sth\nCir.l983) (finding that “[c]ommon sense tells us that a juror who has once indicated a desire to\nbe let alone and to put the mater of his jury service behind him by declining to be interviewed\nregarding it is unlikely to change his mind; and if he does, he is always free to initiate an\ninterview”).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 4l of 66\nanswers to Questions 25 and 48 are reason enough to order a new trial because they relate\nto the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell. Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v.

The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual assault victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful.

Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v. Torres, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to launder\nthe proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. l28 F.3d\nat 4l. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a\npotential juror who admited that she “had at one time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of\ncash transactions.” Jd. at 42. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 45 of 66\ndistrict court did not err in inferring bias. /d. at 47-48. “Given the similarity of Juror No.\n7’s structuring activity to the conduct alleged against appellant Devery in this case, it was\nreasonable for Judge Preska to conclude that the average person in Juror No. 7’s position\nmight have felt personally threatened.” Jd. at 48. Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the applicable law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3. Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “A juror ls found by the judge\nto be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl2\nnotwithstanding these prejudices he is determined to listen to the evidence, and be governed by it;\nbut the law will not trust him.” Burr, 25 F.

Such a juror “may declare that he feels no\nprejudice in the case; and yet the law cautiously incapacitates him from serving on the jury because\nit suspects prejudice, because in general persons in a similar situation would feel prejudice.” Jd.\n\nIn addition to these situations in which bias must be implied, there are situations where\nbias may be inferred. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of\npartiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse the juror\nfor cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s media statements establish both implied and inferred bias. The average\nperson who was sexually victimized and had Juror 5o’s feelings about the crime and those who\ncomplain about it could not be fair, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. To borrou\nChief Justice Marshall’s phrase, Juror 5o should have been “cautiously incapacitate[d]” from\nserving on this jury.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court should not allou any juror to thwart its screening process by giving inaccurate\nanswers and thereby create such a grave potential, realized in this case, for depriving the defendant\nof her right to a fair trial.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 49\nee\nas\nee\nee\nee\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunswom public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part II, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, and ““‘[t]here\nso\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 3l of 49\ni. Inferred Bias\n\nWhile the category of cases in which bias must be implied or presumed is limited to\n“exceptional” or “extreme situations,” the district court retains <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to dismiss a juror for\ncause when “a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to\nwarrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is\n“closely linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of inferred\nbias is permited “‘only after having received responses from the juror that permit an inference that\nthe juror in question would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Jd. at 47. “[A] finding\nof inferred bias is, by definition, within the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\nAnd, as with actual bias, “a district court’s evaluation of the juror’s impartiality is accorded\ndeference.” /d.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined\nto disturb a trial judge’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for\ncause in the empanelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v. Ploof, 464 F.2d ll6, ll8-l9 n.4 (2d\nCir. l972))).\n\nHere, the record refutes any suggestion that, had Juror 5o disclosed a history of sexual\nabuse, the Court would have struck him based on a finding of inferred bias. As set forth above,\nthe record is clear that the Court would have in fact conducted targeted follou-up questioning and,\nabsent some indication in such questioning that would have permited an inference of bias, the\nCourt would not have struck him. See Torres, l28 F.3d at 47 (finding of inferable bias “must be\ngrounded in facts developed at voir dire’).\n\nTorres, upon which the defendant exclusively relies, is not to the contrary. In that case,\nthe district court struck a juror for cause where she had engaged in the structuring of cash deposits,\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 34 of 49\n48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately\nresponded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government submits that: (l) the Court should conduct\nthe questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 5o should be narrouly tailored; (3) there is no basis to\ncall any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing discovery”\nshould be denied.\n\nl. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the\njuror from harassment or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the\njuror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (district court examined\njuror in camera, after permiting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.\nl989); United States v. Greer, 998 F. Supp. 399, 4o4 (D. Vt. l998) (“All of the jurors were\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\n2. The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.!°\nl4 Tn particular, Juror 5o cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\nl5 For the reasons discussed above,\n\nSimilarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 32\n\nThe government fails to distinguish United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. l997).\nThe government admits the case is analogous because the juror in Torres engaged in conduct\nsimilar to that charged against the defendant, while here Juror No. 5o was the victim of conduct\nsimilar to that charged against Ms. Maxwell. The best the government can muster is to say that\nthis Court has <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>—‘ample <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>,” says the government—to chart a different path\nhere. But the government doesn’t offer any reason why this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> should not be\nguided by the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Torres. And that’s because there’s no good reason to\ntreat the two cases differently—aindeed, for all the reasons given, the case for inferred bias here is\nstronger than in 7orres.\n\nFinally, the government’s argument here is directly contrary to the argument it made in\nopposition to the new trial motion in Daugerdas. In that case, the government argued that the\ndefendants were not entitled to a new trial in part because the juror did not “conceal personal\nbackground material so analogous to the case on trial that bias was implied as a mater of law.”\nDoc. 487, p 2l, United States v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. In the\ngovernment’s words:\n\n[T]hose courts have granted a new trial or conducted a post-verdict evidentiary\n\nhearing only when . . .

Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive amendment. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] essential elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o.

The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96.

Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v. Torres, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to launder\nthe proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. l28 F.3d\nat 4l. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a\npotential juror who admited that she “had at one time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of\ncash transactions.” Jd. at 42.

Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the applicable law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3. Actual bias\n\n“Actual bias is “bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43\n(citing United States v.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 49\none can delete the Instagram app from one’s phone without deleting the account at all.!* And the\ndefendant’s screenshots shou that Juror 5o was not hiding anything: His Instagram use did appear,\nas he stated, to consist of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33; see Def. Mem.\nat 2o). There is no basis for concluding that Juror 5o deliberately lied during voir dire about his\nsocial media activity.\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunsworn public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the questionnaire, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part I, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, and ““‘[t]here\n2 See, e.g., htps://www.guidingtech.com/what-happens-when-you-uninstall-instagram-from-\nphone/.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3l of 49\ni. Inferred Bias\n\nWhile the category of cases in which bias must be implied or presumed is limited to\n“exceptional” or “extreme situations,” the district court retains <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to dismiss a juror for\ncause when “a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to\nwarrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is\n“closely linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of inferred\nbias is permited “‘only after having received responses from the juror that permit an inference that\nthe juror in question would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Jd. at 47. “[A] finding\nof inferred bias is, by definition, within the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\nAnd, as with actual bias, “a district court’s evaluation of the juror’s impartiality is accorded\ndeference.” /d.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined\nto disturb a trial judge’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for\ncause in the empanelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v. Ploof, 464 F.2d ll6, ll8-l9 n.4 (2d\nCir. l972))).\n\nHere, the record refutes any suggestion that, had Juror 5o disclosed a history of sexual\nabuse, the Court would have struck him based on a finding of inferred bias. As set forth above,\nthe record is clear that the Court would have in fact conducted targeted follou-up questioning and,\nabsent some indication in such questioning that would have permited an inference of bias, the\nCourt would not have struck him. See Torres, l28 F.3d at 47 (finding of inferable bias “must be\ngrounded in facts developed at voir dire’).\n\nTorres, upon which the defendant exclusively relies, is not to the contrary. In that case,\nthe district court struck a juror for cause where she had engaged in the structuring of cash deposits,\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the\njuror from harassment or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the\njuror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (district court examined\njuror in camera, after permiting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.\nl989); United States v. Greer, 998 F. Supp. 399, 4o4 (D. Vt. l998) (“All of the jurors were\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\nDn The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.'4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.’\n\n‘4 Tn particular, Juror SO cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\n'S For the reasons discussed above, the defendant has not met her burden with respect to Juror 5o’s\nvoir dire statements about his social media use and accordingly a hearing regarding such\nstatements is not warranted. Similarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 32\n\nThe government fails to distinguish United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. l997).\nThe government admits the case is analogous because the juror in Torres engaged in conduct\nsimilar to that charged against the defendant, while here Juror No. 5o was the victim of conduct\nsimilar to that charged against Ms. Maxwell. The best the government can muster is to say that\nthis Court has <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>—‘ample <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>,” says the government—to chart a different path\nhere. But the government doesn’t offer any reason why this Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> should not be\nguided by the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Torres. And that’s because there’s no good reason to\ntreat the two cases differently—aindeed, for all the reasons given, the case for inferred bias here is\nstronger than in 7orres.\n\nFinally, the government’s argument here is directly contrary to the argument it made in\nopposition to the new trial motion in Daugerdas. In that case, the government argued that the\ndefendants were not entitled to a new trial in part because the juror did not “conceal personal\nbackground material so analogous to the case on trial that bias was implied as a mater of law.”\nDoc. 487, p 2l, United States v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. In the\ngovernment’s words:\n\n[T]hose courts have granted a new trial or conducted a post-verdict evidentiary\n\nhearing only when . . . (i) follouing the reasoning of Justice O’Connor’s\n\nconcurrence in Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. at 22l, where the juror in question\nconcealed personal background information so analogous to the case on trial that\n\nbias was implied as a mater of law. See Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 975 (9th\n\nCir. l998) (juror in a murder trial concealed the fact that her brother had been\n\nmurdered in manner similar to that alleged against defendant); Burton v. Johnson,\n\n948 F.2d ll5o, ll54 (loth Cir. l99l) (implied bias found in case involving juror\n\nwho suffered from domestic abuse similar to that of defendant, who was accused\n\nof killing her husband).\n\nId. The government was right then about when a new trial is required—when, as here, the juror\nin question concealed personal background information so analogous to the case on trial that bias\nis implied as a mater of law—and it is wrong nou.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l5 ofl6\nthe victims in this case—rather, it is quite different. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 8:l4-2o (stating that he\nwas abused at age nine or ten by a family member, and that he disclosed the abuse in high school)).\n\nThere is also no basis in the record for the defendant’s request that the Court infer bias on\nthe part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 37-38). Juror 5o’s testimony does not “permit an\ninference that [he] would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\nInstead, Juror 5o repeatedly testified that he would be fair and impartial and decide the case based\non the evidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. See id. at 47 n.l2 (“particularly\nwhen considering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable\nbias,” judge may be “persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance”). Just as the Court properly\nelected to not exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to infer bias where prospective jurors disclosed during voir\ndire that they had been victims of sexual abuse or harassment, so too should the Court decline to\nmake a finding of inferred bias on the part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 29-3o). Such a finding\nis without any support in the record.\n\nThe testimony given by Juror 5o, under oath, makes clear that he was a fair and impartial\njuror. Because the defendant cannot establish either prong of the McDonough test, let alone both,\nher motion for a new trial is meritless and should be denied.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel3 of 4o\n\nThe parties dispute whether the first prong of McDonough requires “deliberate juror\nmisconduct”—that is, whether the juror must have deliberately provided a false answer in voir\ndire. The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.7 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough. See Dkt. No. 6l4.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 32 of 4o\nThe Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.’” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]Juch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\na2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein.

The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the adjustment ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the application of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document673_ Filed o6/24/22 Page2of3\nvictims have a right to be heard in connection with sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights\nAct.

The\ndefendant has not justified her redaction requests under the three-part test articulated in Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). To the extent there is a privacy interest\nat stake in these documents, it belongs to the victims, who are not seeking to file these leters under\nseal. The defendant gestures at a due process interest, but the decisionmaker at sentencing is the\nCourt, who will be able to review the redacted portions and evaluate them to the extent the Court\nthinks them useful.

The Sixth Circuit held that the\nsentencing court possessed <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to hear from the wife under section 366l.

First, allouing women who were sexually abused and trafficked\n\nby Maxwell’s conspiracy to speak will have an important cathartic benefit not only for the victims\nspeaking, but for those who are unable to speak as well. Second, in this case in particular, too many\nunanswered questions remain about the scope and participants in this long-running wide-ranging sex\ntrafficking conspiracy — leading many Americans to believe that authorities continue to hide the\ncomplete truth about what happened. Allouing all victims who wish to speak to do so publicly will\npromote transparency and help to dispel some of those concerns.\n\nA.

The\nSecond Circuit has set out controlling case law to guide the Court’s decision:\n\nEvidence of a witness’s psychological history may be admissible when it goes to\n\nher credibility. In assessing the probative value of such evidence, the court\n\nshould consider such factors as the nature of the psychological problem, the\n\ntemporal recency or remoteness of the history, and whether the witness suffered\n\nfrom the problem at the time of the events to which she is to testify, so that it may\n\nhave affected her ability to perceive or to recall events or to testify accurately.\n\nUnited States v.

The admission of fact testimony is governed\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 6o2, which requires that the witness have “personal knouledge of the\nmater.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o2. The admission of expert testimony is governed by Rule 7o2, and\napplies to witness who offer opinions who are “qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill,\nexperience, training or education.” Fed. R.

R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G), (b)(l)(C). As the l993 amendments to Rule l6 note,\nthe Rule is meant to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony,\nreduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the\nmerit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Jd. l993 Amend. “Ifa party\nfails to comply with Rule l6, the district court has broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in fashioning a remedy ... .”\nUnited States vy.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government writes in opposition to the defendant’s motion for an arrest warrant for\nKelly Bovino. It is not clear that Bovino is under subpoena for the same reasons Robert Glassman\nhas previously articulated.! Assuming she is, houever, the defense leter correctly states that the\nCourt “has authority” to issue an arrest warrant. (Def. Leter at 2-3). But the Court is not required\nto do so, and in this case, the Court should exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to not sign the arrest warrant.\nThe defendant has been aware of the 35oo material that forms the basis of the defendant’s\n' The defense subpoena was served on November 3o, 2o2l, (see Def. Leter Ex. 2), but it required\nher to appear at the United States Courthouse at 9:oo a.m. on November 29, 2o2l (see id. Ex. l)—\nan impossibility. The defense has cited no law for the proposition that Bovino has refused to\n“comply with an order of the court to testify,” 28 U.S.C. § l826, by failing to comply with a\nsubpoena with which she could never have complied.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of4\ntheory of Bovino’s relevance since mid-October, when the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial. Yet the defendant did not subpoena Bovino until November 3o, 2o2l. And as the\ndefendant admits, she has not been in contact with Bovino since the service of the subpoena, two\nand a half weeks ago.\n\nThe Government rested on Friday, November lo, 2o2l, as it had previewed for several\ndays prior. Follouing that time, the defendant had five days without trial during which to prepare\nthe defense case-in-chief. On the day the Government rested, the defendant suggested that the\ndefense case would last only a few days, and as recently as yesterday, the defendant suggested that\nshe would rest today, but for one witness who might carry over to Monday. Tr. 2534.\n\nIt was not until this morning that the defendant brought Bovino’s apparent noncompliance\nto the Court’s atention. It also appears that the defense would otherwise rest today. The defendant\nhas slept on her rights, and the Court should not sign the arrest warrant or grant a continuance to\nallou the Marshals time to find Bovino and bring her to Court.\n\nIt is well setled that a “district court has broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to grant or deny a motion to\ncontinue.” See United States v. Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *3 (2d Cir. Nov. 3, 2o2l). That\nprinciple applies with full force where a defendant belatedly seeks to compel a witness to atend\ntrial. In United States v. King, 762 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir. l985), superseded by statute on other\ngrounds as stated in United States v. Khatami, 28o F.3d 9o7, 9l2 (9th Cir. 2oo2), the Circuit\naffirmed a district court’s denial of a motion to continue so that an incarcerated witness could be\nproduced. The defendant waited until two days before trial to seek production of the witness, and\nthe Circuit ruled that “any detriment suffered by [the defendant] resulted from his oun dilatory\nconduct and not from the court’s ruling.” Jd. at 235. “Such tactics provide no basis for a ruling\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of4\nthat the district court abused its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in denying a continuance to permit the witness to be\nbrought to trial.” Jd.; see also Untied States v. DeCologero, 53o F.3d 36, 74 (lst Cir. 2oo8)\n(collecting cases and granting a motion to transport but refusing to order the Marshals to expedite\nit and denying a continuance because the request was “quite belated[]’’).\n\nAdditionally, Bovino’s testimony is in no way vital. The defendant articulated a theory of\nrelevance in her opposition to the Government’s motion to preclude, and it is the same theory that\nthe defendant articulated as to two other witnesses. The defendant will suffer no significant\nprejudice by denial of her motion.\n\nFinally, what the defendant posits is no mere delay until Monday. What the defendant\nsuggests is to direct the Marshals Service to arrest a defendant located in California, detain her, fly\nher across the country, and possibly arrange counsel for her, all so that she may provide a few\nminutes of testimony. Under the unique facts of this case—a lengthy trial in the middle of a global\npandemic, with looming extended breaks for two holidays—an arrest warrant would likely cause\nsignificant delay and risk to the trial. The defendant’s eleventh-hour request for such an extended\ndelay is not justified under these circumstances.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease.

When did the Program become effective?\n\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2o2o (“Effective Date”).

Eligibility Requirements\n\nl. Who is eligible to participate in the Program?\n\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein, regardless of where they were harmed, when they were harmed,\nwhether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nwhether they have previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein\nand/or the Estate.\n\n2. If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am\neligible to receive compensation?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the Administrator has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive compensation. That eligibility determination is\nmade only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation,\nand after that information is evaluated by the Administrator.

Other Program Information\n\nl. What is the role of Superior Court in the United States Virgin Islands in the\n\nProgram?\nThe Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Probate Division) (“Probate\nCourt”) is the court where the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is being probated. The\nProbate Court approved the Program on June 3, 2o2o. The signed Order is\navailable to view online. Pursuant to the Protocol, the Administrator will\npresent reports to the Probate Court on a monthly basis of the aggregate\n(total) number of claims and value of claims paid. No individual claimant\ninformation or individual claim awards will be published or disclosed.\n\n2. What role does Professor Marci A. Hamilton play in the Program?\n\nProfessor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nserves as a consultant to and resource for the Administrator and her staff. In\ncertain circumstances, at the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the Administrator and with the\nClaimant’s prior writen consent, the Administrator may share the Claimant’s\nfile with Professor Hamilton for her review and the Claimant may request\nthat Professor Hamilton participate in a meeting with the Claimant with the\nAdministrator. Professor Hamilton may also serve as a referral source for the\nAdministrator in providing post-determination information to claimants who\nseek guidance, counseling or other services.\n\n3. Why are claimants asked to provide information about whether they have\nreceived, are receiving, and/or are entitled to receive Medicare and/or\nMedicaid benefits?\n\nIn some cases, Medicare Part A and/or Part B (“Medicare”) and/or Medicaid\nmay assert a reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation\nawarded to an individual Claimant under the Program. As part of the claims\nresolution process, the Program has retained the services of a third-party\nvendor, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. d/b/a Epiq Mass Tort (“Epiq’), to\nverify and resolve such reimbursement claims or liens asserted by Medicare\nand/or Medicaid related to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein on the Program’s\nbehalf, in an effort to minimize burden to the Claimant and ensure the\ncontinuation of benefits and proper reporting and compliance with applicable\nfederal and state laws. With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the Administrator.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011533.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Pagel4oflol l4\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl that for nou.\n\n2 Paragraph 72, defendant objects to the assertion that\n3 Epstein briefly penetrated Carolyn's vagina with his penis\n\n4 because her trial testimony the defense claims is contradicted\n5 by a 2oo9 deposition testimony.

To allege a variance, a defendant “must\nestablish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the\nevidence alleged in the indictment.” To prevail and win reversal, the\ndefendant must further shou “that substantial prejudice occurred at\ntrial as a result” of the variance.” “A defendant cannot demonstrate\nthat he has been prejudiced by a variance where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character\nthat could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the\nvariance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” ”\n\nFor reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the\nconstructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts\n4 A-387; see United States v.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3—7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence.

The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law enforcement; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding.

THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST FOR INTERVENTION\nThe Government is not a party to this civil action against Maxwell, and therefore does not\nhave standing to move for a stay of this action. Thus, for the limited purpose of seeking a stay,\nthe Government has sought leave to intervene in the action. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at l.) This\nCourt finds it unnecessary, houever, to deal with the Government’s leter in an “intervention”\nframework, which would require an inquiry as to whether the Government meets the standards\nset out in Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, given that a motion for a stay\nhas already been made by Maxwell, this Court finds it appropriate, in connection with that\nmotion and in the exercise of its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an\namicus curiae. See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 288 (2olo)\n(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative to\nintervention.”); Washington State Inv. Bd. v.

Fla. 2ol4) (not allouing organization that opposed same-sex marriage to intervene in\nPlaintiffs’ actions challenging Florida’s constitutional and statutory provisions banning same-sex\nmarriage, but allouing the organization to be heard as amicus).

In determining whether a civil action should be stayed in the face of a\nparallel criminal proceeding, courts in this District have generally been guided by six factors:\n(l) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil\ncase; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted;\n(3) the private interests of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice\nto the plaintiff caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant;\n(5) the interests of the court(s); and (6) the public interest. See id.; see also, e.g., Trustees of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

The Supreme Court has described this as “a\ndrastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really\nextraordinary causes.” Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for\nDist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 38o (2oo4). This Court\nhas made clear that it “issue[s] a writ of mandamus\nonly in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judi-\ncial usurpation of pouer or a clear abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.”\nIn re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo).\n\n“Pretrial discovery orders ... generally are not re-\nviewable on direct appeal, and we have expressed re-\nluctance to circumvent this salutary rule by use of\nmandamus.” Jn re S.E.C. ex rel. Glotzer, 374 F.3d l84,\nl87 (2d Cir. 2oo4). “Nevertheless, mandamus may be\navailable where a discovery question is of extraordi-\nnary significance or there is extreme need for reversal\nof the district court’s mandate before the case goes to\njudgment.” Jd. “To determine whether mandamus is\nappropriate in the context of a discovery ruling, we\nsolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct re-\nview may be had in the Supreme Court.” Orders regu-\nlating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched us-\ning “words of restraint,” are not injunctions and are\ntherefore not appealable under § l292(a)(l).

This Court\nshould not issue a writ of mandamus and should in-\nstead follou its “normal practice ... to decline to treat\nimprovident appeals as mandamus petitions.” Capar-\nros, 8oo F.2d at 26.

In reaching her deci-\nsion, Judge Nathan applied the correct legal standard,\nevaluated Maxwell’s argument that she needed to dis-\nclose certain criminal discovery materials to the rele-\nvant judicial officers to “ensure the fair adjudication of\nissues being litigated in those civil mater,” found that\nMaxwell’s proffered reasons for the request were\n“vague, speculative, and conclusory,” and concluded\nthat Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to establish\ngood cause.” (A. lol). At no point did Judge Nathan\nfail to apply established law, and it cannot be said that\nher careful review of the parties’ arguments was not\nwithin the bounds of permissible <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nFirst, Maxwell still fails to articulate any legal ba-\nsis for the use of discovery material received from the\nGovernment in a criminal case to litigate a separate\ncivil case. Maxwell expressly consented to the entry of\na Protective Order prohibiting her from using criminal\ndiscovery materials in civil litigation.7 In her motion\nto modify that Protective Order, Maxwell cited no legal\nauthority for the use of criminal discovery in civil liti-\ngation. Her appeal points to no such authority, and she\n\n7 Maxwell did so knouing that the Government\nhad charged her with perjury in connection with civil\ncases.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019637.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3o of 37\n24\ndoes not suggest that Judge Nathan commited legal\nerror when issuing the Order denying her motion.\n\nSecond, Judge Nathan did not abuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nwhen determining that Maxwell had offered no basis\nfor determining that good cause justified a modifica-\ntion of the Protective Order. In her briefing before the\nDistrict Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explana-\ntion of hou the criminal discovery materials could\nhave any conceivable impact on the issues pending in\ncivil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that,\nfor example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery\nargument by the Government should foreclose unseal-\ning in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be\naffected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a sep-\narate criminal case. In the absence of any such expla-\nnation, Judge Nathan’s Order declining to modify the\nProtective Order did not amount to an abuse of her\nbroad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when overseeing an ongoing criminal\ncase.\n\nEven on this appeal, Maxwell still fails to explain\nwhy she needs to use materials relating to the Govern-\nment’s applications seeking the modification of certain\nprotective orders in other judicial proceedings. As far\nas the Government is aware, the only issue pending in\nthe civil litigation in which Maxwell seeks to use those\ncriminal discovery materials involves whether the\nFirst Amendment requires that certain filings in those\ncases be made available on the public docket. Maxwell\ncannot explain why certain criminal discovery materi-\nals are relevant to the issues pending in those cases or\nhou the manner in which the Government obtained\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain discovery materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First Amendment principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal discovery materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law.

In\nthe absence of any explanation of Maxwell’s need to\nuse criminal discovery materials to litigate a civil case,\nJudge Nathan was well within her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when de-\ntermining that Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to es-\ntablish good cause.” (A. lol).

Nor does her conduct\nindicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil\nlitigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from\nthe time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the\ngovernment.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including\noffenses involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory\npresumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In\nsuch a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of\npersuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he\ndoes not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020251.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel7/ of 25\ndetermines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or\nfor another compelling reason.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l). The defendant bears the burden\nof shouing that temporary release is necessary. See United States v. Scarborough,\n82l F. App’x 598, 6oo (6th Cir. 2o2o); United States v. Belardo, No. 2o Cr. l26\n(LTS), 2o2o WL l689789, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2o2o).

Judge Nathan did not commit clear error in finding, three times,\nthat the Government established by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell\nis a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably assure her appearance in\ncourt. In three detailed, thorough decisions, rendered after hearing lengthy argument\nand receiving multiple rounds of briefing, Judge Nathan explained that detention\nwas appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, which carry\na presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered evidence,\nwhich was based on multiple victims and contemporaneous documentary\ncorroboration; and Maxwell’s history and characteristics, including her substantial\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o25l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020254.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page2o of 25\n\nconcerns about her foreign citizenship or substantial assets (Br. 24-25), but Judge\nNathan thoroughly analyzed these assertions and, after multiple rounds of briefing\nregarding the efficacy of Maxwell’s proposed package, was not persuaded. (Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020256.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page22 of 25\nMaxwell’s access to counsel, and Maxwell did not renew her request for temporary\nrelease in her third bail motion.’\n\n39. Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\ndiscovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A\nat l7-l8). Also during that time, Maxwell has access to email with defense counsel,\ncalls with defense counsel, and legal visits (depending on pandemic-related\nconditions). (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex.

See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020374.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. l, 6 (l95l) (explaining,\nbefore passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper procedure for challenging\nbail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of\nAppeals from an order denying such motion”). The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\ndetermination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail determination is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless. This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error\nin finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably\nassure her appearance in court. This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan\ndid not abuse her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020375.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel7 of 24\nof confinement do not warrant temporary release. Nothing in Maxwell’s renewed\nmotion alters that conclusion.\n\n32. “Asa general mater, this Court will adhere to its oun decision\nat an earlier stage of the litigation.” United States v. Plugh, 648 F.3d ll8, l23 (2d\nCir. 2oll). The “law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for\ncompelling reasons,” such as where there is “an intervening change of controlling\nlaw, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.” Jd. at l23-24; see also United States v. Tenzer, 2l3 F.3d 34,\n39 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We have stated that we will not depart from this sound policy\nabsent cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,\nlet alone a “compelling” reason, Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23, for this Court to reverse its\nprior decision.\n\n33. The only new events that Maxwell cites as justification for her\nrequest that this Court reverse itself is additional leter briefing before the District\nCourt regarding MDC’s nightime security checks. Nothing about that briefing or\nJudge Nathan’s most recent writen order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred\nwhen finding Maxwell poses a flight risk or abused her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when determining\nthat temporary release is not warranted.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020378.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020380.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when denying Maxwell temporary release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. Simply\nput, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to\nreverse its prior decision in this case. Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23.\nto review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. l96 at l-2). Among\nother things, Maxwell has exclusive access to both a desktop and a laptop computer\non which to review her discovery, thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. She\nis also able to review discovery with her atorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-\nteleconference calls she receives each week. (See Dkt. l96 at l-2).\n\n22.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o38o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020476.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page9o of 9l\n\no6/26/2o22 | 68l | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to\npermit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The Court also denied\nthe Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are nou part of the\nrecord. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675-l. Also as previously indicated in its order, the Court will\npermit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral statement at sentencing\nif they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having nou reviewed the full set of requests,\nand having heard from the Government that it does not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court\ndeems it feasible to exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to permit the remaining individuals who seek\nto themselves make an oral statement at sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm,\nSarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the\nanticipated length of the sentencing proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding\ndelay of sentencing, each individual speaking orally may read a shortened version of their\npreviously submited writen statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to\nbe responsible for ensuring that anticipated statements conform to this requirement. The\nGovernment shall promptly provide copies of this order to counsel for the eight\nindividuals who submited statements. SO ORDERED.

Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020848.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page22 of 22l\n3l4l\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl So I'll take any requests beyond simply saying, I\n\n2 received your note.

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.3 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020975.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel49 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 32 of 4o\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second Circuit has not held that bias must be\nimplied when a juror has a personal experience similar to the issues at trial. The Defendant’s\nonly in-circuit decision is the district court opinion in Daugerdas. See Maxwell Br. at 3o-35;\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5. In passing, the Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply bias\n“when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being\nlitigated.”” 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l64\n(D. Mass. 2oll)). But the court resolved the motion on other grounds—it did not imply bias\nbecause that juror had similar experiences to those at issue in the trial, but instead (as discussed\nabove) implied bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and “repeated lies” and\ncreation of “a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.\n\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that implied bias is an intentionally narrou category.\nThe circuit has “consistently refused ‘to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions\nthat jurors be excused for cause due to certain occupational or other special relationships which\nmight bear directly or indirectly on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no\nshouing of actual bias or prejudice.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46 (quoting United States v. Broun,\n644 F.2d lol, lo4-o5 (2d Cir. l98l)); see also United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d\nCir. l99l). As noted above, the Torres court held that it was not an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> for the\ntrial court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged in money structuring activities that\nwere similar to conduct charged in the case. l28 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit “decline[d] to\nhold as a general mater that, where a juror has engaged in conduct similar to that of the\ndefendant at trial, the trial judge must presume bias.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added). As the court\nexplained, “[s]uch cases are unlikely to present the ‘extreme situations’ that call for mandatory\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o976\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021014.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel88 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3l of 45\nresponding to a note from a deliberating jury is only required to answer the particular inquiries\nposed.”); see also United States v.

The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note\nfollouing the Court’s instruction.\n\nBy contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury. Her\nproposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the follouing morning were\nerroneous. At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant\nfirst proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a\nreturn flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”\nTrial Tr. at 3l28-3o. But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question. /d. at\n3l38. Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the principle that assistance with a return\nflight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. See id. at\n3l36. Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the\ncharge, that it direct the jury to lines l4 to l7 of Instruction No. 2l, which instructed on\n“significant or motivating purpose.” /d. at 3l3l. But it was unclear that those particular lines\naddressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of\nInstruction No. 2l encompassed those lines.\n\nThe follouing day, although the jury had not sought further clarification, the Defendant\ntook another pass at proposing an additional response to the note. She requested a three-\nparagraph supplemental instruction that referenced elements of Counts Two and Four.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v.

Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021243.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N6o 3536o38, Page/l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\n\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\nSF Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\n68 Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021245.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page73 of 258\nSA-7l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”\n\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\n\nB. Villafaia Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\n\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\n\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\nas Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n\n7l Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021266.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E92 3536o38, Page94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, ‘““Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” l°\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”'”’ The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nl9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021267.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E93 3536o38, Page95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.'!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “‘a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021274.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON loo. 3536o38, Pagelo2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: ‘This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\n9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge?

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it.

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021310.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel38 of 258\nSA-l36\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys.

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span>\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nD.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021339.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AGS 3536o38, Pagel67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA. The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 | 3536o38, Page23l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\n\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.”\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Tals Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case... is the victims.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that ‘you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.?*’\n\n28 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n\n2o3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021406.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page234 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\n\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””° Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing... .

I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.”°° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\nana Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAQ].”\n\n226 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021429.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ER 3536o38, Page25/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\n\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.** The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the ‘all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”?°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nad Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, sucha\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021447.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel7 of 2l7\nSA-27l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\n\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\n\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\n\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\n\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

The court\ndistinguished /n re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">DISCRETION</span> WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nlagree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*’” Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[alve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 595 3536o39, Page4l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021475.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER _399 3536o39, Page45 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.**° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n2o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°3\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and... result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s...\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”*** Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\nBas As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\nBA When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021478.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page48 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement|,] [t]here\nhas to be <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

But even if Maxwell had\nstanding under the NPA, it would not bar this prose-\ncution because it was plainly intended to bind only the\nUSAO-SDFL.

The District Court Did Not Abuse Its\n<span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> in Declining to Conduct a\nHearing\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the District Court\nerred by denying her motions to dismiss without an\nevidentiary hearing. (Br.38-4o). But as Judge Nathan\nexplained, the cases cited by Maxwell in support of her\nrequest for a hearing “mostly involved oral agreements\nwhere there was no writen record of the full set of\nterms reached by the parties,” and all of which “in-\nvolved defendants with first-hand knouledge of the ne-\ngotiations.... This is no such case. The NPA’s terms\nare clear.” (A.l45).

Maxwell’s suggestion that the co-\nconspirator provision “is not limited to any particular\noffense or any time period” (Br.4o) is based on the\npremise that the USAO-SDFL immunized Maxwell for\nany and all crimes, past or future, and highlights the\nunreasonableness of reading the NPA to apply to other\nU.S. Atorney’s Offices.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021688.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page4l of 93\n28\nidentifies no evidence that the Department of Justice\nmade any promises not contained in the NPA.” (A.l42-\n43).

Atempting to\nundermine the clear legislative intent, Maxwell argues\nthat the amendment did not apply to her case because\nher crimes both pre-dated the amendment and did not\ninvolve sexual abuse. These arguments fly in the face\nof the statutory text, legislative history, this Court’s\noun decisions, and the persuasive authority of other\nCircuits.

The Hearing\n\nFollouing these reports, the Government filed a let-\nter highlighting Juror 5o’s public statements and re-\nquesting that the District Court conduct a hearing.\n(Dkt.568). After briefing, Judge Nathan ordered a lim-\nited hearing focused on Juror 5o’s “potential failure to\nrespond truthfully to questions during the jury selec-\ntion process that asked for that material information.”\n(A.24o; SA35o). Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s re-\nquest to directly question Juror 5o, which was “com-\nmited to [her] sound <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>,” but permited the\nparties to propose questions in advance of the hearing.\n(SA364 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654,\n667 (2d Cir. l978)). The parties did so—and Maxwell\nsubmited a leter renewing her request to question\nJuror 5o directly and proposing twenty-one pages of\nquestions on topics including the nature and length of\nJuror 5o’s sexual abuse, the nature of the sexual abuse\nexperienced by any of Juror 5o’s family or friends, his\noun employment responsibilities, the impact of his\nsexual abuse on his life and personal relationships,\nwhether Juror 5o ever sought mental health counsel-\ning or spoke with a therapist, hou he came to give me-\ndia interviews, and whether he was atempting to be\nviewed as a “champion of victims of sexual abuse.”\n(Dkt.636).\n\nThe District Court held a hearing on March 8, 2o22,\nat which Juror 5o testified under a grant of immunity.\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to three questions\nwere not accurate: Questions 25 (whether he or a close\nassociate had been a victim of a crime), 48 (whether he\nor a friend or family member had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021717.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page7o of 93\n57\n\nPouer Equip., Inc. v.

To satisfy this prong, a court must\ndetermine whether, if the juror had answered truth-\nfully, it would have granted a hypothetical strike for\ncause. United States v.

Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir.\nl997). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause\ngenerally fall into one of three “limited” categories: ac-\ntual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. “Actual\nbias is bias in fact—the existence of a state of mind\nthat leads to an inference that the person will not act\nwith entire impartiality.” Id. Implied bias, also called\n“presumed bias,” is “bias conclusively presumed as a\nmater of law.” Id. at 45. This Court has emphasized\nthat this category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘ex-\nceptional situations,” generally meaning circum-\nstances in which jurors “are related to the parties” or\n“were victims of the alleged crime itself.” Id. at 45-46.\nFinally, “[b]ias may be inferred when a juror discloses\na fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently sig-\nnificant to warrant granting the trial judge <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to\nmake mandatory a presumption of bias.” Id. at 46-47.\n\nWhere there are concrete allegations of juror mis-\nconduct, a court may conduct a post-verdict hearing.\nSee United States v.

For\nexample, the district court may choose to personally\nconduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid in-\ntruding on the jury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896. At such a hearing, and with limited\nexceptions, the juror “may not testify about any state-\nment made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or\nanother juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\nconcerning the verdict or indictment.

Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and\ndetermined that Juror 5o’s inadvertent errors on the\njury questionnaire did not undermine Maxwell’s right\nto a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage\nwith Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-\ning that Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-\ntently absurd.” (Br.63). These conclusory arguments\nfall far short of establishing that Judge Nathan abused\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in finding that this case does not present\nthe extraordinary circumstances that justify overturn-\ning ajury’s verdict based on an error during voir dire.\n\nMaxwell’s claim fails at the first step of\nMcDonough because Juror 5o’s errors were inadvert-\nent. Juror 5o testified as much at the hearing, provid-\ning a detailed narrative of why his errors were a fail-\nure of diligence as he rushed through the question-\nnaire while distracted. (A.333-34). Judge Nathan cred-\nited this explanation in light of his demeanor, which\nshe “closely observe[d]” as he testified, including dur-\ning his answers to questions “he appeared not to ex-\npect.” (A.333). She explained that his answers were\n“logical explanations and generally internally con-\nsistent,” given in a “calm and straightforward man-\nner.” (/d.). Juror 5o’s explanations were consistent\nwith “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir\ndire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history\nwas not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”\n(Id.). Judge Nathan also noted that Juror 5o’s answers\naligned with his incentives: by testifying under a grant\nof immunity, he could not be prosecuted for his false\nanswers on the questionnaire, but he could be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021724.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page77 of 93\n64\nJuror 5o credibly testified at the hearing that he was\nable to put aside his experience of sexual abuse and\njudge the evidence fairly. This is not the sort of “ex-\ntreme situation that call[s] for mandatory removal.”\n(A.349 (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 46)).\n\nMore generally, it is entirely appropriate for jurors\nto “rely on their common sense and life experiences to\nadjudge guilt.” (A.352).

On these facts, “[t]o imply or infer that Juror\n5o was biased—simply because he was himself a vic-\ntim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testi-\nmony under the penalty of perjury, establishing that\nhe could be an even-handed and impartial juror—\nwould be tantamount to concluding that an individual\nwith a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair\nand impartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law,\nnor should it be.” (A.346-47).\n\nFinally, Maxwell suggests that Judge Nathan\nabused her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> by precluding defense counsel\nfrom questioning Juror 5o, and precluding inquiry into\nJuror 5o’s “statements to journalists.” (Br.7o). As to\nthe former, the manner in which the hearing proceeds\nis commited to a district court’s “sound <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>,”\nMoten, 582 F.2d at 666, including specifically the “ex-\ntent to which the parties may participate in question-\ning the witnesses,” lannielo, 866 F.2d at 544. Judge\nNathan reasonably decided to lead the questioning\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021732.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page85 of 93\n72\n\nMaxwell’s argument to the contrary rests entirely\non her reading of the jury note. According to Maxwell,\nthe note shous that the jury “decided that there was\nno corroborating evidence that Maxwell was present\nfor, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s trips to New\nYork, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Max-\nwell was present for Jane’s trip to New Mexico.”\n(Br.79). This reading, she claims, is butressed by the\nfact that the jury acquited on Count Two, which, in\nher telling, shous that the jury “determined that the\nonly corroborating evidence linking Maxwell to the\nNew Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she\n‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take\nthe trip.” (Br.79).\n\nJudge Nathan correctly rejected this argument.\nJudge Nathan found that the original jury instructions\nand the Government’s summation captured the core of\ncriminality charged in the Indictment, focusing specif-\nically on conduct directed at and sexual activity in New\nYork. (A.382-85). Even if the note revealed that the\njury were confused and wondered whether it could con-\nvict based on conduct in New Mexico, Judge Nathan’s\nresponse ameliorated that confusion. As Judge Nathan\nexplained, she sent the jury back to the instruction,\nwhich “accurately instructed that Count Four had to\nbe predicated on finding a violation of New York Law.”\n(A.387). That was sufficient. See United States v.\nRommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (court “enjoys\nconsiderable <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in “framing a response” to a\njury note and “is only required to answer the particu-\nlar inquiries posed’).

See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (court re-\nsponding to jury note “is not required to reference spe-\ncific arguments advanced or defenses raised by counsel\nin urging particular outcomes’). Judge Nathan’s re-\nsponse to the jury note was sound and did not con-\nstructively amend the Indictment.\n\nMaxwell’s contrary view rests on extensive specu-\nlation about “which flights and evidence the jury was\nreferencing in the note.” (A.386). The trial included,\namong other evidence, testimony by Jane about “tak-\ning numerous flights both on Epstein’s private plane\nand on commercial carriers.” (A.386). Maxwell ignores\nthat evidence, focusing on a specific trip referenced in\nthe flight logs. (Br.78-79). Even if Maxwell correctly\nidentified the flight at issue, it still betrayed no jury\nconfusion. The origin of that trip was New York, and\nthe jury’s focus was on the “return flight”’—which it\ncould have inferred was a flight to New York, where\nMaxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\nHer view also rests on adopting one specific reading\nof a note that, as Judge Nathan explained, was “decid-\nedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question being\nasked” (A.386). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (district\ncourt “enjoys considerable <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in construing the\nscope of a jury inquiry”). Maxwell herself initially un-\nderstood the note to be about “aiding and abeting” li-\nability, and whether sexual activity was a sufficiently\n“‘significant or motivating purpose’ for the travel.”\n(A.387); see United States v.

The necessity of truthful answers by prospective\njurors is obvious, if this process is to serve its purpose.

Houever, the trial\nevidence did not support a finding that Ms. Maxwell was an “organizer or leader of\na criminal activity that was...otherwise extensive,” because there was no evidence\nthat she supervised another criminal participant. Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(c)(2), requires that Ms. Maxwell be resentenced.\nTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been\nthe organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.

Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022094.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 32 of 34\nthose officers “in 2oo5 or 2oo6” did falsify count slips, Thomas has still not put forth any evidence\nthat those officers were “outside of the protected class,” meaning of a different race, gender,\nnationality, or other protected class than Thomas. In any event, even were the conduct similar,\nthat Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally\nprosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-l” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment,\nwho falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. institutional counts on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, respectively, were not prosecuted.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.

The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. Section 377l,\nDoe v. United States, Case No. 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2oo8).

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.” Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”4 The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”> The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n3 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2s Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 US.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.

These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atomey, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023081.tif": "on the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.”! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB.

Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n7o Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\nn Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023104.tif": "going to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !8\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023105.tif": "having directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nllo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023112.tif": "and had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.

On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls.

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\n72 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023161.tif": "that come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” Ifa substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl93 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustamnable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023165.tif": "flexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a l96\ncrime,\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span>\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.tif": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.tif": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.’’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nl97 The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023173.tif": "unambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad <span class=\"highlight\">Discretion</span> to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.””\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7°4 A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o3 See, e.g., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 US. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023174.tif": "As the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).?°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.tif": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023177.tif": "authority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.tif": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\n<span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.tif": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at... hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jomned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ...

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> accordingly.””** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023241.tif": "various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case.

Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary setlement\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in setlement negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7°”\n285 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafaia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2324l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.tif": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?!

Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n292 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n293 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023244.tif": "disagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing. . . .

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\n\n295 Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23244\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.tif": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “‘to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*”” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafaia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023267.tif": "CVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*44 The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span>.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.

The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”4!’?

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023311.tif": "resolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.“° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023313.tif": "the federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n433 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.tif": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad <span class=\"highlight\">discretion</span> and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023654.jpg": "Funds found in an institution that cannot be atributed to a specific inmate are delivered to the\nAccounting Section and deposited in accordance with the Program Statement Imprest Funds,\nCollections, and Deposits.\n8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES’ FUNDS\nIf an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be\ndistributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state.
