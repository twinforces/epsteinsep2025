In addition, Ms.\nRansome timed the release of her memoir, “Silenced No More,” (December 7, 2o2l) and book\ntour to coincide with her atendance at the trial .\nThe Sentencing Proceeding Should Not Be a Bully Pulpit for Anyone Who Claims Abuse\nThe prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein was an opportunity for alleged victims who were\ndisenfranchised in connection with Epstein’s Florida sweetheart deal to have their voices heard.\nEpstein’s untimely death follouing his arrest dealt a further blou to his accusers. Follouing\nEpstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an\nopportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the\nCVRA. Kate, Virginia Giuffre, and Sarah Ransome each spoke at that hearing, Annie Farmer\nspoke solely on behalf of her sister, Maria Farmer. See United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (Dkt.\n53). But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here. While it is appropriate for the public to be present and for legitimate CVRA\n> Noticeably missing from Ms. Ransome’s statement is conduct that very well may have contributed to\nher allegations: She was high-priced “escort’ for Emperor’s Club, the agency patronized by Elliot Spitzer.\nLitigation cited in her impact statement revealed that in or about October 2oo6, Ms. Ransome work for an\nagency, got paid thousands of dollars per “escort” and engaged in sexual activity. A modeling photo of\nMs. Ransome produced in her discovery appeared on the Emperor’s Club <span class=\"highlight\">advertisement</span>. The government\nprosecuted the Emperor’s Club ouners.
