Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000313.jpg": "Case 9:o8-CASD ASEARAINO49AcRMEnt 2ScmMenicgfed orF HESS MERE o7RRIERLET Frage 9 of 2o\n48 at 6 J 8; see also DE 99 at 3, and government atorneys have on multiple occasions offered to\nconfer with Petitioners, see, e.g., July ll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr. at l3 (“TI will always confer, sit doun\nwith Jane Doe | and 2, with the two agents and Ms. Villafana.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial.

In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation.

Applicable Law\n\n“{T]he Supreme Court has recognized three purposes for the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouers, ‘to\nimplement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring\nthat a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy\n\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 239\ndesigned to deter illegal conduct.’” Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (quoting United States v.\nHastings, 46l U.S. 499, 5o5 (l983)). “Houever, while there are times when a district court may\nproperly find it absolutely necessary[, in order] to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice\nsystem, to suppress evidence under its inherent or <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority, ‘the Supreme Court has\nexplained that a court’s inherent pouer to refuse to receive material evidence is a pouer that must\nbe sparingly exercised [only in cases of] manifestly improper conduct by federal officials.” United\nStates v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (alterations and emphasis in original) (internal\nquotations and citations omited).

Discussion\nBy asking the Court to exercise its inherent authority, the defendant apparently means to\nsuggest that the Court should grant the relief she seeks, even if she has failed to establish a violation\nof the Constitution or other governing law. The defendant fails to provide justification for the\nextraordinary remedy of suppression or to cite persuasive case law in favor of such an\nextraordinary use of the Court’s inherent authority.\nllo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 239\n\nThe law is clear that a district court’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority does not extend to suppressing\nevidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.\nat 737 (holding that “the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered\nlimitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976\n(2d Cir. 2ol4) (same); United States v. Jennings, 96o F.2d l488, l49l (9th Cir. l992) (“Absent a\nviolation of a recognized right under the Constitution, a statute, or a procedural rule, a district court\nis not entitled to exclude evidence as a sanction against government practices disapproved of by\nthe court.”). The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority. Consistent with that principle, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 4ol-o2 (“We can\nappreciate the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact\nthe integrity of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an\nadversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing\nevidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise\nits <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth\nAmendment right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot\nbe described as a recognized right.” (internal citations omited)).\n\n6.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 348\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 348\nfor the Department’s Criminal Division, a position in which he served as Chief of Staff to Assistant\nAtorney General Alice Fisher. Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafaia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.? Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo32o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span>\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages.

After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team.

Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b).

As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate.

This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3355", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3384", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o9 of 348\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims. I knew that State charges had nothing to do with me.\nao Dan Mangan, ““Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,” New York\nPost, Oct. l, 2oo7.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges.

The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv.

Here, based on the record of the government’s contacts\nwith Boies Schiller in the months before and after Maxwell’s depositions, there is at least a\ngenuine question of fact as to the government’s role in encouraging Boies Schiller.\n\nWe knou that the government contemplated a perjury prosecution of Maxwell, as seen in\nthe government’s newly-disclosed notes from the meeting. Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. K, p\n5. And if the government is to be believed, there was only one meeting with Boies Schiller, two\nmonths before Maxwell’s first deposition. If the government was contemplating a perjury\nprosecution before Maxwell even testified, it stands to reason that Boies Schiller and the\ngovernment discussed at the February 29 meeting a plan to set a perjury trap for Maxwell.\n\nIndeed, the contemporaneous notes of the February 29 meeting shou that Boies Schiller\npromised to send the government “depositions,” Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nMDC Legal persists in falsely accusing Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of violating MDC\nBrooklyn’s legal visit procedures. This allegation is reckless, false, and defamatory. At no time\ndid counsel provide documents to Ms. Maxwell for her retention that did not originate from Ms.\nMaxwell. The April 29\" leter from MDC Legal states that \"<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> staff...reviewed video\nsurveillance footage\" but notably does not state the contents of that video surveillance. The fact\nthat MDC Legal does not claim to have reviewed the video or report the contents of the video\nfootage speaks volumes.\n\nFurther and contrary to MDC’s leter, MDC staff did in fact “seize and retain” Ms.\nMaxwell’s confidential legal documents after the legal visit on April 24. While most of those\ndocuments were returned to Ms. Maxwell, other documents, which the MDC concedes were\n“confiscated,” were not returned to her but rather given to her counsel the next day. As\npreviously stated, documents returned to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was “legal mail” which had\nbeen sent to Ms. Maxwell some time prior to April 24. Counsel did not bring those documents\ninto the facility.\n\nThe MDC admits, and flouts the fact, that guards read Ms. Maxwell’s confidential\nmaterials. This is no small mater. Ms. Maxwell is working tirelessly to review and discuss with\nher atorneys literally millions of pages of documents. Deterioration of her confidential\ncommunications with her atorneys does not produce a fair and just trial.\n\nWe press our request that the Court direct the MDC to provide Ms. Maxwell’s counsel\nwith a copy of the video recording.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Doubling doun on an increasingly\nfarfetched story, houever, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it\nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.\n\nContrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor\nfrom the public corruption unit of the United States Atorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,\naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of\nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.\n\nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would\nnever have obtained the 9o,ooo pages of material it nou possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention\ninjustice, to allou the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government\ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.\n\n“Tn a situation like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer to make it\nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to oun up to it was\nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l4l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 7 of 34\nWang v.

The Remedy for the Government’s Misconduct.\n\nA. Pursuant to its Inherent Pouer, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence\nObtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are\nthe Fruits of that Evidence.\n\nThis Court has inherent authority to regulate the administration of criminal justice among\nthe parties. McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 34o (l943). “Judges have an obligation to\nexercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility\nthat ‘implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and\nevidence.” United States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. l996) (quoting McNabb, 3l8\nU.S. at 34o). As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Payner, “Federal courts may use\ntheir <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer in some circumstances to exclude evidence taken from the defendant by\n‘willful disobedience of law.’” 447 U.S. 727, 735 (l98o) (quoting McNabb, 3l8 U.S. at 345)\n(citing Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 2o6, 223 (l96o); Rea v. United States, 35o U.S. 2l4,\n2l6-l7 (l956); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 (l976) (Pouell, J., concurring in\njudgment)). A court should invoke its <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer of suppression when “there has been a\nfraud upon the court in addition to a violation of the defendant’s rights.” United States v.\nCortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o).\n\nIn United States v. Cortina, a magistrate issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit\nsubscribed by FBI Agent Linda Stewart, which itself was based on the reports and investigation\nof FBI Agent William Broun. /d. at l2o8. Unbeknounst to Agent Stewart, Agent Broun’s\nSecond Circuit in Broun v. Maxwell held a few months after Judge McMahon’s ruling that Maxwell had\nreasonably relied on the Protective Order’s guarantee of confidentiality in substantial part, and it therefore\nredacted sua sponte from the summary judgment material those “deposition responses concerning\nintimate maters where the questions were likely only permited—and the responses only compelled—\nbecause of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, n.22 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (citing\nFed. R. Civ. P. 5.2). So, too, has Judge Preska redacted substantial material from the documents she has\nreleased on remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that Maxwell reasonably relied on the\nProtective Order.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l6o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 26 of 34\nreports were replete with misrepresentations and outright lies about the conversations he had\nwith, and information provided by, a confidential informant. /d. at l2l2-l3. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed the district court’s order suppressing the evidence obtained from the search\nconducted under the warrant. /d. at l2l3. “This search,” said the Court, “never should have taken\nplace.” Id.\n\nThe Court offered two bases for its decision. It first invoked the Franks analysis to affirm\nthe district court’s conclusion that Agent Broun intentionally or recklessly misrepresented\nmaterial information in Agent Stewart’s affidavit. /d. But the Court went further, concluding that\nsuppression was independently required as a mater of inherent authority. Jd. at l2l4-l7.\nBecause Agent Broun lied in the affidavit (in addition to lying at the Franks hearing), “[t]he call\nfor the court’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer under the[] circumstances is at its strongest and most\ndefensible.” /d. at l2l4.\n\nThe Court recognized that the inherent authority doctrine is not a free pass for courts to\nsuppress evidence or “merely [to] disagree with the method|[s] of law enforcement.” /d. “[T]he\nfederal <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer does not give ‘the federal judiciary a ‘chancellor’s foot’ veto over law\nenforcement practices of which it (does) not approve.’” Jd. (quoting United States v. Russell, 4ll\nUS. 423, 435 (l973)). Even so, inherent authority is properly invoked to “prevent[] the court\nfrom condoning a fraud perpetrated upon it.” /d. Suppression serves both to deter unlawful\ngovernmental conduct and to protect judicial integrity. /d. (weighing “the deterrent values of\npreventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated . . . and the need to\nprotect the integrity of the federal courts against the cost to society of excluding ‘probative but\ntainted evidence’”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 28 of 34\nmaterial information to a federal judge in an ex parte proceeding, “[t]he call for the court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer .. . is at its strongest and most defensible.” Cortina, 63o F.2d at l2l4.\n\nMaxwell need not satisfy the standard of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978) in\norder to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a\nFranks hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary shouing,” United States v.\nFalso, 544 F.3d llo, l25 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at l55-56), that (l) there were\n“iaccuracies or omissions” in the affidavit, (il) “the alleged falsehoods or omissions were\nnecessary to the issuing judge’s probable cause or necessity finding,” and (ll) “the claimed\ninaccuracies or omissions [were] the result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless\ndisregard for the truth.” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 397 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Here, there\nis no dispute that (l) AUSA |g representations to Judge McMahon were false and\nmisleading, (i) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the\nsubpoena if AUSA gg had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA gg statements\nwere deliberately false, since he had a “complete handle on the landscape” months before he\nappeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon.\n\nNor need Maxwell prove “outrageous government conduct” to obtain relief. Were that\nher burden, houever, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. “The concept of fairness embodied\nin the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is\nfundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of Justice.” United States v. Schmidt,\nlo5 F.3d 82, 9l (2d Cir. l997). To prevail on an outrageous government conduct claim, “a\ndefendant must shou that the government's conduct is ‘so outrageous that common notions of\nfairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22 of 349\nD.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 32 of 349\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span>\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7o of 349\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\n6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\nob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She percetved that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority” that warranted.\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 89 of 349\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions.

Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ... to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafa\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l84 of 349\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting .. . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo448l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o9 of 349\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004507.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2lo of 349\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff... .\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase.

According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (l984). The Court\nagrees that, at the very least, the exception to the exclusionary rule for inevitable discovery\napplies to the documents that have since been unsealed and made public in the civil case. But\nbecause the Court finds no violation of the Fourth Amendment, it concludes that none of the\ndocuments should be suppressed.\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent\n\nauthority\n\nMaxwell next argues that the materials must be suppressed because the Government\nviolated her due process rights in obtaining them. The gravamen of this claim is that the\nGovernment misrepresented its prior contacts with BSF to Judge McMahon. Maxwell contends\nthat this misrepresentation violated her due process rights, or alternatively that the Court should\nexercise its inherent authority to suppress the evidence obtained through the subpoena as a\nsanction for governmental misconduct. She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result. She further seeks an evidentiary\nhearing to explore whether any misrepresentation by the Government in that hearing was\nintentional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts have a limited inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence obtained in “willful disobedience of law.” United States v. Payner, 447 USS.\n727, 735 n.7 (l98o) (quoting McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 345 (l943)). But it has\nalso cautioned that courts must exercise this pouer with restraint. /d. Thus, “the court should\nnot exercise its inherent or <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer ‘as a substitute for Fourth Amendment\nJurisprudence.’” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting United\nStates v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 792 (2d Cir. l996)).

See Payner, 447 US. at 735.\n\nMaxwell has not established a violation of due process or justified the exercise of the\nCourt’s inherent <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority. Not every misstep by the Government during a criminal\ninvestigation justifies suppressing relevant evidence. The Supreme Court has repeatedly\nexplained that the exclusionary rule weighs the interest in deterring investigatory misconduct\nagainst the truth-seeking function of the judicial process. That balance “do[es] not change\nbecause a court has elected to analyze the question under the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer instead of” some\nother constitutional provision. /d. at 736. Due process provides an independent basis to suppress\nevidence only when the Government engages in conduct that is “fundamentally unfair or\nshocking to our traditional sense of justice” or is “so outrageous that common notions of fairness\nand decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a conviction against\nthe accused.” United States v. Schmidt, lo5 F.3d 82, 9l (2d Cir. l997) (internal quotation marks\nomited). “Ordinarily such official misconduct must involve either coercion or violation of the\ndefendant’s person.” /d. (citations omited). This case involves neither. Omiting information\nabout communications with BSF years earlier falls well short of the sort of extreme misconduct\nsupporting suppression as a mater of due process.\n\nTo the extent Maxwell asks the Court to engage in a freewheeling exercise of its inherent\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouer instead, the Court declines to do so. To begin with, suppression under a\ncourt’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority is only appropriate, if at all, when the Government has engaged in\n“willful disobedience of law.” Payner, 447 U.S. at 735 n.7 (emphasis added).

(Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v.

Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992).

Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO.

After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.

Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021240.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N66 3536o38, Page68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021243.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N6o 3536o38, Page/l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 69 of 348\non the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\n\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your\nSF Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting\non OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with\nserious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of\ntrafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”\n68 Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.\n69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]\nplace” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”\nMenchel, houever, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority” that warranted\nhis strong response.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021262.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O88 3536o38, Page9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI.

OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard.

The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, lasked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, ... “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ...to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021357.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l83 3536o38, Pagel85 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings .. . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting. . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l357", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021382.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page2lo of 258\nSA-2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE, Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021383.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2ll of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o9 of 348\nthe defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just... all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021408.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 334 3536o38, Page236 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”°”!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°” Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-\nstein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s assistant.\n(A.4l7; see Tr.l39-4o, l89o).

Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> lapses, and the application of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions.

Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him.

Thomas has failed to meet\nhis burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid\ndefense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead\nwould be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification.\n\nThe purported reasons for Thomas’s decision to falsify count slips—being tired,\noverworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those\nissues is not relevant.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n72 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nao After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span>\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.jpg": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’3%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n32 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.jpg": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023081.jpg": "on the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this\nmater has been for shou.\n\nNor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the\nUSAM or any other policy well taken.

She disagreed, houever, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta\nand Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that\nmeeting.®® Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel\nmentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”\n\nA week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the\nprocess and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:\n\nHi Mat -- My trial is over, so I nou have [ ] time to focus back on\n\nthis case and our e-mail exchange.

The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children.

As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard.

See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “TI always figured Mat just wanted ... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023195.jpg": "OPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\nrecognized that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023220.jpg": "D. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2322o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023221.jpg": "the defendant faced decades in prison for sexual crimes against minors with such an insignificant\nterm of incarceration, and made numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff. ...\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.jpg": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh ivalve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\naio OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents.

We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n222 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\na3 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023246.jpg": "involved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, ‘“[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°* Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York.

At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9.

This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB.

The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The <span class=\"highlight\">Supervisory</span> Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023422.jpg": "The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they\ndid not knou Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of\nthe second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3's impending\ntransfer out of MCC New York on August 9.

According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU\nthat evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said\nSHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate.

The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that\nEpstein needed a cellmate; houever, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant should have knoun of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the\nPsychology Department on July 3o, 2ol9, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an\nappropriate cellmate. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email\nnotifying MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York. The\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate\nand did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on\nAugust lo, as part of her Lieutenant rounds.\nThe Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not atended SHU training, but he\nhad worked in the SHU approximately lo to 2o times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he\nreported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nshift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and\nasked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The Material Handler said\nhe worked the 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him\nworking 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9 through l2 a.m. on August lo. After the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge left at lo p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the\nSHU from lo p.m. to l2 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting\nwith his atorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned\nto his cellon L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said\nthey left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that\nEpstein needed a cellmate.\nNoel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, which was a double shift of l6 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time\nthat Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU\nwere typically assigned cellmates, but she did not knou if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said\nEpstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her\nabout a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not knou that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been\nassigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.\nMaterial Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August lo from l2 a.m.\nuntil 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous\nprevious occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he knew that if\nan inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he\nsaid he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological observation.\nTherefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with\nhim about that requirement.

Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround.

Contrary to\nBOP training for new Lieutenants, which she atended in 2oll, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\ntold the OIG, “We are not required to go to each individual cell and look at the inmates. When we make\nrounds, we get with the officers.” The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said she did not conduct a\nround to observe the inmates when she visited the SHU. Noel confirmed that the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant visited the SHU but did not walk doun the tiers.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the\nOIG determined that at approximately 4 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nbriefly visited the SHU as part of her <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> duties and conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were\nseated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU.

Epstein’s Death on August lo\nA. Discovery of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response\nOn August lo, 2ol9, shortly after 6 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of breakfast\ncarts had arrived at the SHU. Noel and Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-locked\nentrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas and Noel were the only officers\nin the SHU. At approximately 6:3o a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings shou Noel and\nThomas walking touard the L Tier. Noel and Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering the\nL Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, between\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, the OIG did not observe\non the available recorded video any COs or other individuals approach the L Tier where Epstein was housed\nfrom the common area of the SHU.\nNoel told the OIG that she unlocked the door to the L Tier so Thomas could deliver the breakfast trays.\nThomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein’s cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the windou\nbut could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, “Come to the door, come to the door.” Thomas\nsaid he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell,\nand saw Epstein hanged as described further belou. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get\nhelp, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps\ndescribed belou.\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023467.jpg": "The OIG investigation also found that during the next shift in the MCC New York SHU, both the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate. The Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when he escorted Epstein back to his cell after Epstein’s\ntelephone call, he saw that Inmate 3 was not there and then he, Noel, and the Material Handler discussed\nthe need for Epstein to have a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge also told the OIG\nthat he notified an unspecified supervisor. Houever, other witnesses did not corroborate his account. Noel\ntold the OIG that she was unaware both that Epstein needed to have a cellmate and that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from the institution. Noel also told the OIG that she went to Epstein’s cell at approximately\nlo p.m.—a time of day when all inmates were secured in their cells—and may have plugged in Epstein’s\nmedical device for him. The OIG did not credit Noel's statements that she did not knou that Epstein needed\na cellmate or that Inmate 3 had been removed from the SHU based on contradictory witness statements\n(including her oun) regarding SHU staff's knouledge of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and Inmate 3’s\ntransfer out of the SHU.®\nThe OIG investigation concluded that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel failed to notify a supervisor as required after Epstein’s cellmate was\npermanently removed from the MCC New York SHU, which constituted a violation of BOP standards of\nconduct. Additionally, their inaction violated MCC New York SHU Post Orders because none of these\nindividuals documented the fact the Epstein needed a new cellmate as required. Finally, all of these officers\nfailed to exercise good judgment and common sense, as required by the SHU Post Orders, by not\nimmediately undertaking steps through their chain-of-command to ensure that a high-profile inmate who\nhad been released from suicide watch and psychological observation lo days earlier had an\nappropriate cellmate.\n2. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was housed without a cellmate at the time of his death. Rather\nthan passively relying on a notification from subordinates, <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> personnel also had an obligation\nunder federal regulations to “put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties,” which included\nsupervision of SHU personnel.®” The OIG's investigation revealed that the Captain and the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, and\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, among other MCC New York staff, received an email from the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS) on August 8, 2ol9, notifying them that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be\ntransferred to another facility the follouing day. If any of these supervisors had read the email atachment,\nthey would have knoun of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate. Instead, many of these individuals\ntold the OIG that they believed that Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9 and they were unaware that he\nwould not return and Epstein needed a new cellmate. The SHU Lieutenant's shift on August 8 ended over\nan hour before the USMS sent the email notification and he was not working on August 9.

Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023471.jpg": "inmate was accounted for.’”® Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and\nthe numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the\ninstitutional count be deemed “cleared” or completed.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or\nsigned a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability\nresponsibilities when, in fact, they had not.’”” These individuals admited to the OIG that instead of\nperforming their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed\nwere in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the\ndocuments knouing that they falsely atested to having completed the counts.

The U.S. Atorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions.

Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 4%) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023473.jpg": "count.

The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023479.jpg": "MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation states that inmates on psychological\nobservation will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member.\n\nA review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2ol9, revealed Epstein was alloued to leave the\nsuicide watch room to visit with his atorneys for more than 6 hours. According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York <span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\n<span class=\"highlight\">supervisory</span> personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.

Atached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permiting staff monitored suicide watches in\nSHU.\nWith regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter. A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2.

If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior.

The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision.
