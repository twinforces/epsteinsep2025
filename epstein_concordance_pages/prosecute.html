The Judiciary Act of l789\ncreated the Office of the United States Atorney, along with the office\nof the Atorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided\nfor the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to\nact as atorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn\nor affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall\nbe to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences,\ncognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil\nactions in which the United States shall be concerned.” '° The Judiciary\nAct thus emphasized that U.S. Atorneys would enforce the law of the\nUnited States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S.\nAtorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact,\nthe phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of\n5 United States Atorney’s Manual § 9-27.64l (2oo7).\n'6 An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 2o, § 35, l Stat. 73, 92-93\n(l789) (emphasis added).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooool3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000014.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-l, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Pagel3 of 26\nthe actions and the duties of the U.S. Atorneys would be limited to\ntheir oun districts, absent any express exceptions.\n\nSince l789, while the number of federal districts has groun\nsignificantly, the duties of a U.S. Atorney and their scope remain\nlargely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Atorneys, “within [their] district,\nshall (l) <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for all offenses against the United States; (2)\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or\nproceedings in which the United States is concerned.” Again, the\nscope of the duties of a U.S. Atorney is cabined to their specific district\nunless otherwise directed.'®\n\nIn short, Annabi controls the result here. Nothing in the text of\n\nthe NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded\nUSAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the\n7 28 U.S.C. § 547.\n'8 This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Atorney’s pouers do not\nextend beyond their districts.

The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation.

Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request.

Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench competent authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities.

Yet, it is in precisely this\nseting—involving a defendant who, despite her years of denials, has been publicly atacked,\nthreatened, and vilified like few others in recent memory—that the government’s scrupulous\nadherence to the law in prosecuting a criminal defendant is most critical.

The government (and state authorities)\ninvestigated Epstein thoroughly in 2oo6 for alleged conduct that is essentially identical to the\nconduct alleged in the current indictment. In 2oo7, the government’s investigation was resolved\nwhen it entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Epstein, which was negotiated\nunder the supervision of R. Alexander Acosta, then United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”), and approved by senior levels of Main Justice, including the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General. In that NPA, the government agreed that any federal\nprosecution of Epstein in the SDFL would be deferred in exchange for Epstein’s agreement to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 38\nEpstein’s equal—if not his superior—and baselessly caricatured as a villain of near-mythical\nproportions. Only at this time did the government, according to its oun account, decide to\nlaunch an investigation of Ms. Maxwell and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> her on allegations that it had previously,\nrepeatedly (and properly, since any charges would have been baseless) determined did not merit\ncharges. In short, the government’s response to the media frenzy was not to adhere to its earlier\nobjective analysis and consideration of the facts, but to feed the frenzy and substitute Ms.\nMaxwell for Epstein.\n\nThus, the government announced its arrest and indictment of Ms. Maxwell on July 2,\n2o2o, the exact anniversary of Epstein’s indictment. At an extraordinary press conference, the\nUnited States Atorney for this District described Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution as the “prequel” to\nthe Epstein indictment; thereafter, the then-Atorney General, in rare public comments on bail\nproceedings in an individual case, expressed his delight that “we were able to get Miss\nMaxwell.”\n\nBut in trying “to get” Ms. Maxwell, the government compromised its standards, cut\ncorners, and exceeded its authority under the law. This is shoun in the present motion and\nothers we are filing today, and includes the follouing:\n\n* The government has pressed forward with this case even though the NPA expressly\nprovides that “the United States .. . will not institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Rather than argue, as it has time and again, that\nsuch agreements should be construed as drafted, the government does the opposite\nhere, retreating from the very agreement that its oun agents negotiated and agreed to\nwith the approval of senior levels of Main Justice.\n\n* The government has concocted a federal Mann Act case against Ms. Maxwell by\nalleging that, on some unspecified occasion during a four-year period between l994\nand l997, and in an unspecified manner, she somehou transported and caused a\nsingle individual to travel across state lines for purposes of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity with Epstein. Those charges, in turn, require the government to allege\na violation of New York law relating to sexual activity.

El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio 2ool). In E/-Sadig, the court held\nthat the defendant, who was alleged to have purchased firearms unlawfully for two members of\nthe Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to\nenforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> any of the\nindividuals involved in the purchase. l33 F.

The court concluded that “even if\nthe non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can\nenforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 6o8. Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement. Jd. at 6o9.\n\nBoth Florida West and El-Sadig illustrate hou the government’s argument that Ms.\nMaxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA is contrary to bedrock principles of contract law, as\napplied to immunity agreements. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants in Florida West and El-\nSadig were not parties to the agreements at issue. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants were not\nspecifically named in the agreements. Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were\nthird-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the\nagreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child.

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6).

(emphasis in\noriginal); see also OPR Report at 8l, n.l25 (observing that a supervisor at the USAO-SDFL\n“pointed out that the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other co-conspirators could have been\nprosecuted ‘by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.’”).\n\nAs the USAO-SDFL has explained, the NPA did not bind other districts, and could not.\n\nThat is because the USAO-SDFL lacked the authority to do so under applicable Department of\nJustice guidelines:\n\nSignificantly, under the governing provision of the United States\n\nAtorney’s Manual, the USAO-SDFL did not have the authority to\n\nunilaterally bar Epstein’s prosecution in any other district in the\n\ncountry: ‘No district or division shall make any agreement,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2974\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4l of 239\n\nincluding any agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, which purports to bind\n\nany other district(s) or division without the express writen approval\n\nof the United States Atorney(s) in each affected district and/or the\n\nAssistant Atorney General of the Criminal Division.’\nGovernment Brief, o8 Civ. 8o736 (KAM), Dkt. No. 2o5-2, at ll n.ll (S.D. Fla.) (quoting United\nStates Atorney’s Manual, 9-27.64l (Multi-District (Global) Agreement Requests)). Significantly,\nthis brief was signed by the same prosecutor who negotiated and signed the NPA. /d. Although\nthe defendant makes the sweeping, self-serving, and unsupported allegation that “the government\nhad every reason to foresee a potential prosecution of Epstein’s co-conspirators in this District\nand, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice, intended to agree to preclude\nit,’ the USAO-SDFL’s brief says otherwise. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Further still, the record\ndeveloped in both civil litigation and OPR’s investigation does not support this claim.\n\n3s 2 3\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant has failed to produce any evidence that the\nUSAO-SDFL promised Epstein that other districts would be bound by the NPA. There is no\n“affirmative appearance” that the NPA binds other districts, and the motion should be denied.\nUnder Annabi and its progeny, the defendant has failed to establish that the NPA binds other\ndistricts. For this reason alone, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed, in keeping with the\nwell-established law in this Circuit.*\n8 In her motion, the defendant asks this Court to apply a bizarre and unprecedented choice-of-\nfederal-law doctrine, under which the defendant asks the Court to apply non-existent rulings from\nthe Eleventh Circuit on an issue that Court does not appear to have reached. (Def. Mot. l at 23-\n25). This argument has no legal foundation, and the defendant offers no authority for the\nproposition that federal plea agreements are governed by the choice of law principles that apply to\nconflicting state laws. Annabi is the binding law of this Circuit, and this Court must apply it.\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 239\nlimitations. As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea\nagreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. l at 3o (citing\nUnited States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (“[W]hile the district court’s analysis\nmight have been compelling with respect to a contract arising out of commercial negotiations\namong private parties, we believe the court did not correctly apply the standards that govern the\ninterpretation of plea agreements with the government. We have long recognized that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l3, l998) (“Even if Santobello could\nestablish the existence of plea agreements between the Government and his co-defendants, there\nis litle knoun authority that would allou him to enforce the agreements as a third party\nbeneficiary.”) (citing United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (lst Cir. l99l)).\n\nFollouing this logic, at least one court has concluded that third parties lack standing to\nenforce plea agreements. In United States v. Mariamma Viju, the defendant claimed that the\nGovernment had entered into a plea agreement with her husband, under which the Government\nhad promised not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> her.

In other words, “the intent of the parties is the key” to evaluating\nwhether an individual is a third party beneficiary. /d.\n\nHere, the defendant has offered no evidence that the parties intended to confer a benefit on\nher in particular, or that her crimes in the l99os make her a member of the class of “co-\nconspirators” the parties had in mind when they negotiated the NPA. To the contrary, the OPR’s\ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of this provision in the NPA strongly\nundercuts any such argument, and OPR’s findings demonstrate that the parties did not intend to\nconfer a benefit on the defendant. With respect to the “co-conspirator” provision, the OPR Report\nconcluded, in relevant part:\n\nOther than various drafts of the NPA and of a federal plea\nagreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous records\nmentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects\ndiscussed or debated it—or even gave it much consideration. Drafts\nof the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou that the final\nbroad language promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein” evolved from a more narrou provision\nsought by the defense. The provision expanded as [USAO-SDFL\nprosecutor Maria] Villafafia and defense counsel exchanged drafts\nof, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the NPA,\nwith apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within\nthe USAO about the Provision.\nOPR Report at l66. With respect to Maxwell in particular, OPR interviewed Maria Villafafia, the\nlead prosecutor on the case, and noted:\nVillafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s\nlongtime relationship with a close female friend who was a well-\nknoun socialite, but, according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t\nhave any specific evidence against her.” Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would\nbenefit from the provision were the four female assistants identified\nby name.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page5/7 of 239\nThe defendant argues that Congress did not intend for Section 3283 to apply to pre-\n\nenactment conduct, and asserts that the legislative history supports this interpretation. Specifically,\nthe defendant points to an earlier version of the bill, which contained an express retroactivity\nprovision that was not included in the final version of the statute. (Def. Mot. 2 at 6-7). The\ndefendant’s argument on this point is both misleading and unpersuasive. The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def. Mot. 2 at 7). This is a selective quotation; the full\nstatement regarding retroactivity is as follous:\n\nA final point on section 2o2: I am pleased that the conference agreed\n\nto drop language from the original House-passed bill that would\n\nhave extended the limitations period retroactively. That language,\n\nwhich would have revived the government’s authority to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\ncrimes that were previously time-barred, is of doubtful\n\nconstitutionality. We are already pushing the constitutional\n\nenvelope with respect to several of the “virtual porn” provisions in\n\nthis bill. I am pleased that we are not doing so in section 2o2 as\n\nwell.\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (emphasis added). As\nthe full quotation makes clear, the legislative history does not support the conclusion that when\nCongress amended Section 3283, it declined to adopt the language in the House-passed bill\nbecause it wanted the lengthened statute of limitations to apply only prospectively. Instead,\nSenator Leahy’s comments indicate that Congress declined to add language that would allou for\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (2ol6 indictment covering conduct going back\nto l998); United State v. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 622 (E.D. Va. 2ol9) (2ol9 indictment for\nconduct in 2ooo).

See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (denying motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay as to conduct charged in 2ol6\ninvolving sexual abuse of minors from l998 to 2oo7 as defendant failed to satisfy both prongs of\npre-indictment delay standard); United States v.

July l, 2oll) (denying motion to dismiss indictment based on thirty-year pre-\nindictment delay because even if unavailability of alibi witnesses were prejudicial, defendant failed\nto shou that government delayed for its oun benefit); United States v. Carbonaro, No. o2 Cr. 743\n(RCC), 2oo4 WL 2222l45 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3o, 2oo4) (in a racketeering conspiracy case in which\na l4-year-old murder was alleged as a predicate act, finding that, even assuming defendant had\nshoun actual prejudice, defendant’s motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay failed\nbecause defendant supplied no evidence that government’s conduct was for an improper purpose).\n\nThe defendant claims that the Government intentionally delayed the indictment in this case\nwith a prescient view touards capitalizing on civil litigation. For instance, Maxwell asserts that it\n“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from\nMs. Maxwell as part of civil discovery and disseminating that information to the public, as part of\nan ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l6). She again cites the subpoena\nthe Government issued to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to obtain materials\nfrom the Giuffre civil litigation. (/d.).

Counsel cites Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6 (l886) for the proposition that “a\ncompulsory production of the private books and papers . . . [also] is compelling . . . him to be a\nwitness against himself, within the meaning of the fifth amendment.” (Det. Mot. ll at l5) (quoting\nBoyd, ll6 U.S. at 634-35).

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 348\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed. Houever, if you all do decide to go forward with\nthese meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then\nI will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in\nagreement with the handling of the case.\n\nAfter receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafafia, “Let’s talk before\nthis is sent, please.”°° Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n5o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 348\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo326l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “TI don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !*4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

[and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo333l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span>\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.”**’ On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?°8\n266 H.

You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial.

February — March 2oo8: Villafatia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 256 of 348\nan instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of\nthe FBI case agents.\n\nEdwards contacted Villafafia by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had\n“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”*** In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that\nduring multiple telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage\nthe investigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because\nthe mater “was an on-going active investigation[.]’” Edwards atested that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”°”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia said that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea:\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the situation — Epstein was still challenging\nour ability to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him federally, pressing allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate beter plea terms,\nwhile the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving touards\n[filing charges] — I did not feel comfortable sharing any information\nabout the case. It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”°°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\nane Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28l of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “‘misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2l, 2ol9).\n\n255\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution\n\nIn September 2oo7, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey\nEpstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the Office of the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to\nplead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. /d. In exchange, the U.S. Atorney’s Office agreed not to charge him\nwith federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his\nconduct between 2ool and 2oo7. /d. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of\nhis “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility\nobserved, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.\nOPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S. Atorney’s\npromise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added “with litle\ndiscussion or consideration by the prosecutors.” Jd. at l69, l85. The report concluded that the\nU.S. Atorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,\nbut nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” Jd. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell\ncontends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of\nJeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal\nlimitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New\nYork. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the Sl superseding indictment.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3677\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of34\nits entirety, reads as follous: “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal\ncharges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt. No. l42-l at 5. Under Annabi,\nSalameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> implies no\nrestriction on prosecutions in other districts.\n\nTwo provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of\nFlorida. The first states that the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer\n“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. l42-l at 2. The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3679\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003690.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.

In\naffirming the district court's decision to dismiss the indictment, the Eleventh Circuit stated:\n\nAlthough the single statements “Record of traffic convictions,” or “Record of other\nconvictions” may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing\nwhen buried in a list headed “Medical History” and purportedly concerned with\nmedical conditions....

Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the\nmotion is “premature,” focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell\nwere convicted on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell atendant to the\novercharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until\n“after the completion of trial” which will “ensure” a full factual record. Resp. at l72.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l2(b)(3)(B)(i), a defendant is required to raise arguments based\non defects in the indictment, including “charging the same offense in more than one count\n(multiplicity),” by pretrial motion “if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\ndefect by requiring the government to elect which of the conspiracy charges it will move forward\nwith and dismiss the remaining conspiracy charge.\n\nII. The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged\n\nConspiracies Are Distinct.\n\nTo guard against the “well recognized danger” that prosecutors can easily “draft\nindictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an\noverall conspiracy,” where a defendant “makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in\nfact charge only one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies.” United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (citing United States v.

It would\nalso be entirely unjust to base a prosecution in this District on the same offenses related to the\nsame accuser who never mentioned Ms. Maxwell—and instead implicated a vben\nshe first reported the allegations that form the basis of Counts Five and Six over thirteen years\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 32\nagreement bind the Western District of Pennsylvania and bar it from charging the same offenses\nin a subsequent prosecution?

Here, the co-conspirator provision of the NPA provides that if Epstein\nabides by the terms of the agreement, “the United States” will not institute any criminal charges\n“against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” which immunizes Ms. Maxwell for the\noffenses covered by the NPA. (Ex. B at 5 of 7; see also Dkt. 2o7 at 7). As set forth above,\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are based on the same alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-4 from 2ool-2oo4 that was presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for\nseveral overt acts of a conspiracy charge and a substantive sex trafficking offense against Epstein\nin the proposed SDFL indictment. The prosecution of those offenses was abandoned as part of\nthe bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4\nbenefited. In sum, the USAO-SDNY is trying to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Ms. Maxwell in Counts Five and Six\nfor the identical charges that were resolved by the NPA. In these circumstances, Annabi and its\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293_ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o of 32\nprogeny do not control.* The Court should instead follou Gebbie and find that NPA precludes\nthe USAO-SDNY from charging Counts Five and Six.\n\nThis result is consistent with the terms and the drafting history of the NPA. As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).\nHence, these provisions of the NPA reflect Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not become\nembroiled in subsequent prosecutions of his “potential co-conspirators” in any other districts.\n(Dkt. 223 at ll).\n\nMoreover, this result is consistent with fundamental fairness. Allouing a federal district\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a defendant for an offense that is identical to one that was already resolved as part of\n® For the same reasons, the Court is not bound by subsequent Second Circuit decisions interpreting Annabi, which\nhave found that the use of phrases like “the United States” or “the government” in a plea agreement does not create\nan “affirmative appearance” to bind other districts.

Prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six Would Violate Her Rights Under\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\nProsecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six would also violate her rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall “be subject\nfor the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const., Amend. V. The\nClause protects criminal defendants against “a second prosecution for the same offense after\nacquital,” “a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,” and “multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v.

The Supreme Court first established the principle that\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense almost\nl5o years ago in Ex Parte Lange, 85 U.S. (l8 Wall.) l63 (l873), and it is equally important as\nthe protection against a successive prosecution for the same offense.\n\nIf there is anything setled in the jurisprudence of England and\nAmerica, it is that no man can be twice lawfully punished for the\nsame offence. And ... there has never been any doubt of (this\nrule’s) entire and complete protection of the party when a second\npunishment is proposed in the same court, on the same facts, for\nthe same statutory offense.\n\n...

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 59 of 349\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\namicably work out a light sentence.”\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed. Houever, if you all do decide to go forward with\nthese meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then\nI will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in\nagreement with the handling of the case.\n\nAfter receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafafia, “Let’s talk before\nthis is sent, please.”°° Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n5o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 86 of 349\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he understood\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 96 of 349\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo2 of 349\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo7 of 349\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !74\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “TI bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater.

And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement.

The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l47 of 349\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5o of 349\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l62 of 349\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span>\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l66 of 349\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9o of 349\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l93 of 349\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l9 of 349\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the nghts included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such nghts\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the nights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:*©°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nIl.

On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H.

Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.

Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo455l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 257 of 349\nan instance in which Wild “asked a question that wasn’t answered” of anyone in the USAO or of\nthe FBI case agents.\n\nEdwards contacted Villafafia by email and telephone in mid-June, stating that he had\n“information and concerns that [he] would like to share.”*** In his affidavit, Edwards alleged that\nduring multiple telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage\nthe investigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because\nthe mater “was an on-going active investigation[.]” Edwards atested that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and [in] complexity.”*”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia said that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring these interactions with Edwards, which occurred before the state court plea:\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the situation — Epstein was still challenging\nour ability to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him federally, pressing allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct, and trying to negotiate beter plea terms,\nwhile the agents, my supervisors, and I were all moving touards\n[filing charges] — I did not feel comfortable sharing any information\nabout the case. It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\noe Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27o of 349\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 282 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2l, 2ol9).\n\n255\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3 of 8o\nevidence upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident\ncould be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”'\n\nSeeking “some measure of justice” for Constand, D.A. Castor decided that the\nCommonwealth would decline to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby for the incident involving Constand,\nthereby allouing Cosby to be forced to testify in a subsequent civil action, under penalty\nof perjury, without the benefit of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination .2\nUnable to invoke any right not to testify in the civil proceedings, Cosby relied upon the\ndistrict atorney's declination and proceeded to provide four sworn depositions. During\nthose depositions, Cosby made several incriminating statements.\n\nD.A. Castor’s successors did not feel bound by his decision, and decided to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby notwithstanding that prior undertaking. The fruits of Cosby’s reliance\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision—Cosby’s sworn inculpatory testimony—were then used by\nD.A. Castor’s successors against Cosby at Cosby’s criminal trial. We granted allouance\nof appeal to determine whether D.A. Castor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby in\nexchange for his testimony must be enforced against the Commonwealth.®\n\n|. Factual and Procedural History\n\nIn the fall of 2oo2, Constand, a Canadian-born former professional basketball\nplayer, was employed as the Director of Basketball Operations at Temple University. It\nwas in this capacity that Constand first met Cosby, who had close ties to, and was heavily\ni Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”), Habeas Corpus Hearing, 2/2/2ol6, at 6o.\n\n2 Id. at 63.\n\n3 As we discuss in more detail belou, at Cosby’s trial, the trial court permited the\nCommonwealth to call five witnesses who testified that Cosby had engaged in similar\nsexually abusive paterns with each of them. We granted allouance of appeal here as\nwell to consider the admissibility of that prior bad act evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 4o4(b).\nHouever, because our decision on the Castor declination issue disposes of this appeal,\nwe do not address the Rule 4o4(b) claim.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A. Castor to conclude\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge\nagainst [] Cosby related to the Constand incident could be proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 6o.\n\nHaving determined that a criminal trial likely could not be won, D.A. Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, Cosby would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to\ninvoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for fear that his statements\ncould later be used against him by the Commonwealth. Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can't\n\nsubpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something\n\nillegat—or evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did\n\nsomething illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to\n\nsanctions because you’re under subpoena.\n\nSo the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |\n\ndid in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby\n\nwould not be prosecuted no mater what. As a mater of law, that then made\n\nit so that he could not take the Fifth Amendment ever as a mater of law.\n\nSo | have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term\n\n“agreement,” but everybody has used the wrong word. | told [Cosby’s\n\natorney at the time, Walter] Phillips that | had decided that, because of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 8o\ndefects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to\n\nmake a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.\n\n| told him that | was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not\n\nbe alloued to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that\n\nAndrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of\n\nPennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was\n\nsubpoenaed, he would be required to testify.\n\nBut those two things were not connected one to the other. Mr. Cosby was\n\nnot geting prosecuted at all ever as far as | was concerned. And my belief\n\nwas that, as the Commonwealth and the representative of the sovereign,\n\nthat | had the pouer to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a\n\nmater of law Mr. Cosby would be unable to assert the Fifth Amendment in\n\na civil deposition.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than me—and\n\n| had 2o years on the job by that point—agreed with my legal assessment.\n\nAnd he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were\n\nrepresenting Mr. Cosby in the pending civil suit.\n\nId. at 64-66. Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district atorney further\nemphasized that it was “absolutely” his intent to remove “for all time” the possibility of\nprosecution, because “the ability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.”\nId. at 67.\n\nConsistent with his discussion with Atorney Phillips, D.A. Castor issued another\npress release, this time informing the public that he had decided not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby.\nThe press release stated, in full:\n\nMontgomery County District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. has announced\n\nthat a joint investigation by his office and the Cheltenham Tounship Police\n\nDepartment into allegations against actor and comic Bill Cosby is\n\nconcluded. Cosby maintains a residence in Cheltenham Tounship,\n\nMontgomery County.\n\nA 3l year old female, a former employee of the Athletic Department of\n\nTemple University complained to detectives that Cosby touched her\n\ninappropriately during a visit to his home in January of 2oo4. The woman\n\nreported the allegation to police in her native Canada on January l3, 2oo5.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 8o\nphone calls were being recorded. Although he did not believe that Constand was making\nthese allegations in an atempt to get money from him, Cosby explained that, after\nConstand and her mother confronted him, he offered to pay for her education and asked\nhis atorney to commence discussions regarding seting up a trust for that purpose.\nCosby admited that it would be in his best interests if the public believed that Constand\nhad consented to the encounter, and that he believed he would suffer financial\nconsequences if the public believed that he had drugged and assaulted her.\n\nNotably, during his depositions, Cosby confessed that, in the past, he had provided\nQualudes®*—not Benadrylto other women with whom he wanted to have sexual\nintercourse.\n\nEventually, Constand setled her civil suit with Cosby for $3.38 million.’ Initially,\nthe terms of the setlement and the records of the case, including Cosby’s depositions,\nwere sealed. Houever, follouing a media request, the federal judge who presided over\nthe civil suit unsealed the records in 2ol5.\n\nBy that point, then-D.A.

He was succeeded as district\natorney by his former first assistant, Risa Vetri Ferman, Esquire.‘° Despite her\npredecessor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby, upon release of the civil records, District\nAtorney Ferman reopened the criminal investigation of Constand’s allegations.

Castor sent her an email, to which he atached his February l7, 2oo5 press\nrelease, stating the follouing:\n\nDear Risa,\n\n| certainly knou beter than to believe what | read in the newspaper, and |\n\nhave witnessed first hand your legal acumen. So you almost certainly knou\n\nthis already. |’m writing to you just in case you might have forgoten what\n\nwe did with Cosby back in 2oo5. Atached is my opinion from then.\n\nOnce we decided that the chances of prevailing in a criminal case were too\n\nremote to make an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve justice\n\nwas to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would have the best chance\n\nof prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby. With the agreement of [Atorney]\n\nPhillips and [Constand’s] lawyers, | wrote the atached as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending. Again, with the\n\nagreement of the defense lawyer and [Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally\n\nand specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\n\nprosecution of Cosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his\n\nFifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing him to\n\nsit for a deposition under oath. [Atorney Phillips] was speaking for Cosby’s\n\nside at the time, but he was in contact with Cosby’s civil lawyers who did\n\nnot deal with me directly that | recall. | only discovered today that [Atorney\n\nPhillips] had died. But those lawyers representing [Constand] civilly, whose\n\nnames | did not remember until | saw them in recent media accounts, were\n\npart of this agreement because they wanted to make Cosby testify. |\n\nbelieved at the time that they thought making him testify would solidify their\n\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the Commonwealth) to\n\npromise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him. So in effect, that is what | did. | never made\n\nan important decision without discussing it with you during your tenure as\n\nFirst Assistant.\n\nKnouing the above, | can see no possibility that Cosby’s deposition could\n\nbe used in a state criminal case, because | would have to testify as to what\n\nhappened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression. | cannot\n\" Mr. Steele has since been elected District Atorney of Montgomery County.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 8o\nbelieve any state judge would allou that deposition into evidence, nor\nanything derived therefrom. In fact, that was the specific intent of all parties\ninvolved including the Commonwealth and the plaintiff's lawyers. Knouing\nthis, unless you can make out a case without that deposition and without\nanything the deposition led you to, | think Cosby would have an action\nagainst the County and maybe even against you personally. That is why |\nhave publically suggested looking for lies in the deposition as an alternative\nnou that we have learned of all these other victims we did not knou about\nat the time we had made the go, no-go decision on arresting Cosby. |\npublically suggested that the DA in California might try a common plan\nscheme or design case using [Constand’s] case as part of the res gestae in\ntheir case. Because | knew Montgomery County could not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby\nfor a sexual offense, if the deposition was needed to do so. But | thought\nthe DA in California might have a shot because | would not have the pouer\nto bind another state’s prosecutor.\n\nSome of this, of course, is my opinion and using Cosby’s deposition in the\n\nCA case, might be a stretch, but one thing is fact: the Commonwealth,\n\ndefense, and civil plaintiffs lawyers were all in the agreement that the\n\natached decision from me stripped Cosby of this Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination, forcing him to be deposed. That led to Cosby\npaying [Constand] a lot of money, a large percentage of which went to her\nlawyers on a contingent fee basis. In my opinion, those facts will render\n\nCosby’s deposition inadmissible in any prosecution in Montgomery County\n\nfor the incident that occurred in January 2oo4 in Cheltenham Tounship.\n\nBruce\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5.\n\nReplying by leter, D.A. Ferman asserted that, despite the public press release,\nthis was the first she had learned about a binding understanding between the\nCommonwealth and Cosby. She requested a copy of any writen agreement not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. D.A. Castor replied with the follouing email:\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that we would not\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. That was what the lawyers for [Constand] wanted and |\n\nagreed. The reason | agreed and the plaintiffs lawyers wanted it in writing\n\nis so that Cosby could not take the 5th Amendment to avoid being deposed\n\nor testifying. A sound strategy to employ. That meant to all involved,\n\nincluding Cosby’s lawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in\n\nthe civil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution for\n\nthe event we had him under investigation for in early 2oo5. | signed the\n\npress release for precisely this reason, at the request of [Constand’s]\n\ncounsel, and with the acquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 8o\ncomplete intent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in the\n\ncivil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing him to be deposed\n\nand perhaps testify in a civil trial without him having the ability to “take the\n\n5th” | decided to create the best possible environment for [Constand] to\n\nprevail and be compensated. By signing my name as District Atorney and\n\nissuing the atached, | was “signing off’ on the Commonwealth not being\n\nable to use anything Cosby said in the civil case against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution, because | was stating the Commonwealth will not bring a case\n\nagainst Cosby for this incident based upon then-available evidence in order\n\nto help [Constand] prevail in her civil action. Evidently, that strategy worked.\n\nThe atached, which was on leterhead and signed by me as District\n\nAtorney, the concept approved by [Constand’s] lawyers was a “writen\n\ndeclaration” from the Atorney for the Commonwealth there would be no\n\nprosecution based on anything Cosby said in the civil action. Naturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby said, or anything\n\nderived from what Cosby said, | believed then and continue to believe that\n\na prosecution is not precluded.\n\nId., Exh. D-7.\n\nDespite her predecessor’s concerns, D.A. Ferman and the investigators pressed\nforward, reopening the criminal case against Cosby. Members of the prosecutorial team\ntraveled to Canada and met with Constand, asking her to cooperate with their efforts to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby, even though she had specifically agreed not to do so as part of the civil\nsetlement. Investigators also began to identify, locate, and interview other women that\nhad claimed to have been assaulted by Cosby.\n\nNearly a decade after D.A. Castor’s public decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby, the\nCommonwealth charged Cosby with three counts of aggravated indecent assault’?\nstemming from the January 2oo4 incident with Constand in Cosby's Cheltenham\nresidence. On January ll, 2ol6, Cosby filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus‘?\nie By this time, Mr. Steele had replaced Judge Ferman as District Atorney. See l8\nPa.C.S. § 3l25(a)(l), (a)(4), and (a)(5).\n\ni Cosby styled the petition as a “Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and Motion to\nDisqualify the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office.” The trial court treated the\nomnibus motion as three separate motions: (l) a motion to dismiss the charges based\nupon the alleged non-prosecution agreement; (2) a motion to dismiss the charges based\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 8o\nseeking, inter alia, dismissal of the charges based upon the former D.A. Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained.

Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\nCosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\nAmendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ...

The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be prosecuted. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday.

We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email.

[nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity. At no time during the civil suit did Ms. Troiani\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 8o\nreceive any information in discovery or from [Cosby’s] atorneys indicating\nthat [Cosby] could never be prosecuted.\n\nMs. Troiani testified that she understood the press release to say that Mr.\nCastor was not prosecuting at that time but if additional information arose,\nhe would change his mind. She did not take the language, “District Atorney\nCastor cautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision\nshould the need arise,” to be a threat not to speak publicly. She continued\nto speak to the press; Mr. Castor did not retaliate.\nMs. Troiani was present for [Cosby’s] depositions. At no point during the\ndepositions was there any mention of an agreement or promise not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. In her experience, such a promise would have been put on the\nrecord at the civil depositions. She testified that during the four days of\ndepositions, [Cosby] was not cooperative and the depositions were\nextremely contentious. Ms. Troiani had to file motions to compel [Cosby’s]\nanswers. [Cosby’s] refusal to answer questions related to Ms. Constand’s\nallegations formed the basis of a motion to compel. When Ms. Troiani\natempted to question [Cosby] about the allegations, [Cosby’s] atorneys\nsought to have his statement to police read into the record in lieu of cross\nexamination.\nMs. Troiani testified that one of the initial provisions [Cosby] wanted in the\ncivil setlement was a release from criminal liability. [Cosby’s civil atorney\nPatrick] O’Conner’s leter to Ms. Ferman does not dispute this fact. [Cosby]\nand his atorneys also requested that Ms. Troiani agree to destroy her file,\nshe refused. Eventually, the parties agreed on the language that Ms.\nConstand would not initiate any criminal complaint. The first Ms. Troiani\nheard of a promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> was in 2ol5. The first Ms. Kivitz learned\nof the purported promise was in a 2ol4 newspaper article.\nJohn P. Schmit, Esq., testified that he has represented [Cosby] since l983.\nIn the early l99os, he became [Cosby’s] general counsel. In 2oo5, when\nhe became aware of the instant allegations, he retained criminal counsel,\nWilliam Phillips, Esq., on [Cosby’s] behalf. Mr. Phillips dealt directly with\nthe prosecutor’s office and would then discuss all maters with Mr. Schmit.\n[Cosby’s] January 2oo5 interview took place at Mr. Schmit’s office. Both\nMr. Schmit and Mr. Phillips were present for the interview. Numerous\nquestions were asked the answers to which could lead to criminal charges.\nAt no time during his statement to police did [Cosby] invoke the Fifth\nAmendment or refuse to answer questions. Mr. Schmit testified that he had\ninterviewed [Cosby] prior to his statement and was not concerned about his\nanswers. Within weeks of the interview, the District Atorney declined to\nbring a prosecution. Mr. Schmit testified that Mr. Phillips told him that the\ndecision was an irrevocable commitment that District Atorney Castor was\nnot going to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> [Cosby]. He received a copy of the press release.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 25\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 8o\n\nOn March 8, 2oo5, Ms. Constand filed her civil suit and Mr. Schmit retained\n\nPatrick O’Conner, Esq., as civil counsel. Mr. Schmit participated in the civil\n\ncase. [Cosby] sat for four days of depositions. Mr. Schmit testified that\n\n[Cosby] did not invoke the Fifth Amendment in those depositions and that\n\nhe would not have let him sit for the depositions if he knew the criminal case\n\ncould be reopened.\n\nHe testified that generally he does try to get agreements on [Cosby’s] behalf\n\nin writing. During this time period, Mr. Schmit was involved in writen\n\nnegotiations with the National Enquirer. He testified that he relied on the\n\npress release, Mr. Castor’s word and Mr. Phillips’ assurances that what Mr.\n\nCastor did was sufficient. Mr. Schmit did not personally speak to Mr. Castor\n\nor get the assurance in writing. During the depositions, Mr. O’Conner\n\nobjected to numerous questions. At the time of the depositions, Mr. Schmit,\n\nthrough his negotiations with the National Enquirer, learned that there were\n\nJane Doe witnesses making allegations against [Cosby]. [Cosby] did not\n\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege when asked about these other women.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that he had not formed an opinion as to whether Mr.\n\nCastor’s press release would cover that testimony.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that during negotiations of the setlement agreement\n\nthere were references to a criminal case. The setlement agreement\n\nindicated that Ms. Constand would not initiate a criminal case against Mr.\n\nCosby. Mr. Schmit did not come forward when he learned the District\n\nAtorney’s office re-opened the case in 2ol5.\n\nT.C.O. at 47-6l (cleaned up).\n\nNotably, when District Atorney Castor decided not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby, he\n“absolutely” intended to remove “for all time” the possibility of prosecution, because “the\nability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67.\nThe trial court sought clarification from Mr. Castor about his statement in his second email\nto D.A. Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\nCosby’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of Cosby’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A. Castor stated that what he\nwas “trying to convey to Mrs. Ferman [was that his] binding of the Commonwealth not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby was not for any crime in Montgomery County for all time. It was only\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25. He\ncontinued, “[s]o if they had evidence that some of these other women had been sexually\nassaulted at Cosby’s home in Cheltenham, then | thought they could go ahead with the\nprosecution of that other case with some other victim, so long as they realized they could\nnot use the Constand deposition and anything derived therefrom.” /d.\n\nAs noted, the trial court denied the motion, finding that then-D.A. Castor never, in\nfact, reached an agreement with Cosby, or even promised Cosby that the Commonwealth\nwould not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him for assaulting Constand. T.C.O. at 62. Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 29 of 8o\npermission from a court is a prerequisite to any offer of transactional immunity. See id.\n§ 5947(b) (“The Atorney General or a district atorney may request an immunity order\nfrom any judge of a designated court.”). Because D.A. Castor did not seek such\npermission, and instead acted of his oun volition, the trial court concluded that any\npurported immunity offer was defective, and thus invalid. Consequently, according to the\ntrial court, the “press release, signed or not, was legally insufficient to form the basis of\nan enforceable promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.” T.C.O. at 62.\n\nThe trial court also found that “Mr. Castor’s testimony about what he did and hou\nhe did it was equivocal at best.” /d. at 63. The court deemed the former district atorney's\ncharacterization of his decision-making and intent to be inconsistent, inasmuch as he\ntestified at times that he intended transactional immunity, while asserting at other times\nthat he intended use and derivative-use immunity. The trial court specifically credited\nAtorney Troiani’s statements that she never requested that Cosby be provided with\nimmunity and that she did not specifically agree to any such offer.\n\n(c) Order to testify.--WWhenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in\n\na proceeding specified in subsection (a), and the person presiding at such\n\nproceeding communicates to the witness an immunity order, that witness\n\nmay not refuse to testify based on his privilege against self-incrimination.\n\n(d) Limitation on use.--No testimony or other information compelled under\n\nan immunity order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such\n\ntestimony or other information, may be used against a witness in any\n\ncriminal case, except that such information may be used:\n(l) in a prosecution under l8 Pa.C.S. § 49o2 (relating to perjury) or\nunder l8 Pa.C.S. § 49o3 (relating to false swearing);\n(2) in a contempt proceeding for failure to comply with an immunity\norder; or\n(3) as evidence, where otherwise admissible, in any proceeding\nwhere the witness is not a criminal defendant.\n42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(a)-(d).\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3o of 8o\n\nAs further support for the view that no agreement was reached, nor any promise\nextended, the trial court noted that, in his initial statement to police, which was voluntarily\nprovided and not under oath, Cosby did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since Cosby previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that Cosby subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\nCosby could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d. Specifically, the court noted that Cosby was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay. This Court likewise rejected Cosby’s pre-trial efforts to appeal the\nadverse rulings, denying his petition for allouance of appeal, his petition for review, and\nhis emergency petition for a stay of the proceedings.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 44 of 8o\nuse of the same with the [prior bad acts] witnesses, were essential to resolving the\notherwise he-said-she-said nature of [Constand’s] allegations.” /d. The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, Cosby’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes Cosby's knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up). The court added that any potential for unfair prejudice was\nmitigated substantially by the court’s cautionary instructions, and that, accordingly, there\nwas no error in the admission of this evidence. /d. at 42l.\n\nTurning to Cosby’s claims relating to the enforceability of the non-prosecution or\nimmunity decision rendered by then-District Atorney Castor, the Superior Court viewed\nthis as a challenge to the denial of a motion to quash a criminal complaint, which would\nbe evaluated under an abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 4lo. Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62). Therefore, the court opined, “it is clear on the face of the record that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was no enforceable non-\nprosecution agreement in this case.” /d. The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> [Cosby], only a court order can convey such immunity. Such\npromises exist only as exercises of prosecutorial discretion, and may be revoked at any\ntime.” /d. The court discussed the immunity statute and observed that it provides that “a\ndistrict atorney may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 46 of 8o\nNational Enquirer on the details of its published interview with Cosby, and that Atorney\nSchmit negotiated a term of the setlement agreement with Constand that required her\nassurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation. Thus, the\nCommonwealth argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that “[i]Jt was not necessary for\nthe trial court to specifically state that it rejected .. . Schmit’s testimony, as it is patently\nobvious that his testimony belies his claim that there was some ‘promise’ from [Mr.] Castor\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.” /d. (quoting Commonwealth’s Superior Court Brief at l36-37). The\nSuperior Court agreed that “the evidence was entirely inconsistent with [Cosby's] alleged\nreliance on Mr. Castor’s promise in choosing not to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege\nin the civil suit.” /d. at 4l3-l4.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s claim that the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his deposition testimony due to the immunity that he\npurportedly should have enjoyed. The court opined that Cosby’s suppression argument\nwas “contingent upon his claim that Mr. Castor unilaterally immunized [Cosby] from\ncriminal prosecution, which we have already rejected.” /d. at 4l4. The panel\ndistinguished all of the precedents upon which Cosby relied, including this Court’s\ndecision in Commonwealth v. Stipetich, 652 A.2d l294 (Pa. l995).\n\nIn Stipetich, Pitsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich\nthat, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no\ncharges would be filed against them.

Analysis\n\nWe begin with Cosby’s second listed issue, because, if he is correct that the\nCommonwealth was precluded from prosecuting him, then the question of whether the\nprior bad act testimony satisfied Rule 4o4(b) will become moot.\n\nOn February l7, 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor announced to the public, on\nbehalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that he would not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby for any\noffense related to the 2oo4 sexual abuse that Constand alleged. Constand’s potential\n2o In his petition, Cosby also sought this Court’s review of his claim of improper juror\nbias and his challenge to the constitutionality of SORNA. We denied allocatur as to those\ntwo claims.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 49 of 8o\ncredibility issues, and the absence of direct or corroborative proof by which to substantiate\nher claim, led the district atorney to believe that the case presented “insufficient, credible,\nand admissible evidence upon which any charge could be sustained beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” Press Release, 2/l7/2oo5 (cleaned up). Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle\nthat, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5o of 8o\nlaw, .. . appellate courts have the pouer to draw their oun inferences and make their oun\ndeductions and conclusions.” /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d 626, 63l (Pa. l96o) (citations\nomited).\n\nHere, the trial court presided over the habeas corpus hearing, viewing and hearing\nthe witnesses and their testimonies first-hand. From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A. Castor and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5l of 8o\nCosby was not a formal atempt to bestou transactional immunity upon Cosby is\nsupported by the record.\n\nThe trial court’s description of former D.A. Castor’s testimony as inconsistent and\nequivocal finds support in the record as well. At times, the former district atorney was\nemphatic that he intended his decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby to bind the Commonwealth\npermanently, provided no substantive changes occurred in the case, such as Cosby\nconfessing to the alleged crimes or proof appearing that Cosby had lied to, or atempted\nto deceive, the investigators. In addition to the unconditional nature of the press release,\nformer D.A. Castor told then-District Atorney Ferman in his first email to her that he\n“intentionally and specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state\nprosecution.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, Mr. Castor\nasserted that, by “signing off on the press release, he was “stating that the\nCommonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for this incident based upon then-\navailable evidence.” /d., Exh. D-7.\n\nFurther indicative of his intent to forever preclude prosecution of Cosby for the\n2oo4 incident, former D.A. Castor testified that the signed press release was meant to\nserve as proof for a future civil judge that Cosby would not be prosecuted, thus stripping\nCosby of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Mr. Castor emphasized that his decision\nwas “absolute that [Cosby] never would be prosecuted.” T.C.O. at 52. The former district\natorney stressed that his intent was to “absolutely” remove “for all time” the prospect of\na prosecution, because, in his view, only a steadfast guarantee would permanently strip\nCosby of his right to invoke the Fifth Amendment. N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67. Mr. Castor also\nexpounded upon the purpose of his emails to D.A. Ferman, which he claimed were an\natempt to inform her that, while he bound the Commonwealth with regard to the 2oo4\nincident, she was free to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby for any other crimes that she might uncover.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 53 of 8o\n\nFor the reasons detailed belou, we hold that, when a prosecutor makes an\nunconditional promise of non-prosecution, and when the defendant relies upon that\nguarantee to the detriment of his constitutional right not to testify, the principle of\nfundamental fairness that undergirds due process of law in our criminal justice system\ndemands that the promise be enforced.\n\nProsecutors are more than mere participants in our criminal justice system. As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 54 of 8o\n\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a case”); Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate\n\ndiscretion to file criminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\nClancy, l92 A.3d at 53 (cleaned up).\n\nAs prosecutors are vested with such “tremendous” discretion and authority, our\nlaw has long recognized the special weight that must be accorded to their assurances.\nFor instance, in the context of statements made during guilty plea negotiations, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has held that, as a mater of constitutional due\nprocess and as compelled by the principle of fundamental fairness, a defendant generally\nis entitled to the benefit of assurances made by the prosecutor. See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43. The prosecutor also agreed to consent to a\nrequest that Zuber’s sentence be served concurrently with “back time” that Zuber was\nrequired to serve for a parole violation. /d. at443. The prosecutor stated the terms of the\nagreement on the record, and the trial court accepted the terms of Zuber’s guilty plea and\nol In Santobello, the Supreme Court of the United States did not state explicitly that\nit was premising its holding on due process guarantees. Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a constitutional basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater. See Santobello, 4o4\nU.S., at 266-67 (Douglas, J. concurring).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 59 of 8o\n\nThere is no doubt that promises made during plea negotiations or as part of fully\nconsummated plea agreements differ in kind from the unilateral discretion exercised when\na prosecutor declines to pursue criminal charges against a defendant. As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process. See\nCommonwealth v. Sims, 9l9 A.2d 93l, 94l n.6 (Pa. 2oo7) (noting that federal and state\ndue process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively). We have\nexplained that review of a due process claim “entails an assessment as to whether the\nchallenged proceeding or conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” Commonwealth v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6l of 8o\n\nAn entirely different situation arises when the decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> is\nunconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it\ninduces the defendant to act in reliance thereupon. When a non-prosecution decision is\nconveyed in such a way, and when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,\ndetrimentally relies upon that decision, due process may warrant preclusion of the\nprosecution. Numerous state and federal courts have found that a defendant's\ndetrimental reliance upon the government's assurances during the plea bargaining phase\nboth implicates his due process rights and entitles him to enforcement even of\nunconsummated agreements. The cases are legion.*°\nae See, e.g., State v. Francis, 424 P.3d l56, l6o (Utah 2ol7) (holding that, “[W]hen a\ndefendant has reasonably and detrimentally relied on a plea agreement, the State should\nnot be able to withdraw a plea agreement just because it has not yet been presented to\nthe district court”); State v. Johnson, 36o S.W.3d lo4, ll5 (Ark. 2olo) (holding that, “when\nthe State has entered into an agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> with a prospective defendant\nand the defendant has performed and acted to his detriment or prejudice in reliance upon\nthat agreement, the government must be required to honor such an agreement.”); People\nv.

Streebing, 987 F.2d 368, 372-73 (6th Cir. l993) (holding\nthat the defendant had to demonstrate, inter alia, that he had relied upon the\ngovernment’s promise to his detriment before the promise would be enforceable); United\nStates v.

There has been considerable debate over the\nlegal significance of District Atorney Castor’s publicly announced decision not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby in 2oo5. Before the trial court, the Superior Court, and nou this Court,\nthe parties have vigorously disputed whether D.A. Castor and Cosby reached a binding\nagreement, whether D.A. Castor extended an enforceable promise, or whether any act of\nlegal significance occurred at all. There is testimony in the record that could support any\nof these conclusions. The trial court—the entity charged with sorting through those\nfacts—found that D.A. Castor made no agreement or overt promise.\n\nMuch of that debate, and the atendant factual conclusions, were based upon the\napparent absence of a formal agreement and former D.A. Castor’s various efforts to\ndefend and explain his actions ten years after the fact. As a reviewing court, we accept\nthe trial court’s conclusion that the district atorney's decision was merely an exercise of\nhis charging discretion.24 As we assess whether that decision, and the surrounding\nmA The dissent agrees—as do we —with the trial court’s conclusion that D.A. Castor’s\ndecision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> was, at its core, an exercise of the inherent charging discretion\nvested in district atorneys. See D.O. at l. But the dissent would simply end the analysis\nthere. In the dissent’s view, once a decision is deemed to fall within a prosecutor’s\ndiscretion, that decision “in no way” can bind the actions of future elected prosecutors.\nRespectfully, this perspective overlooks the verity that not all decisions are the same. As\nto routine discretionary decisions, the dissent may be correct. But as we explain\nthroughout this opinion, what occurred here was anything but routine. Here, D.A. Castor’s\nexercise of discretion was made deliberately to induce the deprivation of a fundamental\nright. The typical decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, or not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, is not made for the purpose\nof extracting incriminating information from a suspect when there exists no other\nmechanism to do so.\n\nThe dissent would amalgamate and confine all “present exercise[s] of prosecutorial\ndiscretion” within a single, non-binding, unenforceable, and unreviewable category. /d.\nWe decline to endorse this blanket approach, as such decisions merit, and indeed require,\nindividualized evaluation. To rule otherwise would authorize, if not encourage,\nprosecutors to choose temporarily not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, obtain incriminating evidence from\nthe suspect, and then reverse course with impunity. Due process necessarily requires\nthat court officials, particularly prosecutors, be held to a higher standard. This is\nparticularly so in circumstances where the prosecutor’s decision is crafted specifically to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\ncircumstances, implicated Cosby’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-4. The trial court’s narrou interpretation of\ninduce a defendant to forfeit a constitutional right, and where the defendant has relied\nupon that decision to his detriment. The dissent’s approach would turn a blind eye to the\nreality of such inducements. Due process does not.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 64 of 8o\n“this decision” is possible only when this sentence is read in isolation.2° The court ignored\nwhat came before and after, omiting all relevant and necessary context. The entire\npassage reads as follous:\n\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\n\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\n\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint potential jurors.\n\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\n\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\n\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\n\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\n\nthe need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by\n\nothers) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flatering\n\nlight. The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 65 of 8o\n\nWhen we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A. Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend. V. The right to refuse to incriminate oneself is an “essential mainstay” of our\nconstitutional system of criminal justice. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. l, 7 (l964). The\nprivilege constitutes an essential restraint upon the pouer of the government, and stands\nas an indispensable rampart between that government and the governed. The Fifth\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 69 of 8o\n\nWe already have determined that Cosby in fact relied upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\nWe nou conclude that Cosby’s reliance was reasonable, and that it also was reasonable\nfor D.A. Castor to expect Cosby to so rely. The record establishes without contradiction\nthat depriving Cosby of his Fifth Amendment right was D.A. Castor’s intended result.2’\nHis actions were specifically designed to that end. The former district atorney may have\nequivocated or contradicted himself years later with regard to hou he endeavored to\nachieve that result, but there has never been any question as to what he intended to\nachieve. There can be no doubt that, by choosing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby and then\n27 The dissent asserts that we have predicated our decision upon the existence of an\n“unwriten promise,” which was rejected by the trial court’s credibility findings. D.O. at 3.\nTo the contrary. As we explained earlier, we have accepted the trial court’s findings in\nthis regard, and those findings, which are supported by the record, are binding on this\nCourt. See, supra, page 48 (citing O’Rourke, 778 A.2d at ll99 (Pa. 2ool)). Houever,\nour deference is limited to the factual findings only; we may draw our oun inferences\ntherefrom and reach our oun legal conclusions. See /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d at 63l.\nThus, the trial court’s factual finding that no formal bargained-for-exchange, writen or\nunwriten, occurred does not constrain our legal analysis, nor does it in any way serve to\nimmunize D.A. Castor’s actions from constitutional scrutiny. That there was no formal\npromise does not mean that Cosby no longer had due process rights.\n\nThe trial court’s credibility finding regarding the existence vel non of a particular\npromise does not allou us to ignore the remainder of the overwhelming evidence of\nrecord. The record firmly establishes that D.A. Castor’s desired result was to strip Cosby\nof his Fifth Amendment rights. This patent and developed fact stands separate and apart\nfrom the trial court’s finding that D.A. Castor never extended a formal promise.\n\nThe dissent would ignore the undeniable reality that Cosby relied to his detriment\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision. The dissent does so by shifting the perspective from D.A.\nCastor’s actions to Cosby’s, focusing in particular upon the fact that Cosby did not record\nthe purported agreement or reduce it to writing. As we note in this opinion, in this context,\nneither a promise, nor an agreement, nor a contract, nor evidence of reliance derives\nlegal validity only upon being recorded or upon writen materialization. The law knous no\nsuch prerequisite, and Cosby cannot be punished for failing to comply with a legal\nrequirement that does not exist. The proof of Cosby’s reliance is plain on the face of the\nrecord. It is the fact that, upon the advice and assistance of counsel, Cosby sat for four\ndepositions and incriminated himself, obviously a decision made after and in direct\nreliance upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv. Mebane, 58 A.3d l243 (Pa. Super. 2ol2) (upholding trial court ruling that fundamental\n28 See Khan v.

This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process. See Roue, 676 F.2d at 528 (explaining that, when\na promise induces a defendant to waive his Fifth Amendment rights by testifying or\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\nCosby’s deposition testimony will remedy his constitutional harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A. Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, exclusion of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 79 of 8o\nconstitutional right, was compelled to participate in a civil case after losing that right,\ntestified against his oun interests, weakened his position there and ultimately setled the\ncase for a large sum of money, was tried twice in criminal court, was convicted, and has\nserved several years in prison. All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

As\nwith the other in /imine requests, this evidence will need to be evaluated on a question by\nquestion basis and it is premature to issue blanket rulings as requested by the government.\n\nThis case poses multi-jurisdictional issues that invite various defenses. The government\nhas elected to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case. The government has manipulated federal\nstatutes to fit alleged conduct that is not normally prosecuted federally and seeks to preclude\ndefenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make\nargument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.\n\nVI. UNFOUNDED REQUEST TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts.

And the Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision stated in an interview with the Office of Professional\nResponsibility that she “played no role” in the NPA, either by\nreviewing or approving the agreement.\n\nThe history of the Office of the United States Atorney is instructive\nas to the scope of their actions and duties. The Judiciary Act of l789\ncreated the Office of the United States Atorney, along with the office\nof the Atorney General. More specifically, the Judiciary Act provided\nfor the appointment, in each district, of a “person learned in the law to\nact as atorney for the United States in such district, who shall be sworn\nor affirmed to the faithful execution of his office, whose duty it shall\nbe to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences,\ncognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil\nactions in which the United States shall be concerned.” '° The Judiciary\nAct thus emphasized that U.S. Atorneys would enforce the law of the\nUnited States but did not determine that the actions of one U.S.\nAtorney could bind other districts, let alone the entire nation. In fact,\nthe phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of\n5 United States Atorney’s Manual § 9-27.64l (2oo7).\n'6 An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 2o, § 35, l Stat. 73, 92-93\n(l789) (emphasis added).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool4862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014863.jpg": "CaseGa26-22oo83o-PAEImdDobdwaheentl78o2l2 o Ail ah 327o2) 2A ag Page LS of 26\nthe actions and the duties of the U.S. Atorneys would be limited to\ntheir oun districts, absent any express exceptions.\n\nSince l789, while the number of federal districts has groun\nsignificantly, the duties of a U.S. Atorney and their scope remain\nlargely unchanged. By statute, U.S. Atorneys, “within [their] district,\nshall (l) <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for all offenses against the United States; (2)\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or\nproceedings in which the United States is concerned.” Again, the\nscope of the duties of a U.S. Atorney is cabined to their specific district\nunless otherwise directed.'®\n\nIn short, Annabi controls the result here. Nothing in the text of\n\nthe NPA or its negotiation history suggests that the NPA precluded\nUSAO-SDNY from prosecuting Maxwell for the charges in the\n7 28 U.S.C. § 547.\n'8 This does not suggest that there are no instances in which a U.S. Atorney’s pouers do not\nextend beyond their districts. For instance, under 28 U.S.C. §5l5 a U.S. Atorney can\nrepresent the Government or participate in proceedings in other districts, but only when\nspecifically directed by the Atorney General:\n\nThe Atorney General or any other officer of the Department of Justice, or any\n\natorney specially appointed by the Atorney General under law, may, when\nspecifically directed by the Atorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding\n\n... which United States atorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not\n\nhe is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oool4863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l82 of 267 22lo\nLCAVMAX6 A.

The\nsecond states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against\nEpstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends\nthat the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any\ngeographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly\nlimited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively\napparent”, Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the\nagreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators\nwithout clearly so saying.\n\nWithout an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation\nhistory. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA\nbetween the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA\nfrom the Office of the Deputy Atorney General and communicated with atorneys in other\ndistricts. Any involvement of atorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have\nbeen minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020774.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel56 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020775.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5/7 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.

This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021118.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/l of ll3\n\nAlthough the District Court was correct to recognize that Congress deleted\nthe retroactivity provision purposefully, it failed to understand the reason.

The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nIs Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\ni As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021232.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey a ae 3536o38, Page6o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 348\nopposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case\nas a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as\na white collar or public corruption case where the parties can\n\namicably work out a light sentence.*?\n\nWith respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,\nthose were already raised in his leter (which is part of the indictment\npackage) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed. Houever, if you all do decide to go forward with\nthese meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then\nI will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in\nagreement with the handling of the case.\n\nAfter receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafafia, “Let’s talk before\nthis is sent, please.”°? Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\nag In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n%o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°? During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”??\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl, Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.°* On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n% In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na4 Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n95 Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021269.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOS 3536o38, Page97 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.'!” At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[glood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021280.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo6 3536o38, Pagelo8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so ’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [Pll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.’\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. l”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in aplea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl3 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\na Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021298.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel26 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7— the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !**\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021323.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l49 3536o38, Pagel5l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°?

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).!°> Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nlm The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021334.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6o. 3536o38, Pagel62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021335.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel63 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span>\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021339.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AGS 3536o38, Pagel67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021363.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l89 | 3536o38, Pagel9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafaia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaia, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations.

Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021366.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to <span class=\"highlight\">Prosecute</span> “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said... what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others.

On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\n<span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H.

Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\na8 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[nJothing was provided.”\na Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, {lol (June 6, 2ol7).\n23o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021445.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 569 3536o39, Pagel5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021457.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page27 of 2l7\nSA-28l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28l of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat ‘“[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”3?°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\nane Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2l, 2ol9).\n\n255\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021458.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page28 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*”\n\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings.

Here, Maxwell has failed to\nmake the requisite shouing: she is not named in the\nprovision naming four potential co-conspirator\n(A.l78), and she has offered no evidence that the par-\nties to the NPA intended to confer a benefit on her spe-\ncifically.

The agreement was\nsigned “on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta,\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida.” (A.l75). And in exchange for Epstein’s plea in\nstate court, the USAO-SDFL agreed to defer “prosecu-\ntion in this District’—that is, the Southern District of\nFlorida. (A.l75). The USAO-SDFL further promised\nthat no prosecution by “the Federal Bureau of Investi-\ngation and the U.S. Atorney’s Office ... will be insti-\ntuted in this District.” (A.l75). An agreement by the\nUSAO-SDFL not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida is an agreement intended to apply\nonly to the USAO-SDFL and only in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Florida. Moreover, the agreement was signed\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l678\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021680.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page33 of 93\n2o\nthat “the federal Grand Jury investigation will be sus-\npended.” (A.l78 (emphasis added)). The grand jury in-\nvestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-\nfer in the same agreement (A.l75), and not any poten-\ntial federal grand jury investigations in other districts.\nFurthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United\nStates” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-\nSDFL. For instance, the NPA commits the “United\nStates’—that is, the USAO-SDFL—to providing Ep-\nstein with a list of victims. (A.l77 (‘The United States\nshall provide Epstein’s atorneys with a list of individ-\nuals whom it has identified as victims ....”)). Another\nprovision states that the NPA will not be made part of\nthe public record and commits “the United States’—\nagain, the USAO-SDFL—to providing notice to Ep-\nstein if it receives a Freedom of Information Act re-\nquest requiring disclosure of the agreement. (A.l78).\nThe mere fact that the co-conspirator provision of the\nNPA used the phrase “United States” rather than\n“U.S. Atorney’s Office” is not evidence that the parties\nintended an unusually broad immunity provision. See,\ne.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S.\n5l9, 54o (2ol3) (‘We are not aware, houever, of any\ncanon of interpretation that forbids interpreting differ-\nent words used in different parts of the same statute\nto mean roughly the same thing.”). As Judge Nathan\nconcluded, given the repeated limitations of the com-\nmitments in the NPA to the USAO-SDEL, including\nthe commitment not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Epstein, “[i]t is not\nplausible ... that the parties intended to drastically\nexpand the agreement’s scope in the single sentence on\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l68o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021686.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page39 of 93\n26\n\napproval of each affected U.S. Atorney’s Office before\nentering into any non-prosecution agreement that pur-\nports to bind another district.

(E.g., Br.l8-23). But this Court’s rule is\nsound, as it ensures that a criminal defendant (or\neven, as here, a co-conspirator) will not receive the\nwindfall of immunity that was never intended by the\nparties to the original agreement, while leaving par-\nties free to enter into legitimate multi-district resolu-\ntions if they wish. Nor has Maxwell’s parade of horri-\nbles come to pass in the decades since Annabi was de-\ncided. Furthermore, the same rule has long been ap-\nplied in the Seventh Circuit. See Thompson v. United\nStates, 43l F. App’x 49l, 493 (7th Cir. 2oll); United\nStates v. Rourke, 74 F.3d 8o2, 8o7 n.5 (7th Cir. l996).\nIn any event, this Court need not engage in a point-by-\npoint analysis of the merits of Annabi, because it re-\nmains binding precedent. See United States v. Wilker-\nson, 36l F.3d 7l7, 732 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Court is “bound\nby the decisions of prior panels until such time as they\nare overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court\nor by the Supreme Court’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021689.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page42 of 93\n29\n2.

See l8 U.S.C. § 3282(a). In l99o,\nCongress enacted a provision titled, “Extension of\nChild Statute of Limitations,” which provided that\n“Injo statute of limitation that would otherwise pre-\nclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual\nor physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years\nshall preclude such a prosecution before the child\nreaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of\nl99o, Pub.

XXXIII, § 33ool8(a), lo8 Stat. l796, 2l49\n(codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994)).\n\nWithin a decade, “Congress began to view even the\nextended statute of limitations period in the l994 ver-\nsion of § 3288 as ‘inadequate in many cases’ because it\nreleased from criminal liability sex abusers whose\ncrimes were not brought to the atention of federal au-\nthorities until after their victims turned twenty-five.”\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54 (citing H.R.

Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 amendment,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 amendment ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021696.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page49 of 93\n36\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the limita-\ntions period).\n\nMaxwell notes that Congress “considered—and re-\njected—a retroactivity clause” before enacting the\n2oo3 amendment. (Br.55). But as Judge Nathan recog-\nnized, “the legislative history makes clear that Con-\ngress abandoned the retroactivity provision ... be-\ncause it would have produced unconstitutional re-\nsults.” (A.l52 (discussing co-sponsor remarks express-\ning concern that “the proposed retroactivity provision\nwas ‘of doubtful constitutionality because it ‘would\nhave revived the government’s authority to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>\ncrimes that were previously time-barred’”)).9 Thus,\nthe rejection of the retroactivity clause “shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to\nits constitutional applications, including past conduct\n—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations\nhad not yet expired.” (/d.).\n\n9 Maxwell contests this explanation of the retro-\nactivity clause’s rejection because Stogner v. Califor-\nnia, 5389 U.S. 6o7 (2oo3), had not yet been decided.\n(Br.56-57). But the co-sponsor could hardly have been\nclearer in expressing his constitutional doubts. And\nthe co-sponsor did not need Stogner as a basis for his\nconcern, as courts and Congress have long recognized\nthe distinction between permissible extensions of un-\nexpired statutes of limitations and impermissible ex-\ntensions of expired statutes of limitations.

The Judiciary Act of l789\ncreated the Office of the United States Atorney, along with the office\nof the Atorney General.

The Requested Records Are Not “Material” to Preparing a Defense and Are\nSought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification\n\nAll of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not “material to preparing a defense”\nunder Rule l6, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the\nGovernment’s false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, l4). Thomas is not\nentitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—\nthat would aid in that nullification effort because Rule l6 only entitles a defendant to discovery\nfor purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the\ndecision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span>.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nAn item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is\ndiscoverable under Rule l6(a)(l)(E) only if it “is material to preparing the defense.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(a)(l)(E). “It is [a defendant’s] burden to make a prima facie shouing that documents sought\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense.” United States v.

As noted above, an item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6\n“if it could be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” Stevens, 985 F.2d at\nll8o-8l. The defendant must “offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested\nevidence is material.” Rigas, 258 F.

Moon, 7l8\nF.2d l2lo, l229 (2d Cir. l983). “The discriminatory effect prong requires a shouing that\n‘similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted.’” Alameh, 34l\nF.3d at l73 (quoting Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited; alteration\nincorporated). Where a defendant “has not shoun that the Government prosecuted him because\nof” his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. /d.\n\nIn order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer\n“some evidence tending to shou the existence of the essential elements of the defense.”\nArmstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 5ol F.2d l2o7, l2ll (2d Cir. l974));\nUnited States v.

Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

I have to say in this instance, your\noffice along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not\nadequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and\nprestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He\nlived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the\ncorrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be\nfacing the death penalty. Hou can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of\ngirls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and nou be a free man?! Hou?!! Because he is\nrich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these\ngirls makes me sick. Nou, I understand the pressure of taking on a pouerful person with\nunlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is beter than\nnone can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor\ndid you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your\noffice could have put this monster away for at least 2o years, if not life.\n\nI’m sure you have read Conchita Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this\nmonsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as\na cautionary tale on hou not to <span class=\"highlight\">prosecute</span> a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Nou,\nI do not knou the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, hou much hush’\nmoney was paid out, ect ect. But I do knou that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have\nraped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn’t be alloued to do the\nsame thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you\nlegally could have to put this man in prison. Houever after researching the case, it seems\nyou failed to come doun with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s\noffice and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!\nIt would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the\n\njustice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose\nto defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your litle sister\nor daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American\npeople deserve beter, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the\nanger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the\nwhole DA’s office nee“ to knou this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!\n\n-A Concerned Patriot\n\np.s.
