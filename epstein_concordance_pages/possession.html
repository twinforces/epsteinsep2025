Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus,\nan evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine\nthe terms of an agreement never commited to writing.\nThis is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond\nthe NPA itself, an extensive OPR report details its\nnegotiation history. No record evidence suggests that\nprosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what\nwas spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests\non mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the\ndiscovery on the NPA. In any case, it appears that\nthe Government has already produced two of the\ndocuments Maxwell seeks in her motion—the OPR\nreport and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of\ncourse, the Government’s disclosure obligations would\nrequire it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evi-\ndence or evidence material to preparing the defense,\nincluding any evidence supporting a defense under the\nNPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within\none week whether it views any evidence supporting\nMaxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is\nrequired to disclose, and, if so, whether it has disclosed\nany and all such evidence in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000147.jpg": "84a\nVIII.

Accordingly, although the Court\nconcludes that Maxwell is not entitled to expedite this\ndiscovery based on the arguments in her motion\npapers, the Court will require the parties to confer on\nan overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s repre-\nsentations that it has disclosed all Brady\nand Giglio Material\nThe Supreme Court's decisions in Brady v. Maryland,\n373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S.\nl5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to\ndefendants certain evidence that will aid their defense.\nBrady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence.\nUnder Giglio, the Government has a duty to produce\n“not only exculpatory material, but also information\nthat could be used to impeach a key government\nwitness.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d\nCir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54).

See, e.g., United States v.

The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D.

In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F.

The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

It also explains its decision to deny the government’s\nAmended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order. Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of\nJustice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n§ l5l3(a)(l)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in <span class=\"highlight\">Possession</span> of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(l) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43. Just days\nlater, houever, the devastating extent of the global COVID-l9 pandemic became clear and the\nChief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil\nand criminal jury trials set for the follouing month.

See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. Houever, as the defense\nhas pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him\nabsconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, he does not have any\nconvictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;\nsee also Doc. 274 at 4-5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any\nperson or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s\nconcerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 3 of 3\nstake. And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt.

The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v.

Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 2 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v.

Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v.

Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v.

Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files.

She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight.

All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body.

Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under\nthe age of l8 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an\nelement of the offense.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded as much in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th\nCir. 2oll). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child\npornography. /d. at 8l7-l8. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts\nof the case did involve the sexual abuse of a child, including the production and <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of\nchild pornography. /d. at 8l3-l4. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general\nstatute of limitations, but the offense of production of child pornography did involve sexual\nabuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the\ntime of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing child\npornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., the sexual abuse of a child.” Jd. at\n8l7.\n\nCoutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other\nstatutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a\nparticular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse\nor kidnapping of a child. /d. at 8l7. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of\n§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the\ngovernment would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the\noffense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its\ncharges are not time-barred.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2668", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 22 of 25\nU.S.C. § 3283. Counts One and Two arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), which, at the time of the\nalleged conduct, provided that a person could be charged with a criminal offense if she\n“knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce, or in any Territory or <span class=\"highlight\">Possession</span> of the United States, to engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996) (emphasis added). That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283. A substantive § 2422(a) offense is complete when an individual is\n“nersuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]” to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\nand a conspiracy to commit such an offense is complete when an agreement to “persuade[],\ninduce[], entice[], or coerce[]” an individual to engage in such travel is reached and a single\novert act is commited in furtherance of the agreement. It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2). For all of these reasons,\nCounts One and Two do not charge offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child and thus are not subject to § 3283.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo267o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of 23\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThis Memorandum of Law is submited in support of Ghislaine Maxwell’s Motion for a\nBill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures.’ Specifically, Ms. Maxwell requests:\n\ne a bill of particulars, pursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure;\n\ne disclosure of certain evidence within the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the government or its\n\nwitnesses;\n\ne immediate disclosure of exculpatory material under Brady v.

Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl88 _ Filed o3/29/2l Page3of5\nPage 3\n\nCount Six of the S2 Indictment adds another new charge against the defendant.

Additionally, in order to aid the defense in its trial preparation and review of the discovery,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2869", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl88 _ Filed o3/29/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\ntoday the Government provided the defense with a list of Bates ranges within the discovery\nmaterials produced to date that are particularly relevant to Minor Victim-4. Although that list is\nnot exhaustive and does not include every document that may be relevant to Minor Victim-4, it\nidentifies key pieces of evidence regarding this victim.\n\nAdditionally, in order to ensure that the defense has adequate time to prepare for trial, the\nGovernment intends to begin its production to the defense of non-testifying witness statements by\nApril l2, 2o2l, approximately three months in advance of trial. This production will include the\nstatements of more than 25o witnesses related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and his\nassociates in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> whom the Government does not currently expect to call\nto testify at trial. The Government is continuing to review its files for witness statements and will\nproduce any additional non-testifying witness statements that come to light on a rolling basis as\npromptly as possible in advance of trial.\n\nFinally, given the expanded charges in the S2 Indictment, the Government is prepared to\nproduce Jencks Act and Giglio material for witnesses it expects to call at trial six weeks, rather\nthan four weeks, in advance of trial.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\ndefense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l. As noted in its March 29, 2o2l\nleter to the Court, the Government has already produced to the defense all material of which it is\naware that constitutes Rule l6 discovery related to the new allegations in the S2 Indictment. This\nincludes material that was already in the files of the FBI, which the Government produced during\nits Fall 2o2o productions, and new material obtained during the Government’s investigation, which\nthe Government has produced on a rolling basis as it has received such material. Additionally, the\nGovernment provided the defendant with a list of Bates ranges within the past discovery\nproductions that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4, which should substantially assist the\ndefense in re-reviewing relevant materials and preparing for trial. In other words, this is not a\nsuperseding indictment that requires a huge production of new discovery that the defense will need\ntime to review. To the contrary, the defense already had in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> Rule l6 discovery\nrelevant to the S2 Indictment for months.\n\nThe Government plans to begin producing non-testifying witness statements on April l2,\n2o2l. With these productions, the defense will have access to statements of witnesses whom the\nGovernment does not intend to call at trial, thereby providing the defense multiple months during\nwhich it can decide whether it wishes to call any of these individuals. Further, the Government\nplans to produce Jencks Act and Giglio material for testifying witnesses six weeks in advance of\ntrial, which will provide the defense with far more time than is typical in this District for review\nof such material. Given that the defense has had discovery in this case for months, will have\nmonths with non-testifying witness statements, and will have more than one month with Jencks\nAct and Giglio material, there is every reason to believe that the defense will provide excellent\nrepresentation to the defendant at trial as scheduled beginning July l2, 2o2l.\n\nIn light of the ample time that remains before trial and the steps the Government has\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 239\ncourt resolved the issue by answering a common sense question: “Does someone who merely\npossesses child pornography sexually abuse the child portrayed in the images?” /d. at 8l7. This\ninquiry has no relevance here, as this case does not involve the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child pornography.\n\nThe crimes charged in the Indictment plainly involved the sexual abuse of minors. First,\nthe Indictment clearly alleges that the minor victims were subjected to actual, physical sexual\ncontact as part of the defendant’s crimes. See Indictment at {{ 4 (alleging that conduct touard\nminor victims involved sexual abuse), 5 (alleging that “Epstein’s resulting abuse of minor victims\nincluded, among other things, touching a victim’s breast, touching a victim’s genitals, placing a\nsex toy such as a vibrator on a victim’s genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he\nmasturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein’s genitals.”), 7 (describing paterns of sexual\nabuse). Moreover, the Indictment alleges that the defendant persuaded, induced, enticed, and\ntransported minors for purposes of engaging in criminal sexual activity, and that she conspired to\ndo the same. As discussed above, the offenses charged in the Indictment accordingly involved the\nsexual abuse of minors as defined in Section 35o9(a) and incorporated into Section 3283.\n\nBecause the defendant’s crimes involved sexual abuse, the expanded statute of limitations\nset forth in Section 3283 applies to the crimes charged in Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment and her motion should be denied.\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment Based on Alleged Improper Pre-\n\nTrial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Indictment should be dismissed because the Government’s\ndelay in bringing the charges violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (Def. Mot.\n7). The defendant has not and cannot successfully establish such a violation. First, the defendant\nhas not established that any alleged pre-indictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense.\nHer speculative assertions about lost witnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3oo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 239\n\non which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is that Giuffre or her lawyers would\nnot do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, forward discovery materials in their\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s exception to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d l37, l43 (2d Cir.\n2ol8) (quoting Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 238 (2oll) (internal quotation marks\n\n86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 239\nconsciousness of guilt, such as false exculpatory statements, may also tend to prove knouledge\nand intent of a conspiracy’s purpose ... .” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nSecond, the offenses are logically connected and are part of the same common plan or\nscheme. It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “sufficient logical connection” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel72 of 239\nin each indictment—to his personal profit); United States v. Broun, No. o7-o296, 2oo8 WL\nl6ll46, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Jan. l6, 2oo8) (severing an “isolated” firearms <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> charge on a\ncertain day from other narcotics and firearms charges); United States v. Martinez, No. 92 Cr. 839\n(SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l9, l993) (similar).\n\nThe defendant also contends that her false statements were not connected to the substantive\noffenses because they were made in a civil deposition, rather than “to the grand jury or the FBI to\nderail its investigation.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial mater, and as evidenced by the\ndefendant’s oun motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,\nthe defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal\ninvestigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the\ndistinction is of litle moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law enforcement exception to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l (citing United States v. Carson,\n464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. l972); Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9) (affirming denial of a severance\nmotion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the\nperjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to\nthat analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the seting in which the statement\nis made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (false statement\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l4 of 239\nGovernment has reviewed the full report and confirmed that there is nothing exculpatory contained\ntherein. To the contrary, the report inculpates the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is not\nentitled to its immediate disclosure. The Government will produce an unredacted version of this\ndocument together with all other witness statements in advance of trial.®”\n\nFourth, the defense requests production of pages from a personal diary that is in the custody\nof a civilian third party and is not in the custody or control of the Government. (Def. Mot. lo at\nlo). Leaving aside the fact that the defense cites no authority for the proposition that the\nGovernment has an obligation to obtain the personal papers of a third party, see United States v.\nCollins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“The Government’s ‘Brady obligations extend\nonly to materials within prosecutors’ <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody or control or, in appropriate cases, that\nof the Department of Justice, perhaps another part of the Executive Branch, or a comparable state\nauthority involved in the federal prosecution.’” (quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 3o8 F. Supp.\n3d 736, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8))), the Government has already represented that it has asked the third\nparty at issue about the materials the defendant purports to seek and that no such materials exist.\nIn particular, to the extent the defense is concerned with whether there are diary entries from the\nspring of l996, the Government has already indicated in response to the defendant’s second bail\nmotion that it is aware of none. (See Dkt. No. loo at ll n. 2 (“Because this victim stopped writing\nin her journal about a month after that first meeting with Epstein, there are no entries regarding the\nsubsequent trip she took months later to visit Epstein, during which she met the defendant. This\nvictim provided the Government with copies of her journal entries relating to Epstein and informed.\nthe Government that the remaining entries are personal in nature and have nothing to do with\n®” As is the case with the other redacted document referenced in this motion, the redacted copy\ndefense counsel atached as Exhibit D was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for\none of Epstein’s devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was\nrecovered from the device.\n\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 239\nEpstein or the defendant.”)). In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory\nevidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this\nrepresentation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be\ndenied.\n\nFifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the\nGovernment to produce copies of a// subpoenas it has issued for the defendant’s records as part of\nits investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. lo at ll). This incredibly broad request is nothing more\nthan a fishing expedition inappropriately seeking the details of investigative requests made through\nthe grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government\nto provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other\nmaterials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the\ndefendant’s records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of\nrequests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the\ndefense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable\nmaterial that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In\nthe absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the\nreasons discussed above in Sections I and I'V, the defendant is not entitled to discovery or a hearing\nrelating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress\nsubpoena returns.\n\nSixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any\nBrady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. lo at ll-l3). The motion for disclosure of Brady material\nshould be denied as moot because the Government has conducted a search for any such material\nand has already disclosed any potentially exculpatory information in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of which it is\n\nl88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 239\naware, consistent with the Rule 5(f) Brady order previously issued by the Court in this case. See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> regarding any potential witness identified during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> for\npotential impeachment material. The Government remains cognizant of its Brady obligations and\nwill promptly produce any potentially exculpatory material if any is identified during that review.\n\nThe Government is not currently aware of any undisclosed Brady material in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>,\nbut it will certainly provide timely disclosure of any additional Brady material if any such material\ncomes to light. Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations under Brady. See, e.g.,\nThompson, 2ol3 WL 6246489 at *9 (“In light of the Government's ‘good-faith representation to\nl89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 239\n\nthe court and defense counsel that it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations\nunder Brady,’ defendants’ request for immediate or otherwise early\nproduction of Brady materials is denied.” (internal citation omited) (quoting United States v.\nPerez, 94o F. Supp. 54o, 553 (S.D.N. Y.l996))); Gallo, l999 WL 9848, at *8 (denying defendant’s\nmotion to compel production of purported Brady material based on Government’s representations\nthat “it is aware of its obligations under Brady .. . and will produce any Brady material to the\ndefense well before trial”); United States v. Campo Flores, No. l5 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2ol6 WL\n5946472, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l2, 2ol6) (“The Government represents that it is aware of its\nobligation under Brady; that it has complied; and will continue to comply. That is sufficient to\ndeny Defendants’ motion for Brady relief.” (internal citations omited)). Given the Government’s\nextensive efforts to review its files for any material warranting disclosure, and its commitment to\ncontinue meeting its disclosure obligations, the motion should be denied.\n\nFor similar reasons, the motion for disclosure of Giglio material should be denied as\npremature. The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is\nin the process of reviewing all files in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> for any such material, and will produce any\nsuch material several weeks in advance of trial. As noted above, that is consistent with governing\nlaw in this Circuit, and the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that she is entitled to\nsuch material as much as four months in advance of trial. Courts in this Circuit have repeatedly\nrefused to compel disclosure of impeachment or Giglio material well in advance of trial, and the\ndefense has provided no particularized basis for even earlier disclosure here.

Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia knew who had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense\ninvolving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret\n“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar\ninterpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°\n\nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll),\nsquares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a\ncharge of <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct\nthat went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted\nsexual abuse. 65l F.3d at 8l7. The government’s atempt to distinguish Coutentos on the\nground that “this case does not involve the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child pornography” (Opp. 4l) misses\nthe point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual\nsexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child\npomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283\nrequires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard\nallegations of conduct beyond those elements.\n\nFinally, the government atempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court\nused the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of\nlimitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the\ngovernment fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-\n\n° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”\n\nlanguage is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-4o (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at\n6o n.ll). Houever, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no\ncase in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any\nevent, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an\nineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3682", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 34\n(PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the\nGovernment’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator\nstatements, and Rule 4o4(b) material. Based on the Government’s response in briefing and\nleters the parties have since submited to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have\nbeen overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not\nentitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will\nrequire the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all\n\nBrady and Giglio Material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v.\nUnited States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain\nevidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under\nGiglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also\ninformation that could be used to impeach a key government witness.” United States v. Coppa,\n267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). As a general rule, “Brady and\nits progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material\nupon request by a defendant.” J/d. at l46. “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in\ntime for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law\nsimply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.” /d. at l44.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9ofl6\n\nThe defamation litigation was legally very complicated and New York law afforded\nmany statutory, common law, and constitutional defenses to Ms. Maxwell (which may become\nrelevant at another time). In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions. Significantly, Judge Sweet’s Order prefaced all the listed categories with\nthe words “sexual activity” an “sexual activities.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury conviction.

A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v.

The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page5of8\nThe Hon.

Accordingly, it is\nnot, as theorized by the government, “Giglio or 35oo” material. Leter, p. 5. Thus, there is no\n“cognizable interest” in “controlling the timing of disclosures,” id., because under the\ngovernment’s “willful blindness” policy there would be nothing to disclose.\n\nThe final “interest” advanced by the government is in “its oun communications.” For\nsupport, the government cites United States v. Carton, No. l7 CR 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). Leter, p. 5.

The government does not explain hou third-party\nsubpoenas would implicate “its oun communications,” which it fails to define. None of Ms.\nMaxwell’s subpoenas seek government work product or internal communications between\ngovernment employees, and the government has no legitimate interest in suppressing third-\nparty communications.!\n\nBut even if the government’s oun communications were at issue, the government has\nwaived any privilege it may have otherwise asserted. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to\nsuppress, the government voluntarily disclosed and atached several internal emails between\nits atorneys. This disclosure (partial though it may be)’ is a waiver of any privilege. See\nUnited States v. Gangi, l F.

Premature disclosure of the evidence would impinge on Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights to effective assistance of counsel and reveal defense strategy and work\nproduct.\n\nRule l6, not Rule l7, governs the timing of any reciprocal discovery request, and it\nprovides that if a defendant requests disclosure from the government under Rule l6(a)(l)(E),\nthen upon compliance with a similar request by the government, the defendant is required to\npermit the government to inspect and copy or photograph documents and tangible objects\nwhich are within the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody or control of the defendant and which the defendant\nintends to introduce at trial.

While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without discovery. Any evidence of the parties’ intent would be in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of\nthe government and Epstein’s counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few\nclues available to the public—such as a privilege log filed in a related civil lawsuit—for crumbs\nof information about the negotiation and investigation.\n\nThe government’s response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic\nevidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—\nshould be preceded by discovery. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three\npages from the above-referenced privilege log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims,\nall of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL’s consultation with the United States\nAtorney’s Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL atorneys to New York, or interviews\nand/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses.

In response, the government has focused on only one of\nthose three entries and produced the documents referenced in the privilege log. See Opp. lo.\n\n7 The government’s argument that a United States Atorney lacks the “authority” to bind other districts (Opp. l3-\nl4)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Atorney has\nnot received the approvals prescribed by internal Justice Department guidelines—is unavailing. The government\ncites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not\nonly by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other\ndistricts—but also by the Second Circuit’s statement that a United States Atorney may bind other districts in a plea\nagreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect.

If the defense were\nto put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose\npermissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the\ndefense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,\nincluding to cross-examine trial witnesses.\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the\nGovernment submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to\noffer these materials under certain circumstances.

For example, the file contains\nmaterials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law enforcement agencies.

(Dkt. No. 2o7).\nA. Overview\nThe Government takes its discovery and disclosure obligations seriously, and it has\nendeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the\npendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its discovery and\ndisclosure plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks\nAct obligations with respect to the materials already in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the prosecution team, but\nthat it also makes reasonable efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the\nfiles of other investigative agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was\nformulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3955", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nto those other agency files in an October 7, 2o2o leter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information\nhere in order to provide context for what, and hou the Government has reviewed files for material\nrelated to the NPA.\n\nIn sum, the Government has not identified any materials within its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> that would\nconstitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to\nwhich “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v. West Virginia, 547 U.S. 867,\n87o (2oo6). With this definition in mind, the Government would view any evidence that the NPA\nwas intended to (l) bind other U.S. Atorneys in other districts; or (ll) cover Maxwell specifically,\nas “evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA” that it would be required to disclose.\n(See April l6, 2o2l Opinion, Dkt. No. 2o7, at 8, 3-7 (discussing the bases for Maxwell’s motion\nunder the NPA)). As set forth in more detail belou, the Government has not identified any such\nevidence in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>.\n\nThe Government does not, houever, view any other materials that are simply re/ated to the\nNPA as materials it is required to disclose in this case, either under Rule l6 or Brady.\nNevertheless, and as the Court recognized, the defendant already has access to a large swath of\ninformation that the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR’’)\ncompiled as a result of their thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the\nnegotiation of the NPA, and the Government has not sought to, nor would it be obligated to, redo\nOPR’s work. (Dkt. No. 2o7, at 8 (noting the “extensive OPR report” and that “No record evidence\nsuggests that prosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing.”’).\nIn the interest of clarity, the Government sets forth belou a description of the materials it has\ncompiled and reviewed, and will continue to review, for potential Brady material in this case, while\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3956", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Bermudez, 526 F.2d 89, loo n.9\n(2d Cir. l975) (no violation of the Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(b), which requires the United\nStates to turn over to defendants the statements of a witness which are “in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the\nUnited States”); see also United States v.

The\ngovernment knous that it “is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have,”\nUnited States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 727, 746 (E.D.N.Y. l994), which is why it refuses to obtain\nthe material. Once again, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s assistance.\n\nInformation is “exculpatory and thus ‘favorable’ to the defense for Brady purposes when\nit directly contradicts the motive theory testified to by prosecution witnesses. Mendez v. Artuz,\n3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2). For the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell’s ex parte\nsubmission, the EVCP Materials directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by\nthe prosecution at trial — that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein.\n\nIn addition, even if the materials were deemed “impeachment only” they would remain\ndiscoverable by a subpoena as exculpatory evidence. Where, as here, the government’s proof\ndepends almost entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the accusers, “impeachment”\nevidence is material and discoverable in advance of trial. As discussed in Poventud v. City of\nNew York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2ol5 WL lo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2ol5),\n\n[I]mpeachment evidence constitutes exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed.\n\nThe disclosure of impeachment evidence, where “the [g]overnment's case depended\n\nalmost entirely on [the victim's] testimony,” Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o,\n\nl54-55 (l972), goes to the heart of Brady and Giglio. See Napue v. People of State\n\nof Illinois, 36o U.S. 264, 269 (l959) (“The jury's estimate of the truthfulness and\n\nreliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3984", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page9ofl3\nThe Hon.

Nou that the government has completely abandoned that position and extended the\nconspiracy to include a time frame up to 2oo4, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel must re-review the\ndiscovery she has already painstakingly reviewed to comb for evidence related to the new time\nperiod.\n\nE. Continuing problems with the government’s evidence production require\n\nadditional time\n\nIn addition to the “new” 2o,ooo pages of exculpatory evidence not yet provided to Ms.\nMaxwell, defense counsel and Ms. Maxwell have encountered significant obstacles in the review\nof the discovery produced prior to April l3\".

The Rule provides that the\ndefense, like the prosecution, must produce witness statements. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\"Ms. Maxwell understands that the Court has ordered that “The Defendant’s Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) disclosures and witness list are due three weeks before the trial\ncommencement date.” See Dkt. No. 25o. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) applies to documents and\nobjects that the defendant intends to use in the defendant’s case-in-chief at trial. Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl6(b)(l)(B) applies to reports of examinations or tests and witnesses who prepared any report or\nexamination if the defense intends to call the witness at trial during the defendant’s case-in-chief.\nAt this stage of the proceeding Ms. Maxwell continues to review the evidence and witness\nmaterials recently provided by the government and has not identified any documents, tests, or\nwitnesses that would fall into these categories.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 _ Filed o5/o3/2l Page 6of7\nThe Hon.

Evidence may, or may not, be necessary after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is reasonable and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a production schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute. Production in\nadvance of trial will also ensure adequate time for the Government to file any relevant motions\nand to prepare any rebutal case as appropriate.

In other words, there will be no dispute at trial that Minor Victim-\n2 did not write about the defendant in her diary.!\n\nThe cases the defendant cites are inapposite. For instance, in United States v. Cheung Kin\nPing, 555 F.2d lo69 (2d Cir. l977), the parties learned that a cooperating witness kept a diary,\nwhich was largely writen in Chinese, while the witness was still on cross-examination. /d. at\nlo78. The witness turned over his diary, but after observing that the “defense was examining his\ndiary, .. . he requested that this not be done.” /d. While the parties were discussing hou to review\nthe diary, including for Brady material, the diary was returned to the witness. It was only given to\nthe defense for examination after “roughly five days” in the witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. /d. at lo79.\nAccordingly, in that case, a diary that had never been evaluated for Brady material—or any other\nmaterial—was taken from a witness in the middle of the witness’s cross-examination, then\nreturned to him for five days. The Second Circuit found that those events “created a serious risk\nthat significant material would be destroyed or tampered with.” /d. Here, in contrast, the diary\ncontains no relevant material—in fact, that is the defendant’s very thesis. See also White v.\nMcKinley, 5l9 F.3d 8o6, 8l4 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (explaining, in a § l983 case, that the plaintiff had\nalleged bad faith by stating that a law enforcement officer in a child molestation case “deliberately\nsteer[ed] the investigation to benefit his love interest,” in part by “‘fail[ing] to preserve the alleged\nvictim’s diary which did not corroborate the molestation allegations,” which in turn “deprived [the\ndefendant] of his right to a fair trial, in part, because he could not testify about the diary without\nwaiving his right not to testify”); United States v. Rios, No. 88 Cr. l86, l989 WL 9289, at *2\n' For similar reasons, the entire diary, full of Minor Vicitm-2’s personal and unrelated information,\nwould not be admissible at trial. See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 7oo (requiring that a Rule l7(c) subpoena\ntarget “admissib[le]” evidence).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page/7of9\n\nPage 7\nindividual “is a prospective witness in this case; the Government will provide Carton with his\n35oo, Jencks and Giglio material by the deadline set by the Court”); United States v.

Here, the Government has discharged its obligations already by providing the\ndefendant with the relevant pages from the diary, and Rule l7(h) bars a search for additional\nstatements.\n\nThe defendant’s theories miss the mark because Request 9, at its core, is precisely the sort\nof “fishing expedition” that Nixon prohibits. 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Accordingly, Request 9 should be\ndenied.\n\nB. Request lo\n\nThe Government understands Request lo to seek a pair of boots purchased by the defendant\nand Jeffrey Epstein for Minor Victim-2. The defendant states that she would like to examine the\nboots in order to “identify the make and provenance of the boots.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt.\nNo. 244 at ll). This appears to be an atempt to use the boots to impeach Minor Victim-2’s\ntestimony, shrouded again in a conclusory claim about the need for authentication. For\nsubstantially the reasons set forth above with respect to the diary, the Government respectfully\nsubmits such a claim is meritless under Nixon.\n\nHouever, and although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government has\nrequested that BSF provide the boots to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’). BSF has\nindicated that Minor Victim-2 will likely agree to do so. When the boots are in the FBI’s custody,\nthe Government intends to make them available promptly to the defense for examination and use\nat trial, and will so notify the Court, which should moot Request lo.

Even though AUSA ggg had a “complete handle on the\nlandscape,” he painted an entirely different, false picture for Judge McMahon.\n\nII. The Government’s Response to Maxwell’s Motion.\n\nConfronted with evidence of AUSA JJ misrepresentations to Judge McMahon,\nthe government has filed a Response reluctantly admiting that the U.S. Atorney’s Office had\nsustained contact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6. Even so, the government tries its best to minimize\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l9 of 34\n\nFor one thing, the government admits that Giuffre’s atorneys turned over several\ndocuments in 2ol6, which were in the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> when AUSA gg claimed\nto Judge McMahon that he did not knou what was in Boies Schiller’s file. Moreover, by the time\nAUSA [RE told Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would\nshou “page after page of people taking the Fifth,” it was already a mater of public record that\nMaxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex. Q, p l.\n\nThe government’s argument also defies logic. The government was asking Judge\nMcMahon to authorize a subpoena of Boies Schiller’s entire file. At a minimum, the government\nhad to have asked Boies Schiller about the size of the file and issues related to privilege to\ndetermine if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or notify either the civil court or\nMaxwell when the subpoena was issued and responsive documents produced. In fact, the\ngovernment issued two subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the first for material covered by the\nProtective Order, and the second for material outside the Protective Order’s reach. Clearly, the\ngovernment knew more about Boies Schiller’s file than AUSA J Ict on.\n\ne Defense 6: The “subject of your investigation” to whom Judge McMahon\n\nreferred was Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAccording to the government, when Judge McMahon asked AUSA J “about\ncontacts between the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the\nissuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation,” Mot. Ex. E, p 2, Judge McMahon\nwas referring only to Epstein. Resp. at 7l. This is not a plausible reading of the transcript.\n\nAfter his first appearance before her, Judge McMahon haled AUSA J back to\ncourt for one reason. “I'll be very up-front with you,” she said. Mot.

But I am not faced with that situation.\n\nNothing in this record suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to\n\ndo with the Government’s decision to convene a grand jury to look into the maters\n\nthat were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the Government has\n\nadvised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties\n\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the\n\nGovernment that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its\n\nfiles because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of\n\n“collusion,” to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller\n\ndid not foment the Government’s investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United\n\nStates Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies\n\nSchiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood on\n\nhis/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.\nId. at 2l.\n\nContrary to Judge McMahon’s understanding, Boies Schiller contacted the government\n(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of “collusion”; it was “quite clear that\nBoies Schiller did . . . foment the Government’s investigation”; and AUSA yg knew\nmuch more about what was in Boies Schiller’s files than he let on.\n\nThe Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant\natempts to foment a criminal investigation of her opponent—is exactly what occurred.\n\nJudge McMahon cannot be faulted for not knouing all the facts. AUSA yg, on\nthe other hand, had a “complete handle on the landscape,” and he withheld the truth from Judge\nMcMahon. Had AUSA J not misled her, it is clear Judge McMahon would not have\nauthorized the subpoena.”!\n\n*l It’s notable that even without the benefit of truth from AUSA J.

Here, the government has confessed enough facts to demonstrate that\nMaxwell at least is entitled to a hearing.\n\nThere is no merit to the government’s assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing\nbecause she has not submited an affidavit in support of her Motion.

The information needed to prove such assertions false is peculiarly within\nthe hands of the government.”).

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia knew who had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ production to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless. Rule l7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third\nparties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial.”\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo.

Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their\nauthenticity. In its May 6 leter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset\nof the photographs are in the FBI’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, and the Government will make those photographs\navailable to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that\nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to\ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon\nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court.\n\nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has\nfailed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell\ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\nrelevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish\nrelevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s\ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nI.

I suppose that Boies Schiller might not want to seem too cooperative with the |\n~ Government, especially if it is concerned about ending up as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging |\nbreach of contract if it has failed to return or destroy the Confidential Materials in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. |\nSee Aioi Nissay Doua Ins. Co. v. ProSight Specialty Mgmt. Co., No. l2-cv-3274, 2ol2 WL |\n3583l76, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2l, 2ol2). But that does not strike this Court as a reason for the |\nGovernment to carry the firm’s water—the moreso because Judge Sweet ruled some months |\nbefore he died that the intervenors’ appeals in Giuffre meant the lawsuit had not “concluded,” ,\nand so had postponed the day when that contractual obligation kicked in. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n967 at 6.)\na This ruling came in response to a motion by Maxwell to compel Giuffre’s compliance with the document\ndestruction provision. It argued that Giuffre’s obligations thereunder were triggered at the time of setlement. (l5- :\nmm Dkt. Nos. 957.) Judge Sweet denied that motion in light of the pending appeals. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt.

The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward discovery materials in their <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagel3oofl4\nFBI.

Oct. l2, 2ol6).\nSeven weeks in advance of trial is far more time than is standard in this district and no shouing\nhas been made that it will be insufficient for Maxwell to make effective use of the information in\npreparation of her defense.\n\nTo the extent Maxwell argues that the Government is in <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of prior statements\nthat are exculpatory under Brady (for example, if a witness denied Maxwell’s involvement),\nrather than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Government’s\nobligation to “disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes\nknoun to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the\npreparation of its case.” Dkt. 68 at l. The context of questions and answers surely maters as to\nwhether a statement (or omission) is exculpatory, impeaching, or neither. It is for the\nGovernment to make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its disclosure obligations so that\nthe defense may make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial. See United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44-46 (2d Cir. 2ool). The Government has repeatedly\nconfirmed that it understands those obligations, and that it has met them and will continue to\nmeet them. Accordingly, the motion to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor\nVictim-4’s prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell is denied.\nof objection, the Court presumes the Government intends to disclose this information to Maxwell at the\nsame time that as it discloses Jencks Act material.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4987", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 32o Filed o8/l8/2l Page2of4\nHonorable Alison J.

See, e.g., Annie\nFarmer v. Indyke, et al., No. l9 Civ. lo475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for\nproduction of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, black\nboots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of\nthe photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknoun whether the items\nare currently in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer. Ms. Maxwell proposes to serve a\nsubpoena, atached as Exhibit l, on Ms. Annie Farmer for the physical items; counsel also\nproposes that service be effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.'

The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information\nbeyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,\nMaria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria\nFarmer v. Indyke et al., l9 Civ. lo474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed\nsubpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.\n\nDefense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,\nhouever, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either\n\n' Fed.

See\nFirst Motion at ll, l5-l6. Maria Farmer is the individual who purportedly introduced her\nyounger sister to Jeffrey Epstein. In her civil lawsuit and in numerous public statements, Ms.\nMaria Farmer has asserted that she has certain physical items that substantiate her allegations\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. She described in various publications certain\n“envelopes” that she “still has” with the touch DNA and fingerprints of Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell.” Ms. Maxwell seeks to examine those envelopes and to test them in advance\nof trial to disprove Maria Farmer’s claims.\n\nMaria Farmer also reportedly met with atorneys Brad Edwards and Stanley Potinger at\nher home in Paducah, KY in or about June 2ol6. To counsel’s knouledge, those atorneys have\nnever represented Maria Farmer. Brad Edwards describes in his self-published memoir,\nRelentless Pursuit, that Maria Farmer during that meeting shoued him substantial physical\nevidence corroborating her claims against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including\nphotographs, diaries, telephone books, Rolodexes and mementos collected from her “time with\nEpstein and Maxwell.” See Ex. 2(A). Ms. Maxwell also seeks to examine these items of\nphysical evidence in advance of trial so that her experts and investigation team may rebut any\nsuch evidence and effectively confront this accuser. The requests for her atorneys’ fee\nagreements and her EVCP Materials are identical to those in the BSF subpoena, but are being\nrequested directly from her in the event her atorneys claim they do not have constructive\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> or control over those items.\n\n? In a podcast with journalist Whitney Webb which aired on May 26, 2o2o, Maria Farmer\nclaimed to possess “envelopes” that “still have the touch DNA and fingerprints on them” of\n“Jeffrey and Ghislaine” and that she offered them to the FBI but the FBI said “we don’t need it.”\nhtps://soundcloud.com/user-4l4392239/27l-epstein-victim-maria-farmer-speaks-part-2-the-last-\namerican-vagabond-whitney-webb\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page /7 oflo\nRe =3N°w BE claims she was abused by Epstein and Maxwell,\n2l es Sec Indictment { 7(o):\nes\nES.

See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr. 7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6,\nat *l (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2oo4) (“Defendants may not invite the jury to speculate as to why [a\nparticular] charge was not included in the indictment.”), aff'd and remanded, 433 F.3d 273 (2d\nCir. 2oo6). At trial, the questions for the jury will be whether, based on the evidence presented,\nthe defendant participated in the charged Mann Act and sex trafficking offenses. Nothing about\nthe decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office has any bearing on the defendant’s guilt or\ninnocence.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2ol2),\nonly underscores this point. In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247. White was traveling in a\nvehicle with four other people on the day of his arrest, and “[t]he defense’s strategy was to seek\nto demonstrate that the [firearm in question] was found in the vehicle and not on White’s\nperson.” Jd. at 238. All five individuals were arrested and charged that day in state court with\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the firearm at issue. See id. at 239. Under New York law, a firearm found in an\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 54\nautomobile is deemed to be the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of all passengers in the automobile unless the firearm\nis found on the person of a particular passenger. See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White. In White, the state’s earlier charging\ndecision directly contradicted a consequential fact in the case—whether the defendant was in\nactual <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the gun. It was therefore highly relevant as evidence used to undermine the\ncredibility of the officers testifying to the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. Here, houever, the\nGovernment’s past charging decisions are entirely irrelevant to any factual issue in the case or\nthe credibility of any witness. See Wats, 934 F. Supp. 2d at 485 (distinguishing White in a\nconspiracy case because “a conspiracy necessarily involves agreement amongst more than one\nactor to engage in criminal conduct for which all members of the conspiracy may be found\nequally culpable’).\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo542o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagellof 24\nsexual exploitation of children and <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child pornography’). To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited.

In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247.

All five individuals were arrested and charged that day in state court with\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the firearm at issue. See id. at 239.

See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White.

It was therefore highly relevant as evidence used to undermine the\ncredibility of the officers testifying to the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. Here, houever, the\nGovernment’s past charging decisions are entirely irrelevant to any factual issue in the case or\nthe credibility of any witness. See Wats, 934 F.

Disclose, as to the\nactual statements, according to the government, means “produced” at some time in the past or to\nbe produced in the future, perhaps as an oral statement during trial.\n\nOf course, the Court will tell the parties whether it meant two completely different things\nwhen it used the same word, as argued by the government, or whether it intended for the\ngovernment to disclose the statements it intends to offer as co-conspirator statements. To avoid\ndelay over this issue during trial, Ms. Maxwell suggests that she cannot litigate this issue in\nadvance of trial without knouing what statements are being offered under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 8ol(d)(2)(e).\n\nWhat is clear from the government’s response is not that it misunderstood the Order, but\nrather, it continues to disagree with the Order.\n\nB. The Court Has the Authority to Require Disclosure\n\nSecond, doubling doun on its disagreement with the Court, the government claims “‘t is\naware of no such case” in which a court ordered the identification of anticipated co-conspirator\nstatements prior to trial. While the government may not be “aware” of such cases, they certainly,\nand abundantly, exist.\n\nIn United States v. Bocio, lo3 F. Supp. 2d 53l, 534 (N.D.N.Y. 2ooo), the court ordered\npretrial disclosure of statements of co-conspirators (Government “must disclose to the defendant\nand make available for inspection, copying, or photographing: any relevant writen or recorded\nstatements ..., or copies thereof, within the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody, or control of the government.”).\n\nIn United States v. Jacobs, 65o F. Supp. 2d l6o, l7l (D. Conn. 2oo9), the court ordered\nco-conspirator statements be produced in advance of trial (“In the case of a co-conspirator who\nthe government plans to call as a witness at trial, that time is nou, and the government is directed\nto produce any relevant statement to defense counsel forthwith.”)\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6888", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). To meet this burden, the Government need only introduce “sufficient proof. . .\nso that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.” United States v.\nTin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal quotation marks omited). For “a document\natributed to the defendant, the prosecution need only provide a rational basis from which the jury\ncould infer that the document did, in fact, belong to [her].” United States v. Osarenkhoe, 439 F.\nApp’x 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order) (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nEvidence of authenticity “may be direct or circumstantial, and the later category may\ninclude distinctive characteristics of the document itself.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,\n922 F.2d 934, 957 (2d Cir. l99o); Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 37. Indeed, Rule 9ol contemplates\nmultiple avenues through which a proponent may authenticate evidence. For example, the\nproponent may offer “[t]estimony that an item is what it is claimed to be,” or may offer evidence\nof “[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of\nthe item, taken together with all the circumstances.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(l) and (4).\n\nHere, the testimony of Employee-l establishes the authenticity of Government Exhibit 52.\nIn particular, the fact that Employee-l recognizes this exhibit and can identify it as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its “distinctive characteristics” is all that Rule 9ol requires. Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar circumstances, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. In United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order), the defendant argued that the Government had failed to establish the authenticity\nof “handwriten leters that were found in a USB drive that was handed to an agent of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” Jd. at 24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge.\n“Although the Government did not present evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6966", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\nseizure of the USB drive, Federal Rule of Evidence 9ol(b)(4) permits authentication based on\n‘[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the\nitem, taken together with all the circumstances.’” /d. (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Evid\n9ol(b)(4)). Witness testimony about the content of the leters was “sufficient to pass the relatively\nlou bar for authentication of evidence,” and the Second Circuit explained that “any remaining\nquestions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary weight, not their admissibility.”\nId. at 24-25; see United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 67 (2d Cir. l983), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 5lo U.S. 249 (l994) (leter’s contents were\nsufficient to authenticate it under Rule 9ol(b)(4)).\n\nThe same is true here. Employee-l will identify Government Exhibit 52 as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its appearance and contents. Moreover, Employee-l’s testimony will be\ncorroborated by the contents of the book itself, which includes (a) contact information for the\ndefendant’s family, and (b) contact information for victims who interacted with the defendant\nduring the relevant time period. That is more than sufficient to establish the authenticity of the\nexhibit under Rule 9ol. To the extent the defense disputes Employee-l’s testimony, or takes issue\nwith the circumstances under which Government Exhibit 52 came into the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>,* those arguments are for the jury. The anticipated testimony satisfies Rule 9ol, and\nthe evidence should be admited.\n\n3 Tt is a mater of public record that in 2oo9, an employee of Jeffrey Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez,\natempted to sell Government Exhibit 52 to a plaintiffs atorney. The atorney contacted the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and agents seized Government Exhibit 52 from Rodriguez, who\nwas arrested. Rodriguez has stated that he took the book from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nduring his employment for Epstein from 2oo4 to early 2oo5. Government Exhibit 52 has remained\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the FBI since that time. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and\nacknouledged that he was obligated to turn this evidence over to the FBI years earlier, when he\nwas interviewed during the course of the FBI’s investigation of Epstein. See United States v.\nAlfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM).

Watson, 64o F.3d, 5ll-l2.\n\n2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges\n3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a \"common method of\n4 undermining a prosecution\" by, for example, cross-examining\n\n5 officers on which leads they folloued and which they did not.\n\n6 See, for example, Gray v. Ercole —-— I don't have that full\n\n7 quote —--— 2oll WL 5o82868 (E.D.N.Y 2oo8). Or defense counsel\n\n8 may, on cross, examine investigating officers if they\n\n9 considered alternative suspects. United States v. Birbal, 92\nlo CR 98, l996 WL l92924 at *7, that's the District of the\n\nll Vermont, l996. That was affirmed by the Second Circuit at ll3\nl2 F.3d l23o. And I will quote here, \"The length of the\n\nl3 investigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact\nl4 that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\nl5 investigation are all irrelevant pursuant to\" the principle\n\nl6 that the government's failure to use particular investigative\nl7 techniques does not tend to shou that the defendant is not\n\nl8 guilty.

First, as a mater of fact, Government Exhibit 52 was not something that\nthe cooperating government witness reviewed, used, or saw during her brief employment with\nJeffrey Epstein. Records produced in discovery reflect that witness began working for Epstein in\nME At that point, the suspect source of Government Exhibit 52, Alfredo Rodriguez, was not\nemployed by Epstein because he had been fired in 2oo4.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rodriguez, when he left the Epstein home he took an address book,\nwhich he claimed was Epstein’s book, and had it in his <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> until 2oo9 when he tried to\nsell it to Brad Edwards for $5o,ooo.' The book was clearly altered by Mr. Rodriguez. The single\n\n' Mr. Rodriguez knew the target of his intended sale which makes the likelihood of\nalteration all the more probable.

(See ll/o5/2l Gov’t Leter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably\nforeseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein’s efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was\nsexually atracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—lin the course\nof that conspiracy. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed.\nSee United Sates v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“The definition of victim under\nthe CVRA is expansive.

R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) (emphasis added).\n\nUnder subsection (b)(l)(A)(il), a defendant’s reciprocal discovery obligations are limited\nto material—specifically books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects,\nbuildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items—that she intends to use in her\n“case-in-chief.”\n\nIn turn, a party’s “case-in-chief” includes only “[t]he evidence presented at trial by a\nparty between the time the party calls the first witness and the time the party rests.” Black’s Law\nDictionary (llth ed. 2ol9). By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “case-in-chief” does not\ninclude her cross-examination of a prosecution witness during the government’s “case-in-chief.”\n\nHere, Ms. Maxwell has not called her first witness. Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started. Because Ms. Maxwell has not begun her case-in-chief, she had no\nobligation under Rule l6(b)(l)(A) to disclose the photograph she offered in evidence while\ncross-examining Jane.\n\nThere is no doubt Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not apply to material a defendant offers into\nevidence while cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief. The l974\nCommitee Notes to Rule l6 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(l)(A) provides that the\ndefendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>,\ncustody, or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief.” Fed.

Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v.

To be clear, the document does not\nactually establish that fact: The defendant herself has testified under oath that she lived in the 44\nKinnerton Street residence beginning in l992 or l993 (see Exhibit B), and even assuming the date\nof sale is accurate, it hardly precludes the possibility that the defendant lived there at an earlier\ndate.\n\nIll.

By failing to disclose\nthe agreement until the close of the Government’s case, the defendant has prevented the\nGovernment from conducting a full investigation, causing prejudice to the Government. The Court\n2 Nor does it preclude the possibility that Kate was simply mistaken about which of the defendant’s\nLondon residences she first visited.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nshould preclude the defendant from offering the agreement nou in her case-in chief.\n\nFirst, the agreement was in the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody, and control long before\ntrial. The sale agreement is a contract between the defendant herself and third parties. If a copy\nof the agreement was not in her personal <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, it surely was obtainable through her counsel\nin that transaction—who is expected to testify at trial.\n\nSecond, as noted, the theory of relevance for the sale agreement that the Government\nanticipates has been clear since long before the defendant’s Rule l6 deadline. The Government\nexpects that the defendant will try to use the agreement to shou that she did not purchase the\ntounhome on Kinnerton Street until January l997. Kate testified that she visited that home in\nl994, when she was l7. (Tr. ll76).\n\nKate’s testimony was not a surprise to the defense. Kate described the home in an interview\nwith the Government on September l, 2o2l, a report of which was produced to the defense on\nOctober ll. See 35l3-o37 at 8 (FBI 3o2); 35l3-o38 at l2 (underlying notes). Although Kate did\nnot give the street address, she identified the house’s location as across the street from the Nags\nHead Pub. That fact did not go unnoticed by the defense, which made a point of confirming with\nKate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on Kinnerton Street across from\nthe Nags Head Pub—twice. Tr. l235, l253-54. Even before the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial, the defense previewed its view that Kate’s timeline is incorrect and she was older at the\ntime of certain events than she testified she was.

The government should knou what is in the remainder\nof the journal; it simply chooses selective ignorance and relies on lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell\nfor cover. This type of selective disclosure of information is routinely rejected by courts, including\nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Knoun as the “fairness doctrine,” when one party makes\nassertions about parts of a communication or writing the entire communication loses protected\nstatus and requires disclosure to the opposing party. The aim of the doctrine is to protect the adverse\n“party, the factfinder, and the judicial process from selectively disclosed and potentially misleading\nevidence.” Jn re von Bulou, 828 F.2d 94, lo2 (2d Cir. l987); see also United States v.\n\nBilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l292 (2d Cir. l99l); Joy v.

F.R.E. lo6, the Rule of Completeness,\nallous that “[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party\nmay require the introduction, at that time, of any other part--or any other writing or recorded\nstatement--that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6l2 is also applicable here and states:\n(a) Scope. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness\nuses a writing to refresh memory:\n(l) while testifying; or\n(2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to\nhave those options.\n(b) Adverse Party's Options; Deleting Unrelated Mater. Unless l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to\nhave the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the\nwitness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the\nwitness's testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes\nunrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\nAny portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.\n(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if\nthe prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the\nwitness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial.\nThe witness has admited using the journal to refresh her memory. Title l8 of U.S. Code\n§ 35oo is inapplicable here by its very terms because the remainder of the journal is, admitedly,\nnot in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the government. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) (applies exclusively to\nstatements “in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the United States”); see also United States v.

The indictment\nand the accusers are vague regarding when things happened, what things happened and who may\nhave been present when anything is alleged to have happened. Accuser-2’s journal contains\ndated entries that place events in context with other alleged events. Accuser-2’s journal from\nl996 purports to document encounters with Epstein in New York. The S2 indictment, paragraph\n9(b), claims that “Maxwell interacted with [Accuser-2] on at least one occasion in or about l996\nat Epstein’s residence in New Mexico....” The journal references other dates, places, and events\nin l996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell in context with other recorded events is\nboth relevant and exculpatory.\n\nAs a piece of physical evidence, the journal is subject to inspection and testing. See F. R.\nCrim. P. l7(c)(l). Moreover, were the journal in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the government it would be\nsubject to inspection under F. R. Crim. P. l6 (a) (l) (E) which provides, in relevant part:\n\nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to\ninspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data,\nphotographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of\nany of these items, if the tem is within the government's <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>,\ncustody, or control and:\n\n(i) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial[.]\n\nTo avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted partisan\nphotocopies of five substantive pages without questioning the provenance of an exhibit it intends\nto introduce at trial. Comparison of one of the five pages demonstrates the problem. Atached as\nexhibit A is a photocopy of a journal entry first produced during the civil litigation.

The remaining six pages are identical except for the identifying bate ranges.\nExamination of the original document would answer legitimate questions about whether the\ndocument has been manipulated, altered, or fabricated.

This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original\nrequest was ex parte, nou the government is taking <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the very things subject to Ms.\nMaxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of\nevidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the\nsubpoena, not to the government.\n\nRequest ll, the Photographs\n\nRegarding item ll, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical\npositions. In its leter of May 4, 2o2l, the government first advised the Court that it obtained\n“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.\nTwo days later it admited that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution\nTeam’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 8ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Any original photographs will have markings that identify when the film was\ndeveloped and other indicia indicating whether they are genuine or not. Again, like the journal,\nthe government has outsourced the fact and truth finding function regarding the photographs to\npartisan advocates. If the government possessed the originals Ms. Maxwell would have the Rule\nl6 right to inspect them, just like the many photographs she inspected between April l2 and\nApril l6, 2o2l.\n\nFinally, the government devotes much of its submission atempting to bait Ms. Maxwell\ninto revealing defense strategy and work product.

While the EVCP cannot divine the reason behind that shift in legal strategy, it\nappears as if she is atempting to do an end run around the Court’s prior rulings or believes that\nrenewing those requests will be unfruitful. The EVCP is not suggesting that Ms. Maxwell renew\nher earlier requests directed at EVCP claimants. The EVCP believes that no participant should\nbe required to turn over their confidential submissions against their wishes.

The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id.

The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”). The Government had, after all, publicly\nportrayed these as “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Motion to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 29 of 3l\nUnseal at 3. Had the Government’s motion made clear that these records are redundant of the\nevidence at Maxwell’s public trial, the victims’ responses to the motion to unseal might well\nhave been different.\n\nVarious leters also express alarm or dismay at other recently reported, or anticipated,\nGovernment actions regarding Maxwell.'® These concerns, houever, are properly directed to the\npolitical branches. The Court has not considered them in resolving the motion to unseal.\n\nll. The Systemic Interest in Grand Jury Secrecy\n\nA final consideration is systemic. “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system\ndepends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 2l8. For\nthat reason, the Supreme Court has instructed louer courts “considering the effects of disclosure\non grand jury proceedings” to assess “the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand\njuries,” mindful that “[p]ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their\ntestimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties.” /d. at 222; see also Procter & Gamble\nCo., 356 U.S. at 682 (“The grand jury as a public institution serving the community might suffer\nif those testifying today knew that the secrecy of their testimony would be lifted tomorrou.”);\nBaker v. U.S. Steel Corp., 492 F.2d lo74, lo76 n.2 (2d Cir. l974) (similar).\n\n'8 These include the Government’s decision, while pursuing release of the grand jury materials,\nto not publicly release further records from its investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, see, e.g.,\nDkt. 8o4 at 9 (noting “the much larger volume of information available in the ‘more than 3oo\ngigabytes of data and physical evidence’ in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> that should be\ndisclosed as well”); its “suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming,” id.\nat 8; its not having given notice to victims before it filed the instant motion to unseal, id. at 8, l6,\n2l; its transfer of Maxwell to a louer security prison, which, a leter states, “has further eroded\nthe victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities,” id. at l5; the possibility that\nMaxwell might receive clemency, id. at l5—l6; and the DAG’s decision to meet with Maxwell\n“as though she were a credible authority,” which, one leter states, has publicly “legitimiz[ed]\nher,” id. at l5; see also id. at 2o.\n\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015174.jpg": "and former principals, officers, directors, stockholders, managers, members, partners,\nlimited partners, trustees, beneficiaries, administrators, agents, employees, atorneys,\npredecessors, successors, assigns and affiliates, and any entities or individuals who are\nor have ever been engaged by (whether as independent contractors or otherwise),\nemployed by, worked in any capacity for, or provided any services to Mr. Epstein, the\nEpstein Entities or the Epstein Estate (jointly and severally, the “Releasees”), from any\nand all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money,\naccounts, variances, trespasses, damages and judgments, whether sounding in equity,\ntort, common law, contract, statute, regulation or otherwise and whether nou existing,\nhereafter existing or revived in the future whatsoever in law, admiralty, equity or\notherwise, including without limitation any and all claims or causes of action that arise\nor may arise from or which otherwise concern acts of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein (the\n“Claims”) which against the Releasees, Releasor ever had, nou has or hereafter can, shall\nor may have, for, upon, or by reason of any mater, cause or thing whatsoever from the\nbeginning of the world through the date of this General Release.\n\nThis General Release is a broad release of any and all Claims of Releasor against\nany and all Releasees, including without limitation any and all causes of action, lawsuits,\nclaims, demands, damages and liability whatsoever, and also including without\nlimitation to the extent of their respective liability for the same, any and all such claims\nagainst any and all Releasees for contribution as to any other person or persons who may\nbe determined to have been joint tortfeasors arising out of or in any way related to any\nand all knoun and unknoun personal injuries, and also including without limitation any\nderivative claims for loss of consortium, under any federal, state or local law, without\nlimitation.

So it was a central\n\n8 fact. It was admited by Mr. Epstein. It was put forth in\n\n9 their claims against him, and that is all covered in the\n\nlo summary judgment motion. It was admited on an answer. It was\nll the only admission on that point. And then it was testified to\nl2 in a deposition. So I don't think that saying it was not an\n\nl3 issue in the case can possibly withstand scrutiny when you look\nl4 at all of these.\n\nl5 Also, the factual background about the witness that\n\nl6 they said that they would call to dispute this, we've\n\nl7 interviewed this witness, and his testimony is not at all in\n\nl8 contradiction to this.

He\n\nl9 said Mr. Epstein wasn't living there for the first three weeks\n2o that he was hired in December of '95, and took <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> in\nal early '96.

Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay\nis lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may\nhave already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is\nobtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019548.jpg": "Cased ADAP SBos AT en (dc WME 32 FiRAB62o/Pageigei3l ab3\nstake. And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation.

Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial.

Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of\nJustice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n§ l5l3(a)(l)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in <span class=\"highlight\">Possession</span> of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(l) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43.

See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 PSR notes several\ninstances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.\nDoc. l88 at 8-lo.

Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all\ncharges until proven guilty, houever. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\ninnocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020787.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel69 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 34\n\n(PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting cases). The Court therefore\ndenies Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\nVIL. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures\n\nMaxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it\nhas in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the\nGovernment’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator\nstatements, and Rule 4o4(b) material. Based on the Government’s response in briefing and\nleters the parties have since submited to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have\nbeen overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not\nentitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will\nrequire the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all\n\nBrady and Giglio Material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v.\nUnited States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain\nevidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under\nGiglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also\ninformation that could be used to impeach a key government witness.” United States v. Coppa,\n267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). Asa general rule, “Brady and\nits progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material\nupon request by a defendant.” /d. at l46. “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in\ntime for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law\nsimply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.” /d. at l44.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o787", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020822.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o4 of 2o8\nFBI. The Court has ordered the Government to disclose all Jencks Act and Giglio material by\nOctober ll, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 297 at l. That date is seven weeks in advance of trial. The Court\nsees no reason to depart from the rule in this district that impeachment material of anticipated\nwitnesses does not warrant an order compelling immediate disclosure. See United States v.\nCampo Flores, No. l5 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2ol6 WL 5946472, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l2, 2ol6).\nSeven weeks in advance of trial is far more time than is standard in this district and no shouing\nhas been made that it will be insufficient for Maxwell to make effective use of the information in\npreparation of her defense.\n\nTo the extent Maxwell argues that the Government is in <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of prior statements\nthat are exculpatory under Brady (for example, if a witness denied Maxwell’s involvement),\nrather than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Government’s\nobligation to “disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes\nknoun to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the\npreparation of its case.” Dkt. 68 at l. The context of questions and answers surely maters as to\nwhether a statement (or omission) is exculpatory, impeaching, or neither. It is for the\nGovernment to make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its disclosure obligations so that\nthe defense may make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial. See United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44-46 (2d Cir. 2ool). The Government has repeatedly\nconfirmed that it understands those obligations, and that it has met them and will continue to\nmeet them. Accordingly, the motion to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor\nVictim-4’s prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell is denied.\nof objection, the Court presumes the Government intends to disclose this information to Maxwell at the\nsame time that as it discloses Jencks Act material.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o822", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021072.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page25 of ll3\n\n4. Under Count Four, it was necessary to prove that Defendant caused Jane to\ntravel to New York with the intent that she would engage in illegal sexual activity\nthat violated New York Penal Law §l3o.55.

But the court refused to correct the jurors’ misunderstanding, merely\ndirecting them to the charge which they had in their <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> and to which they\nwere already plainly referring when they asked about the “second element” of\n“count four.” Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, to which the\nNote referred, presented the jury with an alternative basis for conviction that was\nentirely distinct from the charges in the Indictment. The Court’s refusal to correct\nthe jury’s obvious misunderstanding, constituted a constructive amendment and/or\na variance from the charges in the Indictment.\n\n5.

That case warrants close\natention. In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment\nin the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and\npossessing heroin with intent to distribute. See 77l F.2d at 67l. After they pled\nguilty to the substantive importation charge, the prosecutor represented to the court\nthat “the only agreement that exists between defendants and the Government is that\nat the time of the imposition of sentence ..., the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts...”. /d. Accordingly, the conspiracy and\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> counts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were\nindicted in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to distribute heroin.\nSee id. Whereas the dismissed EDNY charges had only alleged a conspiracy on or\nabout a date in l982, the new SDNY charges alleged criminal conduct extending\nfrom l982 to l985. The defendants argued that these new charges were barred by\ntheir plea agreement with the USAO-EDNY. See id. The court conducted an\nevidentiary hearing—obtaining testimony from both the prosecutor and the defense\natorney from the Eastern District proceedings—and concluded that the agreement\nwas not meant to bind the USAO-SDNY.

Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4 (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (Graves, J.); U.S. v. Coutentos, 65l\nF.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll). In Coutentos, a jury found the defendant guilty on two\ncounts: sexual exploitation or atempted sexual exploitation of a minor to produce\nchild pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) and (d)) and <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> or atempted\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of child pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)).

No more than the offense of\n\npossessing methamphetamine involves the act of producing it, does\n\nthe offense of child pornography involve the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nThat a producer of child pornography will possess it at the time of the\n\nabuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing\n\nchild pornography itself does not involve an act against a child, l.e.,\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia knew who had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

The postponement of the trial will allou for the defense to\n\nreview voluminous discovery and conduct a defense investigation of the case.\n\nOn November 22, 2ol9, I informed the Government that I would provide them with\n\na hard drive during the November 25, 2ol9 initial status conference. On November\n\n25, 2ol9, I provided the Government with a hard drive for discovery and the\n\nGovernment informed the Court that they would produce discovery in 3o days. The\n\nGovernment forwarded discovery on the hard drive to my office on December 3l,\n\n2ol9. The discovery was received by my office on January 2, 2o2o.

Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin.

The Complete Inspector General’s Report, as Well as the Other Reports\nRequested Are Necessary for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense\n. Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.l99l) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F.\nSupp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4) Numerous federal districts have repeatedly ruled that “evidence\nis material under Rule l6 as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022036.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l3 of 38\nin uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation, corroborating testimony, or\nassisting impeachment or rebutal.” United States v. Marshall, l32 F.3d 63, 68 (D.C. Cir. l998)\n(quoting United States v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 35l (D.C. Cir. l993)) (internal quotation marks\nomited). Courts have interpreted the scope of Rule l6 (a)(l)(E){i) broadly to ensure that\n| defendants such as Mr. Thomas have a fair opportunity to prepare for trial, United States v.\nPoindexter, 727 F. Supp. l47o, l473 (D.D.C. l989) (“The language and the spirit of the Rule are\ndesigned to provide to a criminal defendant, in the interest of fairness, the widest possible\nopportunity to inspect and receive such materials in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the government as may aid\nhim in presenting his side of the case.”) Accordingly, the “materiality standard normally is not a |\nheavy burden.” United States v. Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 35o, 356 (S.D.N. ¥.2oo7) (quoting United\nStates v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 35l (D.C.Cir.l993)). Lloyd, 992 F.2d at 35l (internal citation and\nquotation marks omited); United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. ll, l3 (D.D.C. l99l) (the\nmateriality hurdle “is not a high one”). The requested documents in this motion are essential to\nMr. Thomas’ ability to prepare a defense. Mr. Thomas contends that the conduct with which he\nis being charged is: l) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with knouledge and acquiescence\nby the leadership of the BOP; and 3) is the direct result of BOP policies and mismanagement that\nforced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is nou being charged criminally.\nMoreover, the information sought in this motion is crucial to the preparation of Mr. Thomas’\ndefense. For instance, Mr. Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the\nMCC in August of 2ol9 led to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is nou criminally charged. If\nthe Court accepts this representation, then the Court should find that the discovery requests\n| contained in this motion are “material” and must be disclosed. As support for this position the\ndefendant has atached an excerpt from a union commitee meeting that was held merely 3 days\nbefore Jeffrey Epstein died at MCC on August lo, 2ol9.

Thus, clearly, this Court should not permit the government to selflimit\ndiscovery.

Bryan sought\ndiscovery, under Rule l6(a)(l)(C) of items that were in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the FBI. The charges\nagainst Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further\nobjection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the\nmater was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government’s objection.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o38", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022039.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l6 of 38\n\nBryan argued, conversely, that the ‘government’ under the Rule, included not only the\nprosecutors, but also any closely connected investigative agencies. The Court dispensed with the\n‘out of District’ argument by the government, ruling that Rule l6 was not so limiting.\n\nWith respect to the issue of production of items from other closely connected agencies,\nthe Court found in favor of Bryan as far as discovery of items by such agencies. In seting forth\nthe rule, the Court said: “The prosecutor will be deemed to have knouledge of and access to\nanything im the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody and control of any federal agency participating in the same\ninvestigation of the defendant.” Jd.at lo36.\n\nThe District Courts of New York have folloued Bryan, supra. In United States of\nAmerica v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 2o4 (E.D.N.Y. l999), also a corrections/police officer case,\nthe Court found that the materials were discoverable from any other agencies “allied with the\nprosecution.” Jd. at 2l, In addition, in citing to Bryan, supra, the Court stated that: “Another\nfactor in the analysis is whether or not the prosecution has access to the materials.” fd\n\nIn this mater, defendant, Thomas, has shoun that other agencies ‘allied with the\nprosecution,” have and/or are, participating with each other. The statement of Atorney General,\nWilliam Barr, confirms that a separate investigation was initiated by the Inspector General.\nAdditionally, it seems more than obvious that the internal affairs division within the BOP\nconducted a separate investigation into the events in questions. Importantly, Rule l6 focuses on\nthe preparation of the defense. Therefore, documents are material under Rule l6 and subject to\ndisclosure if they help the defense to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s\ncase.

Moreover, the defense is already in <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>\nof witness statements that one or both of the defendants in this indictment may have conducted\nrounds or inmate counts on August lo, 2ol9. Accordingly, there is a logical assumption that\nthere might be additional exculpatory statements contained in the Inspector General’s report or\ncertain internal reports maintained by the BOP internal affairs division or other government\nagencies that were conducting a contemporaneous investigation with FBI.\n\nThe prosecution must produce to the defense not only all favorable evidence that is\nadmissible, but also all evidence “that is likely to lead to favorable evidence that would be\nadmissible.” Safavian, 233 at l7 (quoting United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 2d ll96, ll98-\n99 (C.D,Cal, l999)). Just as with Rule l6 disclosure, the government must interpret its Brady\nobligations broadly. “Where doubt exists as to the usefulness of the evidence to the defendant,\nthe government must resolve all such doubts in favor of full disclosure.” fd. (citing United States\nv. Paxson, 86l F.2d 73o, 737 (D.C. Cir. l988). Without question, the Brady disclosure\nobligation is broader than Rule l6 because it requires production not just of documents, but also\nof information knoun to the government that has been documented in some fashion.\n\n. In Safavian, the court explained the materiality standard under Brady that applies to\npretrial discovery: .\n[T]he government must always produce any potentially\n\nexculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to hou\nthe withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the\nbenefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial. The\nquestion before trial is not whether the government thinks that\ndisclosure of the information or evidence it is considering\nwithholding might change the outcome of the trial going forward,\nbut whether the evidence is favorable and therefore must be\ndisclosed.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022068.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 6 of 34\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition to defendant\nMichael Thomas’s motion to compel discovery. (Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”). Thomas seeks an order\ncompelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, not discoverable\nunder any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas’s motion is\nentirely without merit and should be denied.!\n\nThomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of discovery directly\nrelevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his\npurported defenses, namely, that he commited the offenses because of staffing issues and\nsupervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions.

More importantly, Thomas\nis not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate\nreasons. First, the records are not “material” to preparing a defense because they are wholly\nirrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to\nnullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the “<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>”\nof the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect\nmaterials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were\nnot part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no\nlegal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-\nOIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to\ndiscovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they “falsif[ied] the same\ndocuments,” (Mot. 6), because he has uterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to\nprosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\nThomas’s motion should be denied in all respects.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nl.

The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period,\nfrom approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day,\nAugust lo, 2ol9, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As\ncharged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated\ncounts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false\ncertifications atesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the\nSHU were conducted from approximately lo:3o p.m. on August 9 to 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nI. Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government’s Discovery Production\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a discovery deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022071.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 9 of 34\nnotes. On January 3o, 2o2o,°? the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with\ntimestamps, and on March l6, 2o2o, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic\ndevices and a photograph of a text message.\n\nB. Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials\n\nThe defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in\nresponse to which the Government has provided information in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> as consistent with\nRule l6 and its other disclosure obligations, as described belou.\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November ll, 2ol9, Thomas, through counsel, raised\nthe issue of an “ongoing . . . report” by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the\n“status” of the report and when it would be completed.* (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2ol9, at 3-4, 7-9).\nIn response, the Government explained that “to the extent counsel’s asking for a summary of the\nresults of the criminal investigation, obviously we’ll be turning over in discovery all of the\nunderlying results of the criminal investigation. . . . I don’t have a time frame on the [I]nspector\n[G]eneral report, but the [G]overnment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery\nmaterials in this mater, which includes the Rule l6 materials relevant to the criminal charges that\nhave been brought against the defendants.” (/d. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve,\nthe Court declined to rule at that time.\n\nOn January 29, 2o2o, Thomas and Noel each submited discovery requests to the\nGovernment. Thomas’s leter reiterated his prior request for “any and all reports, memorandums,\n\n3 The January 3o, 2o2o production was made to Noel’s counsel on January 24, 2o2o, while\nthe Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas’s counsel.\n\n* Based on conversations with atorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the\nGovernment understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of\nJeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022072.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page lo of 34\nwriten statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the\nUnited States Inspector General.” Noel’s January 29 leter sought materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating\nparticular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously\nproduced in discovery.\n\nAt the pretrial conference the follouing day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request\nfor “whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with\nrespect to the Inspector General’s report.” (Conf. Tr., Jan. 3o, 2o2o, at 6, 9). The Court directed\nThomas to file a motion formalizing his request. (Id. at 9).°\n\nThe Government responded to the defendants’ discovery requests by leter dated March\nl4, 2o2o. As for Thomas’s request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General’s\nreport, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2ol9\npretrial conference. With respect to Noel’s requests for additional materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced. In\naddition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel’s questions,\nincluding video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage.\n\nOn March 27, 2o2o, Thomas submited another discovery request to the Government,\nseeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and\ninformation about the Government’s charging decisions. The Government responded by leter\n\n> Thomas, through counsel, previewed that he would also likely file a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment based on “selective prosecution.” (Conf. Tr., Jan. 3o, 2o2o at 6). The deadline for\nfiling motions, which was extended at counsel’s request, has passed, and Thomas has failed to\ntimely file a motion to dismiss.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022073.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page ll of 34\ndated April l, 2o2o, explaining that any responsive information in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>\nand subject to disclosure had already been produced.

Applicable Law\n\nA. Brady & Giglio\n\nThe Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely\ndisclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. See\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972); see also\nUnited States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l39-4o (2d Cir. 2ool). Evidence is “material” in this sense\nonly if “its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome ofa trial.” United States v. Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 678 (l985). “The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all\nthe evidence in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> which might conceivably assist the preparation of\nhis defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only\nknoun to the Government.” United States v.

Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 6o4 (2d Cir. l973)).\n\nImpeachment evidence is material only “where the witness at issue supplied the only\nevidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness’s\ncredibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution’s case.” United States v.\nPayne, 63 F.3d l2oo, l2lo (2d Cir. l995) (internal quotation marks and citations omited).\nSimilarly, “where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to\nchallenge a witness whose credibility has already been shoun to be questionable or is subject to\nextensive atack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as\ncumulative, and hence not material.” United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, ll (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit,\nin Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022075.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l3 of 34\ndemand for it. 267 F.3d at l46. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do\nnot require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant’s request. Jd. It\nfound that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence\nas well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order\ndisclosure of material it deems material as a mater of case management.

The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy\nits discovery and disclosure obligations.\n\nThe Government has met its Rule l6 discovery and disclosure obligations. As set forth\nabove, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among\nother things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2ol9 (despite the fact\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022076.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l4 of 34\nthat the Indictment relates to a l4-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and\nstaffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone\nrecords; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of writen\nBureau of Prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and\nwhile not required by Rule l6, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and nou,\napproximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the\ninvestigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants\ndisclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them.\n\nThe Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio\nobligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> that is arguably\nexculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or\natorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the\nGovernment intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in\nadvance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant’s motion\nshould be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. l9 Cr. l23-2 (NRB), 2o2o WL l8o9293, at\n*5 (S.D.N.Y.

There is no basis to compel production of evidence\nrelated to those maters under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because\nthe evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent atempt at nullification. Thomas’s motion\nshould be denied on this basis alone.\n\nC. The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who\n\nWere Not Part of the Prosecution Team\n\nThomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce “any reports, witness\nstatements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the\nBOP,” “documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC\nemployees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” and any previously undisclosed\nreports, witness statements, and documents created by “any other federal agencies that investigated\nthe circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein.” (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)).

Applicable Law\n\nAs described above, Rule l6, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government’s\n“<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>.” As a general mater, while “[a]n individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have\nknouledge of all information gathered in connection with his office’s investigation of the\ncase, .. . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does\nnot in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge to the prosecutor.” United States v.\nAvellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations omited). The imposition of such “an\nunlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor’s office\non the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government’\nthat would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.” Jd.

Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 437 (l995) (Government’s\ndiscovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor\nor “others acting on the government’s behalf in the case”). Thus, discovery and disclosure\nobligations only extend “information knoun to persons who are a part of the ‘prosecution\nteam’ ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of\nthe case,” including “police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the\nprosecutor and participate in the investigation.” United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App’x 36, 38 (2d\nCir. 2ol5) (citation omited). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information\nin the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of third parties on behalf of the defense. See United States v.

Thomas seeks materials\nthat are not in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the United States Atorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI\nand DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.\n\nThomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the\nprosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic\ndecisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the\nMCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and writen\nrequests to the MCC’s legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any\ninternal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide. Notwithstanding\nthose facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the\nGovernment’s discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is setled law in this\nCircuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody, or\ncontrol of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint\ninvestigation” with that agency. None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022087.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 25 of 34\nGovernment; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel\naccompanied the prosecution to court proceedings.\n\nMoreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into\nthe events of August 9 and lo, 2ol9 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe\nthat most if not all of the records that he seeks—such as records of other instances of BOP\nemployees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP’s investigation. There\nis simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case,\nregarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct\nrequired rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other\ntimes also allegedly falsified records.\n\nThe cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the\nNinth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents\nlocated in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS\ninvestigation. 868 F.2d lo32, lo35-37 (9th Cir. l989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit\nexplained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might\nhave documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule l6’s disclosure requirements are cabined\nto anything in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the\ndefendant.” /d. at lo36 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d\n2o4, 22l (E.D.N.Y. l999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that\n“TcJourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrouly to mean the prosecutors in the\nparticular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant,\nand not the ‘government’ in general.” And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022091.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 29 of 34\ndiscovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022098.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page 2of9\nPrisons (the “BOP”)] as to both [D]efendants, including[] any and all supporting memorandums,\nwriten statements, photos, videos, and incident reports,” id. at 6; and (3) “any and all reports,\nmemorandums, writen statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured, or\npossessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies[] participating in the investigation of the\n[D]efendants, allied with the prosecution, and to which the prosecution has access,” id. at 7.\n\nFor the reasons stated belou, Thomas’ motion is DENIED.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Government has already produced “surveillance video going back to July 5,\n\n2ol9. ..; count slips, thirty minute round forms, and staffing rosters for the three-week period\nsurrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone records; employee files and staffing history\nfor Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of writen [BOP] policies and regulations,” as well as\n“statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the investigation.” Gov’t Opp. at 8-9,\nECF No. 35.\n\nThomas argues that he is entitled to additional discovery on two grounds: (l) Rule l6 of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and (2) the constitutional guarantee of due process as\nexpressed by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v.

Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l,\nlo9 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (internal quotation marks and citation omited), abrogated on other grounds\nby Carpenter v. United States, l38 S.

Control has been defined to include\nthe legal right to obtain the documents requested upon demand. The term ‘control’ is broadly\nconstrued.” United States v. Stein, 488 F.

United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28,\n34 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5).\n\nB. Brady/Giglio\n\nUnder the Supreme Court’s decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government “has a\nconstitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material\nto guilt or punishment,” and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to\n“not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key\n[GJovernment witness.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool). “Evidence is\nmaterial within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the\nevidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Turner v.\nUnited States, l37 S. Ct. l885, l893 (2ol7) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration\nomited)); see also Coppa, 267 F.3d at l35 (“[T]he prosecutor must disclose evidence if, without\nsuch disclosure, a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome of a trial in which the\nevidence had been disclosed would have been different.”).\n\n“The prosecution’s obligation to disclose Brady material extends to any material in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of any entity that has acted as an ‘arm of the prosecutor’ in a given case.” United\nStates v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36, 2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8)\n(quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 736, 74l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8)). “A\nprosecutor’s duty to review documents in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, custody, or control of another agency\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22loo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022101.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page5of9\narises where the Government conducts a joint investigation with another agency.” United States\nv. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomited). In determining whether the prosecution has conducted a joint investigation, courts in\nthis district look to a number of non-exhaustive factors, “including whether the other agency: (l)\nparticipated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to\nthe grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution,\n(4) played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the\nprosecution to court proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nAs under Rule l6, if the Government has represented that it is aware of and has complied\nwith its Brady and Giglio obligations, a defendant must make a “particularized shouing that\nmaterials exist requiring disclosure” in order to sustain a motion to compel. United States v.\nJuliano, No. 99 Cr. ll97, 2ooo WL 64o644, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l8, 2ooo); see United States v.\nEvanchik, 4l3 F.2d 95o, 953 (2d Cir. l969) (“[T]he assurance by the [G]overnment that it has in\nits <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> no undisclosed evidence that would tend to exculpate defendant justifies the denial\nof a motion for inspection that does not make some particularized shouing of materiality and\nusefulness.”)\n\nIl. Inspector General Materials\n\nThomas seeks disclosure of both the investigatory materials from the Department of\nJustice Office of the Inspector General’s (“OIG”) investigation regarding Epstein’s death, and a\ndraft of the Inspector General’s report arising from that investigation. Motion at 5. The\nGovernment concedes that atorneys from OIG participated in the Government’s investigation\nthat led to the indictment of Thomas. Gov’t Opp. at 3, l9.

Thomas has not identified any specific material that might be in OIG’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> that has not been disclosed.\n\nThe Court, therefore, has no basis to compel the Government to disclose additional\nevidence underlying the Inspector General’s report. “[C]ourts in this circuit have repeatedly\ndenied requests for discovery orders where the [G]overnment represents that it has produced\ndiscovery to defendants pursuant to Rule l6 and has made a good faith representation to the\ndefense that it recognizes and has complied with its obligations under Brady and its progeny.”\nUnited States v.

Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998)).\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the BOP is DENIED.\n\nIV. Other Materials\n\nFinally, Thomas seeks disclosure of information that he argues will tend to shou that the\nconduct for which he is being prosecuted was: “l) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with\nknouledge and acquiescence by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies\nthat forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is nou being charged criminally,\nand; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory application of BOP policies\nby [G]overnment prosecutors.” Motion at 7.

United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 468 (l996). “[A] defendant\nwho seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must shou some evidence of both\ndiscriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.” United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863\n(2oo2). Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of\nfalse count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submited false documents in\nother circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in\nany protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.\nSee Motion at lo. Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his\nprosecution.\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the\nsubmission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery\nrelated to selective prosecution, is DENIED.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is\ndirected to terminate the motion at ECF No. 33.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: June 9, 2o2o O}-\nNew York, New York ——XNALISA TORRES\n9 United States District Judge\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22lo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022166.jpg": "MER, ORES\nAg NN di mit AAG U.S. Department of Justice\nad ee a c lta I “i j Federal Bureau of Investigation\n“igs aot el?\n\nAs part of our commitment to transparency, the Department of Justice and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation have conducted an exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to\nJeffrey Epstein. To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of child pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not\nuncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nConsistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is\nintertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and\nlikenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.\n\nOne of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bringing justice to\nvictims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\n\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information\nregarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span>, it is\nthe determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia knew who had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that ““we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n255 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York. BOP emails reflect that other atorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Atorney with\nthe BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because atorneys had to wait hours or were unable to\n2 As discussed in Chapter l, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York\nstaff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological atention, shouers, and recreation.\n\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023494.jpg": "ae Office of the Atortiey General\n~ February 27,:2o25.\nDear Director Patel,\n\nBefore you came into. office, I requested the full and complete files related’ to Jeffrey\nEpstein.

When this approval is granted, the inmate is placed\non the “out count” and will be required to remain in the\nvisiting room until the count has been completed. Inmates who\nhave not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal\nvisits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:3o p.m. and\n9:3o a.m. Atorneys who arrive at the institution within an\nhour before the start of a count, i-.e., after 3:oo p.m. or 9:oo\na.m., will not be able to visit their client until after the\ncount clears,\nCounts usually take approximately 3o-4o minutes to clear. During\nthis time, all movement in the institution ceases. Conseguently,\natorneys and/or their representatives will not be alloued to\nenter or exit the Visiting Room during official counts. Visits\nshould be scheduled accordingly to avoid unnecessary delays.\nBy Identification\nTo receive atorney entrance privileges, an individual must he\nable to establish his or her status as an atorney by presenting\nidentification that verifies active membership in any state bar.\nExcluding Legal Aid Society Federal Defender’s, NY State\nAtorneys are required to have a Secure Pass Identification card\nfor entrance. Upon notification that a NY State atorney is not\nin <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a Secure Pass, and upon approval from the Legal\nDepartment, atorneys will be permited to enter the institution\nfor 65o days from their date of approval without the Secure Pass.\nIf an atorney is licensed in a state other than New York,\nhe/she must contact the legal department at least 24 hours in\nadvance so that their status as an atorney in good standing may\nbe verified. Provided the Legal Department can verify the\natorney’s status, the atorney will be added on a list located\nin the lobby, authorizing the atorney’s entrance for a one year\nPage 4 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23747", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023749.jpg": "opening of the box. Larger packages may be broken doun into\nseveral smalier envelopes. These boxes are emptied Monday-\nFriday, excluding federal holidays, and the contents are\nprocessed with other mail received from the post office that\nday. Envelopes must be ciearly marked with the atorney’s name\n(including language that identifies that person as an atorney),\ninmate’s name and register number and the follouing statement:\n“SPECIAL MAIL-OPEN ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE INMATE.” See\nbelou, page l2. Unauthorized items found in the inmate’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> will be treated as contraband.\nTape Players, VCRs & Computers to Review Discovery Material\nDue to security concerns, atorneys may not bring electronic\neguipment into the secure confines of the institution. Houever,\nMCC New York has tape players, VCRs and televisions for\natorneys to review discovery materials with clients in visiting\nrooms. These items are available on a first come, first served\nbasis by oral request to the visiting room officer.\nMCC New York also has a computer that atorneys may use to\nreview computer CDs with their clients. The computer is\navailable during atorney visiting hours and should he reserved\nat least 24 hours in advance by calling the Legal Department.\nAtorneys who make an appointment to use the computer will have\npreference over those who do not make an appointment. Atorneys\nshould bring a copy of the CD discovery when meeting with an\ninmate.\nAudio and video cassetes and CDs may also be mailed directly to\nan inmate via the legal mail procedures explained belou in the\nLegal Mail section, Cl. Inmates may review their DVD and CD-Rom\ndiscovery material as described in the Law Library Section, El.\nDs Private Conference Rooms\nThese rooms are available on a first come, first served basis.\nThere are twelve conference rooms in the building. Institutioral\nsecurity and fire safety reqduilations restrict the total number\nof people that may be in the visiting room at any one time.\nUltimately, it is a correctional decision where any visit will\ntake place.\n6. Multipie Client Visits\nAtorneys are not limited in the number of inmates they may\nvisit in one day. Houever, only one inmate may be brought doun\nto the visiting room at any time. Please see belou in\nSeparation/Codefendant Meeting Section ll for instruction on Co-\nDefendant Meetings. When an atorney has finashed the legal\nvisit and the inmate has been sent back to the unit, another\ninmate may be brought doun to the visiting room.\nPage 6 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23749", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023763.jpg": "This can be accomplished by placing the empty botle on the daily\npill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least\nonce a day. If medical staff feel that an inmate should not he\nin <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of certain medications they need (certain\npsychiatric medications), the inmate will be administered the\nmedication by pharmacy during daily pill line.\n4. Independent Medical Examinations (IME)\nIf an atorney seeks a court order for an IME, the follouing\ninformation must be included:\n{l) Inmate’s name and register number;\n(2) A court order or similar court signea document for the\nexamination;\n(3) A provision for time and date to be determined by all\naffected parties;\n(4) Expected length of examination;\n{5) Name, title, and organization of each person atending\n(all-non atorneys and non-legal representatives will\nhave to fill out an application so MCC can complete a\nbackground check (See Atachment B);\n(6) List of all equipment to be used; and\n(7) An indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been\nobtained.\nAll of the above should be faxed to the Legal Department who will\nmake arrangements with the medical department for a convenient\ntime and date. The physician entering will be subject to using\nthe equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also\nhave to complete Atachment B.\n2 Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital\nAll USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will\nbe referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.\nI. Special Housing Unit (SHU)\nMCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general\npopulation. The SHU consists of two categories of cells:\nadministrative detention and disciplinary segregation.\nDisciplinary Segregation Status. A form of separation from the\ngeneral population in which inmates who commit serious violations\nof Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nfor specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general\npopulation. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary\nsegregation upon determining that no other available disposition\nwill adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence\nnecessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable\nlimits.\nPage 2o of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024163.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nMedical Duty Status\nReg #: 763l8-o54 innate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD\nHousing Status\n___ confined to the living quarters except _ meals __pilline __ treatments Exp.

County Road ,\nPalm Beach, FL 3348o\nRe: Epstein mater 3\nDear Detective Recarey:\n. I am sending you this leter in response to the serious concern you raised at our\nmeeting regarding an alleged claim that one of our investigators had misrepresented\nhimself as a police officer and in fact had actually atempted to impersonate you. As I\ntold-you neither I nor my client would ever tolerate any such conduct on the part of our\n| investigators. With that in mind, I immediately began an inquiry of our staff, and believe\nl * that the contemporaneous notes taken by our investigator, while atempting to interview\n: EEE Wi!) provide. the necessary explanation for your thoroughly justified\nconsternation. . It will also, I believe, provide a more troublesome and telling illustration\nof her character.

The Police Report and Probable\nCause Affidavits detail information purportedly obtained by Detective Recarey\nfrom Juan Alessi, a former Epstein house manager. The statement was recorded by\na stenographer. A comparison of the transcript and the Police Report and Probable\nCause Affidavits reveal significant differences. Detective Recarey reports that\n“Alessi stated that touards the end of his employment, the masseuses were\nyounger and younger”. (Police Report at 57). Alessi actually stated that for the\nmost part the masseuses did not appear young. (Transcript at 9).

This statement is\ndirectly contradicted by other witness statements, which are devoid of any\n\n| accusation by any woman that any activity ever occurred on the bed. Indeed,\nAlessi himself actually stated that on a “few” occasions the bed was unmade after\na massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (Transcript at ll-l2). Alessi\nfurther explained that even in the absence of a massage he could be called upon to\nmake Epstein’s bed three or four times a day, (id), thus providing an innocent\nexplanation for the frequent bed making. It was in fact Detective Recarey who\nsuggested that “something else occurred”, and even then, Alessi insisted he did not\nknou of “something else”: “. . . or something else, I cannot [say]”. (/d.).\n\nThere is also no mention of Alessi’s burglary of the Epstein residence; his\ntheft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi’s suicidal ideations, all of\nwhich made him an unreliable witness.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 2277 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR- ooo3259o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032592.jpg": "Professional Standards Unit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nJanuary __, 2oo7\nPage 7\ninitially saying he would be present, Detective Recarey failed to atend or to send\na substitute.\nIl.

No record evidence suggests that\nprosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what\nwas spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests\non mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the\ndiscovery on the NPA. In any case, it appears that\nthe Government has already produced two of the\ndocuments Maxwell seeks in her motion—the OPR\nreport and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of\ncourse, the Government’s disclosure obligations would\nrequire it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evi-\ndence or evidence material to preparing the defense,\nincluding any evidence supporting a defense under the\nNPA.

Accordingly, although the Court\nconcludes that Maxwell is not entitled to expedite this\ndiscovery based on the arguments in her motion\npapers, the Court will require the parties to confer on\nan overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\nA.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia knew who had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had <span class=\"highlight\">possession</span> of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nI. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.
