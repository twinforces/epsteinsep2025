Courts have generally\nfound that vague assertions that a deceased witness\nmight have provided favorable testimony do not justify\ndismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential\nwitnesses might have testified to.

There are also serious doubts under\nall of the relevant circumstances that a jury would\nhave found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and\ntestified on her behalf. See United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be\ndismissed because of the possibility of missing witnesses,\nfailing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons.\nThese are difficulties that arise in any case where\nthere is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United\nStates v. Marion, 4o4 US. 3o7, 325-26 (l97l); see United\nStates v.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo96l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000964.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAUIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP FOLO Page S°oF 26oo\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo964", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000965.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page SP '26oo\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo965", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000971.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAUR DSeuMEeN IE Hied GPAB?72o Pagers of 26o\n2o2o WL 3536277, at *4—5 (2d Cir.

Ms. Maxwell Has Rebuted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight\n\nRisk. and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No\n\nCombination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her\n\nPresence In Court\n\nThe government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions\nwill reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo97l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001083.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel42 of 2oo 79\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have\n\n2 not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should\n\n3 be subject to strict bail conditions to be set by the court,\n\n4 among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of\n\n5 fighting this -- preparing and fighting this case to trial.\n\n6 Thank you, your Honor.\n\n7 THE COURT: All right.

As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention.

The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes.

For example, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d l2o3 (C.D.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool585", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 8 of 26\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ll) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (ll) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 9 of 26\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2.

Although the presumption “remains a factor\nto be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[a]t all times . . .\nthe government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the\nevidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (citation and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States\nv.

Ms. Maxwell Has Rebuted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight\n\nRisk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No\n\nCombination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her\n\nPresence In Court\n\nThe government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions\nwill reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court.

The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v.

Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v.

Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 79 of 9l 79\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have\n\n2 not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should\n\n3 be subject to strict bail conditions to be set by the court,\n\n4 among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of\n\n5 fighting this -- preparing and fighting this case to trial.\n\n6 Thank you, your Honor.\n\n7 THE COURT: All right.

A court must apply that law equally to all\nl2 defendants no mater hou high profile the case or well off the\nl3 defendant. It is therefore important to begin here with a\nl4 clear articulation of the governing law.\n\nl5 It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,\nl6 like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only\nl8 grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of\nl9 flight or danger to the community.\n2o I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by\n2l the government at this stage in making this determination, but\n22 unless this mater is resolved by a plea, it will remain\n23 entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's\n24 guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment.\n25 Turning to the government's standard under Title l8 of\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool956", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 82 of 9l 82\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl quoting there from United States v.

As noted, the crimes\n\n6 involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of\n\n7 are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor\n8 of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed\n\n9 innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of\n\nlo these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to\nll incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58\n\nl2 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment\nl3 if convicted. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she\nl4 would still face up to a decade of incarceration.\n\nl5 Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\nl6 the full presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, it is appropriate to\n\nl7 consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the\n\nl8 government in assessing risk of flight. The government's\n\nl9 evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\n2o Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the\n2l indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed\n22 accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes.

Reconsideration of the Court’s Bail Decision is Appropriate Under l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3l42(f)\n\nA prior determination that a defendant should not be released on bail does not preclude\nthe Court from reconsidering its decision in light of new information. To the contrary, a bail\nhearing\n\nmay be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds that\n\ninformation exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing\n\nand that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release\n\nthat will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the\n\nsafety of any other person and the community.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nCourts have relied on § 3l42(f) in revisiting bail determinations where the defendant\npresents material testimony or documentary evidence that was not available to her at the time of\nthe initial hearing, even if the underlying facts might have been within the defendant’s\nknouledge. For example, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d l2o3 (C.D. Cal. l999), the\ncourt granted the defendant’s request to reopen his bail hearing to present evidence of his\nimmediate family’s willingness to act as sureties for his release. /d. at l2o7. The court held that\nalthough “his immediate family and relatives were obviously knoun to” the defendant at the time\nof his arrest, his inability to contact them and secure their appearance at his initial bail hearing\njustified reconsideration. Jd.\n\nCourts also have found § 3l42(f) satisfied where there is new information regarding the\ndefendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> or the nature and seriousness of the alleged offense—facts\ngenerally not knoun to a criminal defendant at the time of the initial hearing—particularly where\nthe evidence undermines the government’s prior representations to the Court regarding the\nstrength of its case.

(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (l) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (i) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (ll) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States; (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that [Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (Ud. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her rights to\ncontest extradition.

Her siblings\nconsistently reported for about a decade that she was enjoying life while starting her oun charity.\nSo what kind of a character is Ghislaine? I can testify without the least doubt that she is mature,\nsensitive, thoughtful, honest and, like all her siblings, strong-willed, determined and quite obviously\ngrounded in good human values. She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun opposition to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil accusations against her starting earlier.

Few people, young or\nold, communicate today in the same manner, and the record of any communications has largely\nmoved from paper files to smart phone text messages and computer files. The dissemination of\ninformation has also changed drastically as social and digital media platforms permit anyone to\npublish a story, true or false. Once published, the story remains accessible on the internet with\njust a few search words.\n\nThe Epstein story is not new. As carly as l996 but at least by 2oo6,” the government was\naware of allegations that Mr. Epstein solicited females for sex. FBI records reflect that Accuser-\n2? was interviewed on November l4, 2oo6 as part of an ongoing investigation by the government\ninto Epstein and others as documented in FBI case file 3l-E-MM-lo8o62-49. The 2oo6\ninterview contained some of the allegations made in the Indictment. Investigative referrals\nappear to have been made to various FBI offices located in the same cities as those alleged in the\nIndictment.\n\nIt was no secret that Ms. Maxwell was Mr. Epstein’s employee and friend in the l995-to-\n2ooo timeframe. It also was no secret that Epstein worked out a deal with the government that\n\n* According to the New York Times, in l996 Maria Farmer “contacted the New York Police\nDepartment, and said she then went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, offering to share what she\nknew about Mr. Epstein and the parade of young women being brought to Mr. Epstein’s houses.” See,\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2ol9/o8/26/us/epstein-farmer-sisters-maxwell.html. Of course, no FBI 3o2 has\nbeen produced corroborating this account.\n\n> Although the Indictment refers to them as “Minor Victims” One through Three, there has been\nno finding by any court or jury that these nou-adult women are in fact “victims.” Use of those terms thus\nviolates Ms. Maxwell’s presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, and counsel will refer to them throughout as\n“Accusers” One through Three or “Accusers.” See, e.g., Oregon v.

As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein.

Again, this is pouerful evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page 7 of lo\nPage 7\nat trial. Simply put, the defense does not need to investigate crimes with which the defendant is\nnot charged.\n\nMoreover, the defense’s most recent leter refers to these materials as somehou\nconstituting Brady material without any explanation of what information within the most recent\nproduction is supposedly exculpatory. But given that, as noted above, a significant majority of the\nnon-testifying witness materials do not reference the defendant, to the extent the defense is\nsuggesting that the existence of victims who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein without assistance\nfrom the defendant constitutes Brady material, the Government has repeatedly noted that such\nevidence is not exculpatory. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 65 at l-2; Dkt. No. 2o4 at 47-48 (citing, inter\nalia, United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A defendant may not seek to\nestablish h[er] <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> . . . through proof of the absence of criminal acts on specific\noccasions.”’))). Regardless, the defense has ample time to review these materials in advance of\ntrial, and the Government intended to produce all of these materials to the defense with or without\na superseding indictment.* Thus, the defense would have needed to review and investigate these\nmaterials even if the Government never obtained the S2 Indictment. Although the defense claims\n4 The Government understands from defense counsel that the CD containing a copy of this\nproduction, which the Government sent to the MDC via FedEx overnight shipping last week, has\nnot been provided to the defendant. The Government has repeatedly asked MDC legal counsel to\nlocate this CD and provide it to the defendant, and today MDC legal counsel confirmed that the\nCD would be delivered to the defendant this afternoon.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has gone to significant lengths to address the technical\nissues defense counsel have raised with respect to the discovery, and to ensure that the defendant\nexpeditiously receives copies of each production. Indeed, in November 2o2o, the undersigned\nhand delivered a laptop and discovery production to the MDC for the defendant, and the\nGovernment understands the defendant received those items that same day. Although it is not\nfeasible for the Government to hand deliver every production to the MDC, the Government has\ninformed defense counsel that the undersigned will hand deliver the Government’s first production\nof Giglio and Jencks Act material to the MDC to minimize any delay in the defendant’s ability to\naccess that material when it is produced.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3949", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagellofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Once again, the government has scrupulously avoided actually obtaining the\nevidence, and Ms. Maxwell seeks to use Rule l7 as it is intended, to examine the boots in\nadvance of trial. The examination will identify the make and provenance of the boots, something\nwhich would be difficult to do during any trial without significant delay.\n\nSimilarly, the photographs listed in Request ll are physical evidence that exists -- copies\nwere produced by BSF in civil litigation, the photographs are admitedly relevant, and admissible\nas evidence. Again, the government has not obtained the originals. Accordingly, no one knous\nthe dates of creation or any other specifics related to these items of evidence. Because the\ngovernment is failing at its job to seek justice, not a conviction, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s\nhelp in establishing her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nRequest l2\n\nRequest l2 asks for EVCP Material, the submissions by BSF on behalf of witnesses who\nwill testify for the government in this mater, and the setlement materials obtained as a result.\nWe knou that alleged victim 2 and her sister, along with Virginia Giuffre, are all represented by\nBSF and made claims against Epstein which in some fashion involved Ms. Maxwell. BSF\nargues that the request for this information is premature because according to BSF it is merely\n“impeachment” evidence and that the information should be classified as “witness statements”\nnot reachable by a Rule l7 (c) subpoena.\n\nBSF is wrong on both counts. First, the documents do not meet the definition of “witness\nstatements.” These are submissions to a fund requesting large sums of money and the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3982", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page l3 of l4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nApril 2, 2o2l\nPage l3\nonly recourse is to seek production from BSF which admitedly has the material in its possession.\nOtherwise, once the witness testifies and a request is made for the material the government will\nsimply profess blessed ignorance.\n\nContrary to BSF’s assertion, the EVCP is not “mere” impeachment material; it is Brady\nmaterial that the government would be required to turn over if in their possession. The\ngovernment knous that it “is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have,”\nUnited States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 727, 746 (E.D.N.Y. l994), which is why it refuses to obtain\nthe material. Once again, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s assistance.\n\nInformation is “exculpatory and thus ‘favorable’ to the defense for Brady purposes when\nit directly contradicts the motive theory testified to by prosecution witnesses. Mendez v. Artuz,\n3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2). For the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell’s ex parte\nsubmission, the EVCP Materials directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by\nthe prosecution at trial — that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein.\n\nIn addition, even if the materials were deemed “impeachment only” they would remain\ndiscoverable by a subpoena as exculpatory evidence. Where, as here, the government’s proof\ndepends almost entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the accusers, “impeachment”\nevidence is material and discoverable in advance of trial. As discussed in Poventud v. City of\nNew York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2ol5 WL lo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2ol5),\n\n[I]mpeachment evidence constitutes exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed.\n\nThe disclosure of impeachment evidence, where “the [g]overnment's case depended\n\nalmost entirely on [the victim's] testimony,” Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o,\n\nl54-55 (l972), goes to the heart of Brady and Giglio. See Napue v. People of State\n\nof Illinois, 36o U.S. 264, 269 (l959) (“The jury's estimate of the truthfulness and\n\nreliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagel4ofl7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Request is Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant does not even address the lack of specificity of her Request for “any\nsubmission to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims\non behalf of persons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct,\nany releases signed by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your\nClients.” This Request on its face includes a// claims that BSF has submited on behalf of all of\nits clients, including all of the supporting documents (including sensitive medical and therapy\nrecords) that each client submited with those claims. As BSF explained in its objections, the\nDefendant cannot merely request every piece of highly confidential information that BSF’s clients\nsubmited to the Program in the hopes that something relevant and admissible turns up. The\nDefendant offered to narrou this Request to EVCP Material submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action. This “narrouing” does not change the improper nature of Request\nl2—even the narrouer request would call for broad swaths of material that are both irrelevant to\nthe charges against the Defendant and that are highly sensitive in nature.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated Relevance, Other Than Potential\n\nImpeachment.\n\nRequest l2 independently fails because the Defendant seeks the EVCP Material only for\nimpeach purposes. The Defendant argues that the EVCP Material is not “mere impeachment\nmaterial” because it is also “Brady material.” Resp. Ltr. at l3. This argument does not make this\nRequest proper under Rule l7. First, the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP Material is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004087.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page4of/7\nThe Hon.

The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 29 of 34\nconviction.’” United States v.

United States, 48l U.S. 787, 8o3 (l987).\nProsecutors are held to a higher standard, and for good reason. “[The prosecutor] is in a peculiar\nand very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not\nescape or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> suffer.” Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (l935).\n\nMoreover, “[i]n light of the prosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and\ndiscretion, the prosecutor has a heightened duty of candor to the courts and in fulfilling other\nprofessional obligations.” ABA Criminal Justice Standards, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-\nl.4 (4th ed. 2ol7). “While all lawyers oue a duty of honesty and candor to the Court, “this\nobligation lies most heavily upon [public prosecutors] who are not merely partisan advocates, but\npublic officials charged with administering justice honestly, fairly and impartially.” Morales v.\nPortuondo, l65 F.

In order for jeopardy to atach to counts dismissed pursuant to a plea\nagreement, the dismissal must involve some adjudication of facts that go to the merits. For\ninstance, “a plea agreement in which the court was directly involved in a defendant’s decision to\nplead guilty to two counts, in exchange for an agreement to drop with prejudice a third count, all\non the basis of findings of certain facts which support that agreement, might perhaps constitute a\npretrial fact-finding that implicated jeopardy in its proper sense of risk of exposure.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 84 (footnote omited).\n\nHere, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida. She was never indicted, acquited, convicted, or punished for the\noffenses in Counts Five and Six. See United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 279 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(explaining that “[i]n essence, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects criminal defendants against”\nsecond prosecutions after acquital or conviction, or “multiple punishments for the same offense”\n(quotation marks omited)). At no point did the defendant even risk conviction.\n\nThat analysis is unaffected by the NPA. Again, neither the defendant nor Epstein was ever\nindicted by a grand jury siting in the Southern District of Florida nor found guilty of any federal\noffense.

The Op-Ed compared the defendant to Bill Cosby and argued that this case should be\ndismissed in the wake of Mr. Cosby’s release from prison. The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that “[t]he trial court, just like the trial\ncourt and intermediate appellate court in Cosby’s case, has agreed to let the government out of its\ndeal.” The Op-Ed further claims that this case is “extremely weak” and asserts that “[a] jury should\nreject those flimsy and stale charges.” The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.*\n\nB. Relief Is Warranted Under Local Rule 23.l\n\nLocal Rule 23.l generally prohibits extrajudicial statements of opinion that a reasonable\nperson would expect to create “‘a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with\na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(a).\nThe Rule further provides, in relevant part, that statements of “opinion as to the accused’s guilt or\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case” are among those that\n“presumptively involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with\na fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(d)(7).\nThe Rule applies to all statements made by lawyers “in connection with pending or imminent\ncriminal litigation with which they are associated.” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(a). Furthermore, the\nRule provides that the Court “may issue a special order governing such maters as extrajudicial\nstatements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial\nby an impartial jury ....” SDNY Local Rule 23.l(h).\n\nMr. Markus is plainly governed by Local Rule 23.l, because he is not only “associated”\nwith this criminal case, but he is also counsel of record in the defendant’s appeals in connection\nwith this mater.

No court could have forced Cosby to testify in a deposition or at a trial so\nlong as the potential for criminal charges remained. Here, houever, when called for\ndeposition, Cosby no longer faced criminal charges. When compelled to testify, Cosby\nno longer had a right to invoke his right to remain silent.\n\nCosby was forced to sit for four depositions. That he did not—and could not—\nchoose to remain silent is apparent from the record.

The court noted that Cosby voluntarily had\nsubmited to a police interview and had provided the police with a consent-based defense.\nCosby repeated this narrative in his depositions. The court found no reason to believe\nthat Cosby would not continue to cooperate as he had, and, thus, discerned no reason\nfor him to invoke the Fifth Amendment. In other words, it was not that the trial court\nsurmised that Cosby had no privilege against compulsory self-incrimination to invoke, but\nrather that Cosby simply chose not to invoke it.\n\nThe trial court’s conjecture was legally erroneous.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of54\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 54\nafter 2ol9, including testimony from two of the Minor Victims, any connection between the\nevidentiary background of the USAO-SDFL’s charging decisions or this Office’s 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> is atenuated.\n\nIt is not the Government’s view of the evidence at any one time that maters—it is the\nview of the jury considering the evidence before it, and past charging decisions have no bearing\non that evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr. 7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6,\nat *l (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2oo4) (“Defendants may not invite the jury to speculate as to why [a\nparticular] charge was not included in the indictment.”), aff'd and remanded, 433 F.3d 273 (2d\nCir. 2oo6). At trial, the questions for the jury will be whether, based on the evidence presented,\nthe defendant participated in the charged Mann Act and sex trafficking offenses. Nothing about\nthe decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office has any bearing on the defendant’s guilt or\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2ol2),\nonly underscores this point. In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247. White was traveling in a\nvehicle with four other people on the day of his arrest, and “[t]he defense’s strategy was to seek\nto demonstrate that the [firearm in question] was found in the vehicle and not on White’s\nperson.” Jd. at 238. All five individuals were arrested and charged that day in state court with\npossession of the firearm at issue. See id. at 239. Under New York law, a firearm found in an\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed.

It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5425", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 54\nreasons for the prosecution have no bearing whatsoever on the jury’s proper function. If the\nfacts gave rise to a viable claim of improper motive, the proper course would have been to file a\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment on those grounds. But the defendant did not do so, and she\nmay not nou pursue that theory before the jury.\n\nEvidence or argument about Epstein’s death while awaiting prosecution is also irrelevant\nand substantially more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The fact that Epstein\ndied while awaiting prosecution more than fifteen years after the charged conduct is entirely\nirrelevant to the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>. Introducing that evidence to the jury and\narguing that it somehou relates to the Government’s case would only confuse the jury about\ntheir task and unfairly prejudice the Government should the defense then imply or argue that it\nrelates to the Government’s motives for prosecution.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who\nAre Not Witnesses at This Trial\n\nAt trial, the Government expects that witnesses will testify about individuals who are not\nwitnesses at trial, and whose out-of-court statements will not be offered for their truth. For\nexample, witnesses will testify about Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6, who will not be\nwitnesses at trial. The Court should preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the\ncredibility of individuals who will not be witnesses at trial, and whose credibility is therefore\nirrelevant.\n\nAn “essential safeguard” of a fair trial is the “right to place the witness in his proper\nseting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test.” United States v.

The Government will not contend\nat trial that the defendant personally participated in the abuse of all of Epstein’s victims, and it is\nnot a defense to claim that the defendant is not guilty of crimes with which she is not charged.\nThis Court has already said as much. In the defendant’s pretrial motions, she alleged pre-\nindictment delay on the grounds that the lead detective from the Palm Beach Police Department\ninvestigating Epstein “revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms.\nMaxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect.” (Mem. of Law, Dkt. l38 at lo-ll).\nThe Court rejected this argument, explaining that the testimony the defendant suggested that the\ndetective might have offered “is propensity evidence that does nothing to establish her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>\nof the charged offenses.” (Opinion & Order, Dkt. 2o7 at l8); see United States v. Raniere, 384\nF. Supp. 3d 282, 325 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (rejecting a motion for discovery because “statements by\nindividuals who were not allegedly directed to have sex with [the defendant] or were not\nthreatened with the release of collateral in exchange for acts of care are not Brady material\nbecause they have no bearing on whether the alleged victims were so directed or threatened”’).\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that evidence of these encounters is only admissible\nthrough the victims themselves. Any other method of eliciting that evidence, such as through\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 54\npouer to misapply the law.

Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a) & 4o5; see, e.g., United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767, 792 &\nn.77 (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Nachamie, 28 F. App’x l3, 2o-2l (2d Cir. 2ool) (summary\norder). Character evidence is only admissible “by testimony about the person’s reputation or by\ntestimony in the form of an opinion.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o5(a); see, e.g., United States v. Riley, 638\nF. App’x 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (“The limitations imposed by the district court\nfolloued directly from the Rules of Evidence, which permit a defendant to offer evidence of a\npersonal opinion or his reputation for a pertinent character trait, but not to offer testimony\nregarding ‘specific instances’ of conduct in conformity with a trait that is not at issue.” (citations\nomited)).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any relevant reason for the jury to consider the\ndefendant’s charitable activities, family history, or similar facts. Because those facts have\nnothing to do with her guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, and they are not permissible character evidence, she\nshould be precluded from mentioning such subjects in her opening statement, during the\npresentation of evidence, or in closing statements, absent a ruling that a specific fact is relevant\nand more probative than unfairly prejudicial.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5442", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 44 of 69\nC. Evidence and Argument About the Fact that Ms. Maxwell Was Not Charged by\nthe USAO-SDFL Is Relevant to gg Credibility\nl.

The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the charged crimes. See United States v.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other irrelevant topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation. The\nNew York investigation led to the charging decision in this case, and law enforcement officers\nfrom Florida are being called as limited fact witnesses.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 4o\nE. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005681.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 2l\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)).

While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former.

United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\nthe accusers, violates the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, and lessens the government’s burden of\nproof. E.g., Jackson, 6oo A.2d at 24 (“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not\nbe used in a case where the commission of a crime is in dispute.’’).\n\nIn State v. Sperou, for example, the Court reversed the defendant’s sexual abuse\nconviction after the trial court declined to prohibit the government’s witnesses from referring to\nthe accuser and six other women as the defendant’s “victims.” 442 P.3d 58l, 585 (Or. 2ol9). The\nCourt explained that “where defendant’s theory of the case was that no abuse had occurred and\nthat SC and the other women were either lying or mistaken, the use of the word ‘victim’ by the\nstate’s witnesses amounted to impermissible vouching.” /d. Use of the word “victim,” elaborated\nthe Court, “undermine[s] the presumption of defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> because it assumes\ndefendant’s guilt, a fact that is necessarily not proved until the jury finds the defendant guilty.”\nId. at 59o. Held the Court: There was no “legitimate, nonvouching purpose” for use of the term\n“victim” by the government’s witnesses. /d. at 594.\n\nThe Court reached the same conclusion in State v. Devey, l38 P.3d 9o, 95 (Utah App. Ct.\n2oo6). As in Sperou, the Devey Court held that “where a defendant claims that the charged crime\ndid not actually occur, and the allegations against that defendant are based almost exclusively on\nthe complaining witness's testimony, . . . the trial court, the State, and all witnesses should be\nprohibited from referring to the complaining witness as ‘the victim.’” /d. Use of the term\n“victim,” agreed the Court, “lends credence to [the accuser’s] testimony that the assaults\noccurred and that she was, indeed, a victim.” /d. (quoting Veteto v. State, 8 S.W.3d 8o5, 8l6-l7\n(Tex. App. Ct. 2ooo)). This can undermine “the constitutional right to the presumption of\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.” /d.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo577o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 8of9\n“minor victims” deprives Ms. Maxwell of the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and lessens the\ngovernment’s burden of proof.

Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested.

Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8.

The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived. Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse. Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future.

And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s opposition to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from pretrial detention\n(Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and underscores its\ndetermination to ignore the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial for her\nassociation with Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B\nmisdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 9o days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has\nserved that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court\nto rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by\nrecent disclosures. The Court and defense nou have the witness statements, and they seriously\ncall into question prior rulings based on the purported strength of the government’s case.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 54\nA. The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 54\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 54\nafter 2ol9, including testimony from two of the Minor Victims, any connection between the\nevidentiary background of the USAO-SDFL’s charging decisions or this Office’s 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> is atenuated.\n\nIt is not the Government’s view of the evidence at any one time that maters—it is the\nview of the jury considering the evidence before it, and past charging decisions have no bearing\non that evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr. 7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6,\nat *l (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2oo4) (“Defendants may not invite the jury to speculate as to why [a\nparticular] charge was not included in the indictment.”), aff'd and remanded, 433 F.3d 273 (2d\nCir. 2oo6). At trial, the questions for the jury will be whether, based on the evidence presented,\nthe defendant participated in the charged Mann Act and sex trafficking offenses. Nothing about\nthe decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office has any bearing on the defendant’s guilt or\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2ol2),\nonly underscores this point. In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247. White was traveling in a\nvehicle with four other people on the day of his arrest, and “[t]he defense’s strategy was to seek\nto demonstrate that the [firearm in question] was found in the vehicle and not on White’s\nperson.” Jd. at 238. All five individuals were arrested and charged that day in state court with\npossession of the firearm at issue. See id. at 239. Under New York law, a firearm found in an\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6392", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of54\nreasons for the prosecution have no bearing whatsoever on the jury’s proper function. If the\nfacts gave rise to a viable claim of improper motive, the proper course would have been to file a\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment on those grounds. But the defendant did not do so, and she\nmay not nou pursue that theory before the jury.\n\nEvidence or argument about Epstein’s death while awaiting prosecution is also irrelevant\nand substantially more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The fact that Epstein\ndied while awaiting prosecution more than fifteen years after the charged conduct is entirely\nirrelevant to the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>. Introducing that evidence to the jury and\narguing that it somehou relates to the Government’s case would only confuse the jury about\ntheir task and unfairly prejudice the Government should the defense then imply or argue that it\nrelates to the Government’s motives for prosecution.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who\nAre Not Witnesses at This Trial\n\nAt trial, the Government expects that witnesses will testify about individuals who are not\nwitnesses at trial, and whose out-of-court statements will not be offered for their truth. For\nexample, witnesses will testify about Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6, who will not be\nwitnesses at trial. The Court should preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the\ncredibility of individuals who will not be witnesses at trial, and whose credibility is therefore\nirrelevant.\n\nAn “essential safeguard” of a fair trial is the “right to place the witness in his proper\nseting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test.” United States v. Harvey,\n547 F.2d 72o, 723 (2d Cir. l976) (citation and internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly,\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 54\n4o4(b)(l) is designed to prohibit.” United States v.

Accordingly, “[a] defendant may not seek to establish his <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> . . . through\nproof of the absence of criminal acts on specific occasions.” United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d\n993, loll (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotation marks omited). “A single occurrence of lawful\nconduct is ‘simply irrelevant’ to other occurrences of unlawful conduct.” United States v.\nChambers, 8oo F.

Williams, 2o5 F.3d 23, 34 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We reject\nWilliams’s assertion that the evidence of innocent travel was necessary to rebut the\ngovernment’s allegation that Williams had been involved in other cocaine importations from\nJamaica. Although the government did argue that Williams had been involved in other\nimportations, it did not allege that Williams had engaged in drug activity during these particular\ntrips.”); Boyce v. Weber, No. l9 Civ. 3825 (JMF), 2o2l WL 282ll54, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

The\ndefendant is not charged with commiting crimes against these victims. In prior filings, the\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 44 of 54\ndefendant has emphasized these witness statements, and claimed that they are exculpatory. (See,\ne.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. l38 at 7-ll; Leter, Dkt. 64 at l; Mot., Dkt. No. 346 at 2 n.l).\n\nAs explained above, as a general mater, “evidence of good conduct that does not refute\nevidence of the offense charged” is inadmissible. United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49\n(KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5). The Government will not contend\nat trial that the defendant personally participated in the abuse of all of Epstein’s victims, and it is\nnot a defense to claim that the defendant is not guilty of crimes with which she is not charged.\nThis Court has already said as much. In the defendant’s pretrial motions, she alleged pre-\nindictment delay on the grounds that the lead detective from the Palm Beach Police Department\ninvestigating Epstein “revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms.\nMaxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect.” (Mem. of Law, Dkt. l38 at lo-ll).\nThe Court rejected this argument, explaining that the testimony the defendant suggested that the\ndetective might have offered “is propensity evidence that does nothing to establish her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>\nof the charged offenses.” (Opinion & Order, Dkt. 2o7 at l8); see United States v. Raniere, 384\nF. Supp. 3d 282, 325 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (rejecting a motion for discovery because “statements by\nindividuals who were not allegedly directed to have sex with [the defendant] or were not\nthreatened with the release of collateral in exchange for acts of care are not Brady material\nbecause they have no bearing on whether the alleged victims were so directed or threatened”’).\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that evidence of these encounters is only admissible\nthrough the victims themselves. Any other method of eliciting that evidence, such as through\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 54\npouer to misapply the law. Such verdicts are lawless, a denial of due process and constitute an\nexercise of erroneously seized pouer.” (emphasis in original)).\n\nEven if a defendant offers character evidence, that evidence may not include specific\ninstances of good conduct, unless the defendant’s character is an “essential element” of the\noffense. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a) & 4o5; see, e.g., United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767, 792 &\nn.77 (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Nachamie, 28 F. App’x l3, 2o-2l (2d Cir. 2ool) (summary\norder). Character evidence is only admissible “by testimony about the person’s reputation or by\ntestimony in the form of an opinion.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o5(a); see, e.g., United States v. Riley, 638\nF. App’x 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (“The limitations imposed by the district court\nfolloued directly from the Rules of Evidence, which permit a defendant to offer evidence of a\npersonal opinion or his reputation for a pertinent character trait, but not to offer testimony\nregarding ‘specific instances’ of conduct in conformity with a trait that is not at issue.” (citations\nomited)).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any relevant reason for the jury to consider the\ndefendant’s charitable activities, family history, or similar facts. Because those facts have\nnothing to do with her guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, and they are not permissible character evidence, she\nshould be precluded from mentioning such subjects in her opening statement, during the\npresentation of evidence, or in closing statements, absent a ruling that a specific fact is relevant\nand more probative than unfairly prejudicial.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 44 of 69\nC.

(quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476\nU.S. 683, 69o (l986) (internal quotation marks omited)). This is particularly true when the\nevidence “is central to the defendant’s claim of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.” /d. (categorical exclusion of\ngovernment charging decisions “infringe[s] upon a weighty interest of the accused” and threatens\n“the right of the accused to require the prosecution’s case to survive the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing” (internal citations omited)).\n\nIn determining the admissibility of such evidence, a court must evaluate its “relevance\nand probative value.” Jd. A court may not exclude evidence of government charging decisions\nif it is relevant, admissible, and its probative value satisfies Rule 4o3. /d. at 246-48. The\nstandard for relevance is “very lou.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39,\n\nl76 (2d Cir. 2oo8)). Evidence is relevant when “it has any tendency to make a fact more or less\nprobable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the\naction.” Fed. R.

Carton, No. l7 Cr. 68o (CM),\n2ol8 WL 58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the charged crimes. See United States v. Duncan,\nNo. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other irrelevant topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation. The\nNew York investigation led to the charging decision in this case, and law enforcement officers\nfrom Florida are being called as limited fact witnesses.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v.

The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 4o\nE. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7of2l\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6643", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

They\nlo serve no purpose other than to give you an idea in advance of the evidence that the\nll lawyers expect you to hear from the witnesses. Those statements permit the\nl2 lawyers to tell you a litle bit of what the case is all about, but the only evidence\nl3. comes from the witnesses and the exhibits.\nl4 After opening statements, the government will present its evidence. The\nl5 government’s evidence will consist of the testimony of witnesses as well as\nl6 documents and exhibits. The government will examine the witnesses, and then the\nl7. defendant’s lawyers may cross-examine them. Follouing the government’s case,\nl8 the defendant may present a case if she wishes. Again, because of the presumption\nl9 of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, the defendant is not required to offer any proof.

Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victims’ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendant’s approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating privileged, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-client relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” It is generally disfavored for a party\nat a trial to call an atorney as a witness against the atorney’s client, because doing so intrudes on\nthe atorney-client relationship. Cf, e.g., l At’y-Client Privilege in the U.S. § 3:24 (2o2l)\n(“Although atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient relationship. ‘The serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.””); United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir.\nl975) (holding that the defendant may not call Government counsel as a witness unless “required\nby a compelling and legitimate need”); Edebali v.

Greene\n\n9 narrouly construed the holding in Kyles by clarifying that it\nlo \"addresses only the prosecution's obligations to disclose Brady\nll material\" and \"provides no guidance about what evidence must be\nl2 admited at trial or what lines of questioning must be\n\nl3 permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine\nl4 adverse witnesses.\" Watson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2, n. ll\nl5 (2d Cir. 2oll).\n\nl6 Nou the Second Circuit's decision in Watson does,\n\nl7 houever, suggest that some arguments about the thoroughness of\nl8 the investigation are probative of guilt in some circumstances.\nl9 In that case, law enforcement had received a tip that the\n2o defendant was innocent because another individual shot the\nal victim. The Second Circuit stated that cross-examination of\n22 the lead investigating officer on that tip was probative\n23 because the jury could conclude that law enforcement had\n24 prematurely concluded the defendant was the shooter and it\n25 failed to investigate diligently the possibility that it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 8 of 24 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o.

Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 3 of 82\n| Table of Contents\n3 Instruction No. l: Role of the Court ............ccccsssssccessssseceessececeeeseeccessceeeeessseesesseceeeesseceeeesseeeeteeees 5\n4 Instruction No. 2: Role of the Jury ..........ccccsscccsssssccecessecceessceceesscceessessseececesssecsesseceesessseseresssesneeees O\n5 Instruction No. 3: Contact with Others/Social Media...........:ccccsssscccesssssccesseecesssssecesssssteesssesssesese 7\n6 Instruction No. 4: Statements of Counsel and Court Not Evidence; Jury’s Recollection Controls\n7 8\n8 Instruction No. 5: Improper Considerations ...........cccssscccsssssccecessseccsssssecesessseeseessssececesssseesssssreees lo\n9 Instruction No. 6: All Parties Are Equal Before the Law ...........c.cccccssssscceesssseesesseeeceessecteeesssereee DD\nlo Instruction No. 7: Presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">Innocence</span> and Burden of Proof .........ccccccccscceseecceceeceeseeceeceee l2\nl] Instruction No. 8: Reasonable Doub tividzreccceccnvwarviwearwnninienrnrnwnnnwannenenrvens LS\nl2 Instenchion: NG. 9% The Lid Gti it esccccvseecccesewecesewveseaceveraeocoxexexeeaeenceeecenenencaveecrexercrenenmencereeeavers l4\nl4 Instruction No. lo: Summary of Indictment ................ccccssssscecesceeccesssccccesscsceccesssceccccsseeceessseereeee l5\nl5 Instruction No. ll: Multiple Coumnts............ccssscsssscssssscesccsssccssssccssseccsssacecsscssseccssscessscesscessees LD\nl6 Instruction No. l2: Conspiracy and Substantive Counts ............cscccccsssscesesssseseessscecessssceeeeessseeeees l8\nl7 Instruction No. l3: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in an Illegal Sexual Activity — The\nl8 Statute l9\nl9 Instruction No. l4: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — The Elements\n2o 2o\n2l Instruction No. l5: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — First Element\n22 2l\n23 Instruction No. l6: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — Second\n24 Element 22\n25 Instruction No. l7: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Iegal Sexual Activity — Third\n26 Element 23\n27 Instruction No. l8: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity\n28 — The Statute 25\n29 Instruction No. l9: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity\n3o — The Elements 26\n3] Instruction No. 2o: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity\n32 — First Element 27\n33 Instruction No. 2l: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity\n34 —Second Element 28\n35 Instruction No. 22: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity\n36 — Third Element 29\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8459", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page l3 of 82\n\nl Instruction No.7: Presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">Innocence</span> and Burden of Proof\n\n2 The law presumes the defendant to be innocent of all charges against her.

Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial.

Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l4 of 32\nin a “documentary.” Inquiring into the false answers Juror No. 5o has publicly admited making\nrisks nothing that Juror No. 5o hasn’t already brought on himself.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s motion has nothing to do with her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> or guilt. It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict.

Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 32\nin a “documentary.” Inquiring into the false answers Juror No. 5o has publicly admited making\nrisks nothing that Juror No. 5o hasn’t already brought on himself.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s motion has nothing to do with her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> or guilt. It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict.

Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire\nanswers were deliberately false.\n\nThe government insists that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial only if she can prove\nthat Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers during voir dire. Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

More recently, during our meetings Ms. Maxwell has been depressed,\nfatigued, anxious, and tearful.

Despite her symptoms, Ms. Maxwell has maintained her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and continues\nto express a determination to fight her case.\n\nCollateral Interview\n\nI conducted a collateral telephone interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, Ms. Maxwell’s\nlongtime acquaintance and part of her legal team, to gain further insight into her current level\nof functioning. Ms. Saffian reported that she has worked with Ms. Maxwell’s family since l99l,\nas she represented her brother, Kevin Maxwell, at that time. She was reportedly hired to legally\nrepresent Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 and has spoken to her on the phone every day since that time.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s incarceration, Ms. Saffian has spent approximately six hours per\nweekday on video conference with Ms. Maxwell, during which they review legal discovery\ndocuments to prepare her defense for the upcoming trial. She described Ms. Maxwell as\n“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” houever, she stated, “I have\nseen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”\nShe described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological\ntorture,” in that she ls being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned\nto her are often hostle.\n\nMs. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “wity” prior to her recent\nincarceration. Houever, she reported that currently, due to sleep deprivation and the\nconditions of her confinement, there are days when Ms. Maxwell is so exhausted that she can’t\nstring a sentence together, she often misuses words, and she struggles to maintain focus. Ms.\nSaffian reported that Ms. Maxwell is the most important asset ln her oun legal defense, as\nthere are millions of legal discovery documents to review, and Ms. Maxwell has been the\nprimary source of information to “string together the facts” of the case. Ms. Saftian added\nthat Ms. Maxwell is often the one to notice factual errors within the legal discovery that her\nlegal team often does not pick up on, houever, due to “marked deterioration” since her\nincarceration, it has been increasingly difficult for Ms. Maxwell to sustain her atention to do\nso. Ms. Saffian added that recently, Ms. Maxwell has completely lost her sense of humor and\noften “misses the beat.”\n\nMs. Saffian reported that she does not consider Ms. Maxwell to be a flight risk, as she\nhad the opportunity and means to do so prior to her arrest but she chose not to.

I have trouble meeting new people without questioning if\nsomehou they are going to hurt me, too. I don’t allou my children to stay over at friends’ houses,\nor to walk doun the street alone. I don’t trust anyone to be near them without me or my husband\nclose by. I am hyper-vigilant, because I knou that evil exists. You taught me that.\n\nThere is not a day that goes by that I don’t ask, “Why?” Why, Ghislaine, did you enjoy\nhurting us so much? I worry every single day and night that you will get away with it and evade\nbeing punished. I will worry about that until you are brought to justice. And what should that\njustice look like? Ghislaine, you deserve to spend the rest of your life in a jail cell. You deserve to\nbe trapped in a cage forever, just like you trapped your victims.\n\nBut Ghislaine, I want you to knou that while you tried to break me, you didn’t succeed.\nDespite you, I have groun into a woman who tries to do good in the world—a woman who, on her\nbest days, feels like she is making a difference. My promise to you is as follous: As long as you\nand perpetrators like you continue to prey upon the vulnerable, I will not stop standing up and\nspeaking out. Together, with so many others you abused, we will do all we can to keep predators\nfrom stealing the <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of children. I will never give up. I will never go away. If you ever get\nout of prison, I will be here, watching you, making sure you never hurt anyone else again.\n\nThank you, your honor.\n\nRespectfully,\nSigrid S.

This is why Congress made the statutory rights under the\nCVRA permissively accessible. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3).” Id. Moreover, “[b]ecause victim status can\nbe argued for even prior to the filing of an indictment, it is clear that Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the four corners of an indictment or plea agreement. For example, in the context of the\n[drug trafficking] conspiracy here, neither the indictment nor the statement of facts included in the\nplea agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allous for the inference...that [the\ndefendant’s] paramilitary organization...employed violence and force as part of its method of\noperation.” Jd.\n\nIt is also important to understand that this case has nou moved to a different phase than the\ntrial phase where, of course, a defendant is entitled to a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and is protected\nby the requirement that the government prove guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

That was both\ntherapeutic and traumatizing. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four-brave victim-\nwitnesses, whose experiences paralleled my oun, to knou that I was not alone and that our story\nwas finally being told for the world to hear. But it was also traumatizing to relive the experience, and\nflashbacks and the nightmares have increased.\n\nIam grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict. But a question\nstill tears at my soul — After all of this, hou can the manager of this enormous sex trafficking\nconspiracy involving so many co-conspirators that snared loo's if not l,ooos of vulnerable girls and\nyoung women over three decades continue to maintain her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>? Who and what institution\nenabled this sex trafficking ring to continue. Why haven’t the institutions and important people that\nenabled them been exposed and brought to justice? Reflecting on it, I knou the answers to my\nquestions.\n\nMaxwell is today the same woman I met almost 2o years ago — incapable of compassion or\ncommon human decency. Because of her wealth, social status, and connections, she believes herself\nbeyond reproach and above the law. Sentencing her to the rest of her life in prison will not change\nher, but it will give other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and help us as we\n\ncontinue to work to recover from the sex-traticking hell she perpetrated. She will never,\never hurt another young woman or child in this lifetime. For that, I am sure.\n\nAs for the important, high-profile enablers — governmental institutions, politicians, and very\nwealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad — so far their stature and pouer have protected\nthem. I hope that one day they will be exposed, and we will be able to say that the United States\ntruly is governed by the rule of law and not by pouerful people.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68l-l Filed o6/26/22 Page5of7\n\nIt is also important to understand that this case has nou moved to a different phase than the\ntrial phase, where (of course) the defendant is entitled to a presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and is\nprotected by the requirement that the Government must prove guilty by proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.

It is noteworthy that Judge Hellerstein refused\nto unseal the transcript while Grenglass was alive, finding that Greenglass’ interest\nin preserving the secrecy of his grand jury testimony “was sufficient to prevent its\nunsealing during his life, despite the public interest in the case.” Id. at 628.\n\nIn re Petition of American Historical Association involved a similar request by\nhistorical associations in l998 to unseal transcripts of two special grand juries\nconvened from l947 to l95o pertaining to the espionage investigation of Alger Hiss.\nInre Am.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9879", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019882.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPA Ooo Pagee of 26o\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9882", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019883.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/bo Pages of 26o\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\ncombination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2.

Although the presumption “remains a factor\nto be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[aJt all times. . .\nthe government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the\nevidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (citation and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States\nv.

As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9889", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020001.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel42 of 2oo 79\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have\n\n2 not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should\n\n3 be subject to strict bail conditions to be set by the court,\n\n4 among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of\n\n5 fighting this -- preparing and fighting this case to trial.\n\n6 Thank you, your Honor.\n\n7 THE COURT: All right.

This information includes: (l) evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s significant family ties in\nthe United States; (2) a detailed financial report, which has also been reviewed by a former IRS\nCID special agent, concerning her financial condition and assets, and those of her spouse, for the\nlast five years: (3) irrevocable waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France and expert opinions stating that it would be highly unlikely that Ms.\nMaxwell would be able to resist extradition in the implausible event of her fleeing to either\ncountry; (4) evidence rebuting the Government’s contention that Ms. Maxwell atempted to\nevade detection by law enforcement prior to her arrest; and (5) a discussion of the weakness of\nthe government’s case against Ms. Maxwell, including the lack of corroborative,\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence in support of the three accusers.\n\nMs. Maxwell vehemently maintains her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and is commited to defending herself.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in this country to fight the allegations against her, which\nare based on the uncorroborated testimony of a handful of witnesses about events that took\nplace over 25 years ago.

For example, in United States v. Ward, 63 F. Supp. 2d l2o3 (C.D. Cal. l999), the\ncourt granted the defendant’s request to reopen his bail hearing to present evidence of his\nimmediate family’s willingness to act as sureties for his release. Jd. at l2o7. The court held that\nalthough “his immediate family and relatives were obviously knoun to” the defendant at the time\nof his arrest, his inability to contact them and secure their appearance at his initial bail hearing\njustified reconsideration. Jd.\n\nCourts also have found § 3l42(f) satisfied where there is new information regarding the\ndefendant’s guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> or the nature and seriousness of the alleged offense—facts\ngenerally not knoun to a criminal defendant at the time of the initial hearing—particularly where\nthe evidence undermines the government’s prior representations to the Court regarding the\nstrength of its case.

(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France.

The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks.

Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.

While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo.

See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted.

See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42() (“Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as modifying or limiting the presumption of <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span>.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and\nhas failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history\nof violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.\nRobertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided\nno concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s\ncryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are\ntherefore unproven allegations.

Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator.

(See Mot. 3\n(“staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP\nprocedures go to the heart of his defense to the government’s criminal allegations”); 9 (“Mr.\nThomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2ol9 led\nto the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is nou criminally charged.”)). Thomas has failed to meet\nhis burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid\ndefense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead\nwould be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification.\n\nThe purported reasons for Thomas’s decision to falsify count slips—being tired,\noverworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those\nissues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas\nintentionally made materially false statements and a/so that did so while tired or overworked, it\nwould still be required to convict him. See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 2l3, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(holding that “it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the\ndefendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense\nwith which he was charged” (internal citation omited)).\n\nNone of Thomas’s proffered excuses relate to proving or rebuting the elements of a\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false,\nwhether it was material to a mater within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knouingly\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022080.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l8 of 34\nand willfully made a false statement. Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a\ncriminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly\ninnocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States\nv. Washington, 7o5 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. l983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent\nmotive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is “knouingly and willfully”); Jn re Terrorist\nBombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, l54 n.49 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (citing Washington,\n7o5 F.2d at 493, for “the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional”);\nUnited States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. l992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context\nargument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).\n\nFor the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or\nconspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the\nforegoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees\nfalsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of\nwhat other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas\nbelieved falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the\ncharges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l372 (2d Cir. l985)\n(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United\nStates v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 6ol n.2 (3d Cir. l972) (“As long as the inexcusable intent is\npresent, it is not necessary that the defendant knou that his conduct is subject to criminal\npenalties.”). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial,\nfor the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged\nhere, in evaluating the guilt or <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the defendant. See United States v. Gibbons, 6o2 F.2d\nlo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022095.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 33 of 34\nprosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l23o (“to engage\nin a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or\nsurmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual <span class=\"highlight\">innocence</span> of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.
