Maxwell, No. l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Daily News, L.P., <span class=\"highlight\">publisher</span> of the New York Daily News, to\nrespectfully join in the requests of The Miami Herald, The New York Times, ABC News, and\nNBC News to unseal the motion for new trial and supporting exhibits filed by the Defendant in\nthis case, to unseal Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, and to unseal the juror questionnaires for the\nl2 seated jurors.!\n\nAs the Court is aware, the public and the press have a presumptive First Amendment and\ncommon law right of access to criminal proceedings and records. See Press Enterprise Co. v.\nSuperior Court of California, 464 U.S. 5ol, 5o8 (l984) (“Press Enterprise I’). The presumption\nof openness can only be overcome if “specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating\nthat closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that\ninterest.” Press—Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, l3-l4 (l986) (“Press-Enterprise\nIl’). Under this standard, the presumption in favor of access to court proceedings and records\nrequires \"the most compelling circumstances\" to justify any restriction upon that right. In re\nApplication of Nat'l B'casting Co., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o).\n\nThe reasons why the documents in question should be unsealed have been clearly set\nforth in the submissions by the other media entities. The Daily News would simply emphasize\nthat the right of access applies fully to post-trial proceedings, including motions for a new trial\nand accompanying exhibits and memoranda. See, e.g., United States v. Donato, 7l4 F. App’x\n75, 76 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (concluding that documents atached to motion for a new\ntrial were judicial documents subject to right of access and holding that district court abused its\ndiscretion in refusing to unseal documents); United States v. Gonzalez, 927 F. Supp. 768, 784\n(D. Del. l996) (“the public, through its surrogate, the press, has a right of access to the post-trial\nbriefs and appendix filed in support of defendant’s Motion for a New Trial’’); United States v.\n\n' Non-parties such as the Daily News have standing to intervene in criminal proceedings to assert\nthe public’s right of access. United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo884l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009475.jpg": "Case D28erBo68 PAE UNBotamMentl6l6622 o lRildd@ 82lG4A/ 22 ag Pagef36 of ll7\nA-587l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 29 of 29\n- Stephen Gillers\nl4o. “Bush Postpones 2oo8 Election,” The Nation, August l4/2l, 2oo6 (satire).\nl4l. “Free the Ulysses Two: Joyce’s First U.S. Publishers Were Convicted of Obscenity.

I am a JD graduate of the Univ. of Pennsylvania Law School and an\nMS graduate of the Univ. of California Santa Cruz in counseling psychology. For the past 27 years I\nhave practiced psychotherapy, first for Bute County's Division of Youth and Adult Services from\nl995-2oll and then since then I've run my oun private practice here in Santa Cruz, CA. I have never\ntreated Ghislaine Maxwell professionally, Rather, I am writing this as a long-time close friend of the\nwhole Maxwell family including Ghislaine.\n\nMy father, Dr. Herbert Hollomon, met Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine's father, in the mid-l95os because\nmy father was a major research science manager at General Electric Co and Maxwell was by then\nalready a major <span class=\"highlight\">publisher</span> of world science. Apart from earlier whole family stays with the Maxwells in\nthe early 6os, my parents sent me back to Oxford for an entire summer for work experience and to stay\nwith the Maxwell family in l966 - Ghislaine was 5. I returned again in l98o for more work experience\nthat summer and returned multiple times in later years to see the siblings and her mother Bety after\n\ni\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo49o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015217.jpg": "Federal Trade Commission, l976-77\n\nBay Area Rapid Transit, San Francisco, l979\n\nU.S. Department of Justice (National Crime Survey), l98o\n\nConsultant for atorneys and other members of the legal profession in 34 US states,\n\nCanada, South Korea, Israel, Sweden, Japan, The Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland, Portugal\n\nLaw Reform Commission of Canada, l98l\n\nWestin Hotels, AT&T, Schering-Plough, L.A.

Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun <span class=\"highlight\">publisher</span>, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies —\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate.
