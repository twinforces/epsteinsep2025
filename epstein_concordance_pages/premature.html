Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page lof5\nrN U.S. Department of Justice\nNSF United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ltr.”), requesting that the Court order the\nGovernment to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses ll months prior to trial, and\nrequesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> given that the production of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page_lof4 a\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: “x\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:_8/25/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant.

These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n! Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997. (Def. Ltr. 3-4).

This is particularly so when weighed against the\nrisks of early production to the Government’s ongoing investigation.\n\nBy contrast, the Government has met its burden under Rule l6(d)(l) by explaining why\nthe requested delay is necessary and hou the Government would be prejudiced by the immediate\nproduction of the Materials. In particular, the proposed delay will allou the Government to\ncontinue its investigation into conduct outside the period charged in the Indictment without\nrevealing to the defendant the identities of the witnesses in that investigation. The <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\nrevelation of this information would give the defendant the opportunity to interfere with the\nGovernment’s investigation before it is complete. Such information could allou her to contact\nand intimidate witnesses, destroy evidence relevant to the investigation, or alert other targets of\nthe investigation. Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when\nit has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming\nforward to assist in the Government’s investigation. Allouing the delayed production of these\nmaterials would permit the Government to complete its investigation without interference while\nstill giving the defense everything it is asking for well in advance of trial.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\nGovernment’s request to delay disclosure of these Materials.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v.

In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make.

Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly.

If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 239\ndismiss those charges improperly asks the Court to adjudicate her guilt.

Among other reasons, courts look to “the record as a whole in determining whether\nan indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until trial is\ncomplete. United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo9). Additionally, because\ndouble jeopardy is meant to protect a defendant from successive punishments for the same offense,\na multiplicitous count does not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See\nJosephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long\nas no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).\n\nFollouing the Second Circuit’s directive, courts in this Circuit regularly defer ruling on a\nmultiplicity motion until after the conclusion of trial.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One or Three of the Indictment as multiplicitous\nis, at best, <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit, this Court should defer\nruling on this motion until after the completion of trial. The additional time will ensure that the\nfull factual record is developed before the Court conducts the multiplicity analysis, and the motion\nmay become moot depending on the jury’s verdict.\n\nFirst, the Court cannot conduct the multiplicity analysis before hearing all of the evidence\nregarding the charges contained in the Indictment. Prior to trial, the record will not be fully\ndeveloped, and the Court cannot conduct the necessary analysis to determine whether the counts\nare in fact multiplicitous. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit and the consistent\npractice in this District, the Court should defer conducting any multiplicity analysis until after\nhearing all of the evidence at trial. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355.\n\nSecond, the motion may become moot because it is possible that the jury could conclude\nthat the defendant is guilty of one of the charged conspiracies but not guilty of the other. That is\nbecause each charged conspiracy alleges that the defendant agreed to violate a different criminal\nstatute. Count One alleges that the defendant agreed to transport minors with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts. Count Three alleges that the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 239\nwith the intent that they engage in illegal sex acts. In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at\n\nl73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 239\n\n355 (“It is well established that ‘[w]hether to prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury are decisions that generally rest in the prosecutor’s discretion,’ and ‘a defendant has no\nconstitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his\nindictment and prosecution... .”” (brackets and ellipses in original) (quoting United States v.\nBatchelder, 442 U.S. ll4, l24 (l979)).\n\nOnly after the Court has heard all of the evidence at trial and received the jury’s verdict\nwill the defense motion be ripe.

Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nFirst, the defendant moves for a bill of particulars, demanding the Government set out an\narray of details regarding the Government’s theory of its case and anticipated witness testimony.\nThe defendant, like all defendants, is entitled to sufficient information to understand the charges\nagainst her, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy. Houever, the\nGovernment has provided such information, and much more, in the Indictment, extensive\ndiscovery, and various pretrial filings, including this memorandum.

During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had jomed Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003676.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 34\nrelated to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\ndiscovery.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\n6 Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\n® Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the Sl superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3676\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3696\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 (2d\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\n\nThe government does not dispute that Counts l and 3 charge Ms. Maxwell with the same\ncrime, conspiracy in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l, nor that the charges are based on identical\nfacts. Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the\nmotion is “<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>,” focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell\nwere convicted on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell atendant to the\novercharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until\n“after the completion of trial” which will “ensure” a full factual record. Resp. at l72. The\ngovernment is wrong.\n\nThe Court can, and should, grant this Motion, direct the government to elect which of the\nconspiracy charges it will prosecute, and dismiss the other. The identical facts are plainly alleged\nin the superseding indictment (“Indictment”), and the government has presented no factual\ndistinction in its response. Accordingly, no additional record is necessary and very clear\nauthority exists supporting the relief requested by Ms. Maxwell, dismissal of one of the\nmultiplicitous counts. “District courts presented with what are recognized before or during trial\nto be multiplicitous indictments will avoid any problem by requiring the prosecution to elect\nbetween counts charged rather than by merging the counts at sentencing.” United States v.\nPolizzi, 257 F.R.D. 33, 36-37 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9). The Court should order such an election and\ndismissal here.\n\nI. The Motion is Not <span class=\"highlight\">Premature</span>, and the Court has Discretion to Direct Election\nand Dismissal Pretrial\n\nThe government’s “prematurity” argument is misplaced. Pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l2(b)(3)(B)(i), a defendant is required to raise arguments based\non defects in the indictment, including “charging the same offense in more than one count\n(multiplicity),” by pretrial motion “if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page7of8\nThe Hon.

Ms. Maxwell should not be required to expend considerable time\nand resources obtaining relevant exculpatory evidence that could have been seized or\nsubpoenaed by the government. <span class=\"highlight\">Premature</span> disclosure of the evidence would impinge on Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights to effective assistance of counsel and reveal defense strategy and work\nproduct.\n\nRule l6, not Rule l7, governs the timing of any reciprocal discovery request, and it\nprovides that if a defendant requests disclosure from the government under Rule l6(a)(l)(E),\nthen upon compliance with a similar request by the government, the defendant is required to\npermit the government to inspect and copy or photograph documents and tangible objects\nwhich are within the possession, custody or control of the defendant and which the defendant\nintends to introduce at trial.

Any Protective Order Regarding the Rule l7 Material Should Be Separate\nfrom the Protective Order Entered at the Insistence of the Government and Over Ms.\nMaxwell’s Objection\n\nThe government has repeatedly objected to any modification of the Protective Order\nentered in this case.?

Once again, the government has scrupulously avoided actually obtaining the\nevidence, and Ms. Maxwell seeks to use Rule l7 as it is intended, to examine the boots in\nadvance of trial. The examination will identify the make and provenance of the boots, something\nwhich would be difficult to do during any trial without significant delay.\n\nSimilarly, the photographs listed in Request ll are physical evidence that exists -- copies\nwere produced by BSF in civil litigation, the photographs are admitedly relevant, and admissible\nas evidence. Again, the government has not obtained the originals. Accordingly, no one knous\nthe dates of creation or any other specifics related to these items of evidence. Because the\ngovernment is failing at its job to seek justice, not a conviction, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s\nhelp in establishing her innocence.\n\nRequest l2\n\nRequest l2 asks for EVCP Material, the submissions by BSF on behalf of witnesses who\nwill testify for the government in this mater, and the setlement materials obtained as a result.\nWe knou that alleged victim 2 and her sister, along with Virginia Giuffre, are all represented by\nBSF and made claims against Epstein which in some fashion involved Ms. Maxwell. BSF\nargues that the request for this information is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> because according to BSF it is merely\n“impeachment” evidence and that the information should be classified as “witness statements”\nnot reachable by a Rule l7 (c) subpoena.\n\nBSF is wrong on both counts. First, the documents do not meet the definition of “witness\nstatements.” These are submissions to a fund requesting large sums of money and the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l  Page6of9\njury subpoena at issue in Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that\nproduction suggests coordination between the Government and BSF. Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them. This Court knous well that the Government has not always lived up to those\nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good\nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum,\nnone of Maxwell’s theories justify production of these documents under the Rule l7(c) process.\n\nRequest l2, which seeks “‘any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation\nProgram made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks\n“any” submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell\noffered to narrou this request to just those materials submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action.\n\nThe request’s failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of\nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this\nrequest, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submited to the EVCP.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004205.jpg": "Casask 2olG-GN89aPARWsP asyeuMneAePss AritecheAensl pdgage df afil2\nand (c) facts demonstrating that the burden and expense of the discovery is justified by the needs\nof this case.

May 25, 2oo6).\n\nThis guideline makes sense because a “moving party must not only justify those\ndepositions it wishes to take, but also the depositions it has already taken.” /d. (citing Barrou v.\nGreenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2o2 F.R.D. 48o, 482 (N.D.Tex. 2ool)). This rule is in place because\n“a party could indirectly circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum alloted\nnumber to those that she could not justify under the Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek{[ ]\nleave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate.” Jd. at 483.\n\nHere, Plaintiff seeks a pre-emptive determination that she should be permited l7\ndepositions, almost twice the presumptive limit, yet her proposed depositions are not calculated\nto lead to admissible evidence in this case. By way of example, Plaintiff identifies Nadia\nMarcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or Sarah Vickers), and Jeffrey Epstein as\nalleged “co-conspirators” with each other. She requests the depositions of each. Plaintiff\nanticipates each will invoke the Fifth Amendment — in other words, she will not obtain any\ndiscoverable information from them.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagel2oofl4\nil. At Minimum, the Government Must Demonstrate the Admissibility of Evidence\n\nRegarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R.

Ms. Maxwell notes, houever, that the government’s\nargument that such evidence is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) suffers from the same\nflaws as its argument that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions regarding Accuser-3 constitute an overt\nact.\n\nThe government claims Accuser-3’s testimony is admissible to shou Ms. Maxwell’s\n“knouledge, intent, and modus operandi.” Opp. l58 (emphasis in original). The government’s\nvery use of those terms, houever, betrays an implication that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with\nAccuser-3 were somehou unlawful. Any knouledge or intent on Ms. Maxwell’s part that\nEpstein would engage in consensual sexual activity with Accuser-3, or any method by which she\npurportedly persuaded Accuser-3 to engage in such lawful conduct, has no bearing on whether\nMs. Maxwell knew or intended Accuser-l or Accuser-2 to engage in unlawful sexual activity.\nAnd Accuser-3’s proffered testimony about her “subjective experience” of her lawful,\nconsensual activity with Epstein certainly would not inform the jury as to Ms. Maxwell’s state of\nmind or conduct with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Ms. Maxwell is prepared to brief these\nissues more fully in connection with her evidentiary motions.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 7 ofl3\nPage 7\n\n“<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” because the defense had not yet decided whether to call the expert and explaining that\n“Tallouing [the] defendant to defer the provision of such discovery until a final determination\nregarding whether or not [to] put an expert witness on the stand would seem to frustrate” the goal\nof allouing the Government a fair opportunity to prepare).

During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, ““Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.*8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 26\nas multiplicitous remains <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>.

Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o of 26\npractice.”); United States v. Drago, No. l8 Cr. o394 (SJF) (AYS), 2ol9 WL 3o72288, at *2\n(E.D.N.Y. July l5, 2ol9) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay\nwithout prejudice to renewal).\n\nBecause the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of\nunconstitutional delay, let alone both, her motion to dismiss the $2 Indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay is meritless and should be denied.\n\nV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count\nThree as Multiplicitous Is <span class=\"highlight\">Premature</span>\n\nThe defendant moves to dismiss Counts One, Three, or Five on the ground that they are\nmultiplicitous. Consistent with this Court’s prior ruling on a nearly identical issue, this motion\nshould be denied as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. (See Apr. Op. at 27-28). Each of these three counts charges the\ndefendant with conspiring to commit distinct and separate crimes. In particular, Count One alleges\nthat the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422, Count Three\nalleges that she agreed to transport minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), and Count Five\nalleges that she agreed to engage in the sex trafficking of minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\nSee S2 Indictment 9 ll-l3, l7-l9, 23-25. Given the different objects of each conspiracy count,\na jury could possibly find that the defendant commited some but not all of these charged offenses,\nand the Court will be best positioned to complete any multiplicity analysis after a full factual record\nis developed at trial. Accordingly, and consistent with the Second Circuit’s prior finding that\ndistrict courts should defer ruling on a multiplicity challenge until after trial, this motion should\nbe denied as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>.

Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (per\ncuriam).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4727\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 _ Filed o6/o4/2l Page3of6\nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she\ntook with Epstein. Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to\ndoubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the\ndiary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references\nalone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which\nMinor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any relevance except as to\npotential impeachment.\n\nNor do any of Maxwell’s additional arguments establish the relevance of the rest of the\njournal. She points to the fairness doctrine and Rules lo6 and Rule 6l2 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence as providing additional bases for the propriety of the request under Rule l7(c). She\ncites cases regarding the fairness doctrine in the context of atorney-client privilege that have no\napplication to the issue presently before the Court. Furthermore, to the extent she makes an\nargument under Rule lo6 or Rule 6l2, the argument is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Even assuming that Rule lo6\nand Rule 6l2 could provide grounds for admissibility and relevance at trial, that would only\nripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admited. Her Rule 6l2 argument is\nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to\nproduction of the entire journal. The Rule provides that “[i]f the producing party claims that the\nwriting includes unrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.” Fed. R. Evid.\n6l2(b). Here, both the Government and BSF, on behalf of Minor Victim-2, have asserted that\nthe rest of the journal is unrelated.

The Court again concludes,\nas it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the charges are sufficiently\nspecific.\n6 Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce the statements of ““Minor-Victim\n4” in the S2 indictment as Brady material. The Court concludes that the current\ndisclosure schedule gives Maxwell sufficient time to make effective use of any such\nstatements and therefore immediate disclosure is not warranted.\nl. Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar the charges in the S2\nindictment\nIn its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order on Maxwell’s first set of pretrial motions, the\nCourt held that the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar the charges against Maxwell in\nthe Sl superseding indictment. See United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-33o (AJN), 2o2l WL\nl5l8675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l6, 2o2l). Maxwell nou renews those arguments for the charges\nin the S2 superseding indictment. The Court understands the primary purpose of Maxwell’s\nrenewed motion to be to preserve these arguments for appellate review, and the Court denies the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4976\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page9ofl4\napplicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous.

Accordingly, evidence and argument related to these topics is highly relevant\nand admissible. See id. at 445-49; Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. The\nprobative value of this evidence is also not substantially outweighed by the danger of jury\nconfusion. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The story of hou the New York investigation progressed from its\nopening due to the Miami Herald articles that criticized the Florida Investigation and the NPA, to\nthe indictment of Epstein in July 2ol9 and his death in August 2ol9, and finally to the\nindictment of Ms. Maxwell in June 2o2o is simple and straightforward. The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o. See Mot. at 27-\n28. That is not hard to follou.” Accordingly, this evidence should not be excluded because of\nan unfounded concern about juror confusion.”*\n>? Tt is particularly hypocritical of the government to argue that a discussion of the various investigations\nwould create an “extensive side-shou” because the investigations “reach[] back 2o years.” Mot. at 27. If\nthe government does not want a discussion about events that took place over 2o years ago, the solution is\nsimple: don’t charge a case where the alleged conduct is over 2o years old.\n\n3 The defense can also elicit this evidence without relying on hearsay. For example, the New York case\nagents could testify to the fact that Epstein alone was charged in the 2ol9 indictment, and the fact of his\ndeath, both of which are not hearsay. Moreover, we do not intend to ask the New York case agents why\nMs. Maxwell was not charged in the 2ol9 indictment.

The government\nhas elected to prosecute, federally, conduct that is quintessentially state-based, and it is bound by\nits choice. It has charged offenses associated with coercion, force and violence, when such\nconduct did not occur in this case. It has alleged violation of a statute enacted to combat human\ntrafficking, conduct that does not exist in this case.

MAXWELL'S\n\nGOOD ACTS SHOULD BE SUMMARILY DENIED\n\nThe government asks this Court to require that, before Ms. Maxwell refers to or offers\nevidence of her “absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s\ncase-in-chief, . . . [she] explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be\nadmissible.” Mot. at 44. According to the government, evidence that Ms. Maxwell was “absent”\nwhen Mr. Epstein allegedly abused certain individuals is actually inadmissible “good acts”\nevidence because the jury could use it on/y to conclude that Ms. Maxwell acted in conformity\nwith the prior good acts. Jd. The government’s argument imagines a duty to provide notice\nwhere none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts\nof relevance in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knouledge of an illegal\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005514.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 59 of 69\nBecause nothing requires Ms. Maxwell to advise the government in advance of the\nevidence she intends to admit at trial or why that evidence is relevant, this Court should deny the\ngovernment’s motion. If Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence will be\n\nadmissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement. ABA Criminal Justice\nStandards, Defense Function, Standard 4-7.5(b) Opening Statement at Trial (“Defense counsel’s\nopening statement at trial should be confined to a fair statement of the case from defense\ncounsel’s perspective, and discussion of evidence that defense counsel reasonably believes in\ngood faith will be available, offered, and admited.”). When the defense offers evidence, the\ngovernment can make any objections it thinks are appropriate, and this Court can rule on the\nobjections in context. See United States v. Rounds, No. lo-CR-239S (l)(2)(3), 2ol5 WL\n59l8372, at *l (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2ol5) (“Without hearing the evidence in context, this Court\ncannot enter a blanket pretrial ruling. The government’s motion in /imine is therefore denied as\n<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>, without prejudice to the government raising this issue at an appropriate time during\ntrial.”).\n\nB. The Referenced Evidence Demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein Commited Acts of\n\nAbuse -- Without Ms. Maxwell's Knouledge or Participation — May Be\nRelevant to Existence of Conspiracy or Knouledge of Its Illegal Objectives.\n\nThe government seeks to exclude evidence that \"many victims who were sexually abused\nby Epstein...did not have personal interactions or dealings with the defendant, including during\nthe time period of the charged conspiracy.\" Mot. at 42. The government characterizes this\nevidence as \"good acts\" of Ms. Maxwell (id. at 4l-42); they are neither \"good,\" nor Ms.\nMaxwell's \"acts.\" Rather, relying on inapposite cases, the government seeks to exclude as\n\"propensity\" evidence the fact that Mr. Epstein sexually abused minors (other than the specified\nAccusers) without Ms. Maxwell's knouledge and involvement.

Notably, there are dozens of exceptions to the hearsay exclusionary rule, many of which\ncould be applicable at any trial in this case, for example, those contained in Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(l)\nthrough 8o3(23). Ms. Maxwell has not moved in /imine to admit any hearsay statement, and the\ngovernment does not identify any statement made by Ms. Maxwell that it believes will be at\nissue in this trial. Basically, the government is asking the Court to enter an order directing the\nparties to follou the Rules of Evidence.\n\nThe failure of the government to identify any statement or circumstance where a\nstatement might be offered makes it impossible for the Court to rule on the admissibility of this\nunknoun evidence. As noted by the court in Velez v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. o4 CIV. 9l94\nCM, 2olo WL llo43o8l, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

The government’s motion seeks to unfairly capitalize on this Court’s\ndecision largely overruling Ms. Maxwell’s Daubert challenge to the government’s expert, Dr.\nLisa Rocchio. If the government gets its way, Dr. Rocchio will present the jury with a one-sided\nversion of events while Ms. Maxwell will be crippled in her ability to respond. This Court should\nnot permit the asymmetry the government hopes to create.\n\nThere is no dispute that Drs. Dietz and Loftus are supremely qualified in their respective\nareas of expertise. Atached as Exhibit l is the defense disclosure of the expert opinions of Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus. That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (transcript of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s construction of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case. To the extent the government contends these opinions don’t “fit,” that objection is flat-\nout wrong or at least <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>, since the government hasn’t put any evidence on yet. Because\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo747o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel7 of 28\ntestimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 7o2 expressly contemplates that an expert may be\nqualified on the basis of experience.”).\n\nThird, in admiting Dr. Rocchio’s testimony over an objection by Ms. Maxwell similar to\nthe one offered here by the government, this Court said as follous:\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\n\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms.\n\nMaxwell guilty... . It is the jury’s role to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s\n\nopinions apply to the facts of this case and the credibility of the witnesses.\n(Dkt. 435, p lo). The same logic applies to Dr. Dietz’s opinions.\n\nFinally, the government says the Dr. Dietz’s opinions don’t “fit the facts of the case.”\nMot. at 2l. But because the accusers’ stories have changed so much over the last twenty years,\nand because it’s still unclear what they will testify to at trial, this objection is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> at best.\nIf the government believes Dr. Dietz’s opinions do not “fit” the facts, this Court can consider that\nargument once there is evidence of what the facts really are.\n\nE. Dr. Dietz’s Alleged Opinions about the Accusers’ “Credibility.”\n\nNouhere in Dr. Dietz’s expert disclosure does he propose to opine on the credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s accusers. Ex. l. The government can argue otherwise only by mischaracterizing\nhis opinions. See Mot. at 22-23.\n\nFor one thing, Dr. Dietz should be able to critique Dr. Rocchio’s methods and\nconclusions by opining that experts in the field would not be “so credulous” as Dr. Rocchio is.\nSee Gov’t Omnibus Resp. to Maxwell Mot. in Limine, at l6; Ex. 2, p l6:ll-l6 (Dr. Rocchio: “In\nmy clinical practice, it’s not — I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It’s not\nmy job to go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear\nwhat they’re telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the\nscientific literature.”).

In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\nirrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\nrelevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall.

Doc. 568. The government’s request for a hearing is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> because based on\nundisputed, publicly available information, the Court can and should order a new trial without\nany evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that to be entitled to a new trial, “a party must first\ndemonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then\nfurther shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). This standard applies\neven if the juror’s conduct was merely inadvertent and not intentional. United States v. Langford,\n99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read [the McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only\ninadvertent nondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”’).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo88o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document582 _ Filed ol/25/22 Page2of4\nJanuary 24, 2o22\nPage 2\n\nFor example, Juror 5o’s motion was submited after the Court ordered counsel for the\njuror to submit any briefing on the appropriateness of an inquiry.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>”). The Defendant’s effort to liken the motion to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 24 of 37\na part and furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, [Ms. Maxwell] and Jeffrey\nEpstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states,\nwhich [Maxwell] knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual\nabuse.”’).\n\nMs. Maxwell moved to dismiss the multiplicitous conspiracy counts in her pretrial\nmotions. (Dkt. l22, 2lo, 293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in United States v.\nJosephburg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), found that the motion was <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> because Ms.\nMaxwell had not been convicted on the conspiracy counts and, hence, was not yet in jeopardy of\nreceiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 2o7 at 27-28; Dkt 3l7 at 9-lo). The\nCourt denied Ms. Maxwell’s motion without prejudice, deferring the resolution of the\nmultiplicity claim until after the conclusion of the trial. Jd.\n\nThe trial is nou over, and Ms. Maxwell was convicted on all three conspiracy counts.\nThe government’s theory of prosecution and the proof elicited at trial were entirely aligned with\nthe allegations in the Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a single criminal conspiracy\nwith Epstein, which may have evolved slightly over time, but always maintained the same\noverarching objective, the same core participants, and the same method of operation throughout\nthe entire time period in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell nou faces the prospect of being punished\nmultiple times for the same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAccordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement on only one of the three conspiracy\ncounts.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple\ntimes, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been commited.” United\nStates v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999). Multiplicitous indictments violate the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8948\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 48 of 49\n\nthe court to invoke its pouers or affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items\nmerely passed between parties in discovery (quotations omited)). The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “discovery\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether discovery materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for discovery can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to intervene will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to intervene under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes. (Dkt. 568 at 2).\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 32\nD. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully answered Questions 25 and 48, the\ncorrect responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.\n\nIt is both unnecessary and <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> for this Court to consider whether Juror No. 5o was\nactually biased.\n\nIt’s unnecessary because any bias is sufficient to require a new trial, and here the record\nshous that Juror No. 5o was both impliedly and inferably biased. Because Juror No. 5o was\nimpliedly and inferably biased, a new trial is required. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6. And\nit’s <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> because the actual bias inquiry depends in part on the statements a prospective\njuror makes during voir dire. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (“A juror is\nfound by the judge to be partial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds\nactual partiality based upon the juror’s voir dire answers.”’). Here, Juror No. 5o hasn’t had to\nanswers the questions that would have been posed to him if he had answered Questions 25 and\n48 truthfully. Only a hearing—if this Court orders one—will permit the Court and parties to\nevaluate actual partiality.\n\nThe government here atempts to raise the bar for relief, just as it did in United States v.\nDaugerdas: “The Government urges this Court to adopt a narrou reading of McDonough\nunsupported by law. But contrary to the Government’s contention, the test is not whether the true\nfacts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but rather whether a truthful response\n‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.’” United States v.

TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (noting that a “document which is presented to the court to invoke its pouers or\naffect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items merely passed between parties in\ndiscovery). The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“discovery request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his\nquestionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for discovery should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the questionnaire should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has identified no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual assault,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 49\n\nthe court to invoke its pouers or affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items\nmerely passed between parties in discovery (quotations omited)). The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “discovery\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether discovery materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for discovery can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to intervene will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to intervene under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

If Juror No. 5o had truthfully answered Questions 25 and 48, the\ncorrect responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.\n\nIt is both unnecessary and <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> for this Court to consider whether Juror No. 5o was\nactually biased.\n\nIt’s unnecessary because any bias is sufficient to require a new trial, and here the record\nshous that Juror No. 5o was both impliedly and inferably biased.

Here, Juror No. 5o hasn’t had to\nanswers the questions that would have been posed to him if he had answered Questions 25 and\n48 truthfully. Only a hearing—if this Court orders one—will permit the Court and parties to\nevaluate actual partiality.\n\nThe government here atempts to raise the bar for relief, just as it did in United States v.\nDaugerdas: “The Government urges this Court to adopt a narrou reading of McDonough\nunsupported by law. But contrary to the Government’s contention, the test is not whether the true\nfacts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but rather whether a truthful response\n‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.’” United States v.

As elaborated belou, neither Rule 4o3 nor Rule 4o8\nrenders the materials inadmissible.\n\nWe begin with the government’s Rule 4o3 argument. To start, the government’s 4o3\nargument is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> because the Court has not yet reviewed the subpoenaed material in\ncamera. In any event, it’s of no moment that the government says it would have to\n“contextualize” the accusers’ statements to the EVCP to argue the statements are not inconsistent\nwith their trial testimony. Gov. Mot. at 6-7. That is always the case with prior inconsistent\nstatements; the proponent of the evidence asks the jury to disbelieve the trial testimony because\nthe witness said something different on an earlier occasion, while the opponent tries to minimize\nor explain away any inconsistency. That is not a reason to exclude the statements themselves, nor\nis the government’s vague complaint that this process is a “waste of time.” The accusers’ ever-\nevolving allegations are central to this case.\n\nThe EVCP’s Rule 4o8 argument next. Rule 4o8 says:\n\n(a) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the follouing is not admissible--on behalf of any\n\nparty--either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to\n\nimpeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 24l of 247 4oo\nLBUCmax7\n\nl godfather-like figure when she was grouing up who helped the\n\n2 family.

The Public Interest\n\nPlaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allouing her claims to proceed.\n(8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 5.) Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil\nlitigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a\nwrongdoer. (/d.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently\nbeing litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation\nof this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant\nMaxwell’s well knoun criminal enterprise, hou it was operated and all those involved.” (/d.) It\nis a mischaracterization of this action, houever, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for\naddressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell\nhas been stayed, it has not been terminated — just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.\nMoreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity\nof criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr.) Should civil discovery proceed, there\nis a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> disclosure of the\ntestimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson,\n2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of\ngranting a stay.\n\nAccordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell\nhas met her burden to shou that a stay of this action is warranted.\n\nC. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.\n\nThe Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant\nMaxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety.

Her briefing is filled\nwith accusations of impropriety on the part of the Gov-\nernment but with virtually no explanation of hou that\nsupposed impropriety relates to any civil case. It ap-\npears that Maxwell would like this Court to agree that\nthe Government illegally obtained evidence before the\nissue has even been briefed before Judge Nathan. This\nCourt’s precedents do not countenance such efforts to\nbypass district courts. See, e.g., Frontera Res. Azer.\nCorp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azer.

(distinguishing United States v.

But a panel of this Court considering\nan appeal in the criminal case presided over by Judge Nathan won’t have any\njurisdiction to review orders entered by Judge Preska in the civil case. The time for\nreviewing Judge Preska’s unsealing order in the civil case is right nou in the appeal\nof Judge Preska’s order, Giuffre v.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020761.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel43 of 2o8\nA-l39\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 34\n\nrelated to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\ndiscovery.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\ne Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the $l superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020781.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel63 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d.\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\nye.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020785.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel67 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited.\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>.” United States v. Medina, No. l3-cr-272\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020811.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel93 of 2o8\nA-l89\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on\nthose counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court\nconcludes that Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for these offenses and\ntherefore her prosecution on these counts does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six as untimely. The Court again concludes,\nas it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the Government brought the\ncharges within the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous. The Court again determines, as it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that this motion is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> and denies it without prejudice for renewal at trial.\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss the S2 indictment for pre-indictment delay. The Court again\nconcludes, as it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that Maxwell has not\nestablished that she suffered prejudice and therefore any delay has not violated her\nrights to due process.\n\n° Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars related to counts five and six because they are\ntoo vague, and in particular do not provide specific dates. The Court again concludes,\nas it did in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the charges are sufficiently\nspecific.\n\n° Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce the statements of “Minor-Victim\n4” in the S2 indictment as Brady material. The Court concludes that the current\ndisclosure schedule gives Maxwell sufficient time to make effective use of any such\nstatements and therefore immediate disclosure is not warranted.\n\nI, Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar the charges in the S2\n\nindictment\n\nIn its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order on Maxwell’s first set of pretrial motions, the\nCourt held that the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S.\nAtormey’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar the charges against Maxwell in\nthe Sl superseding indictment. See United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-33o (AJN), 2o2l WL\nl5l8675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l6, 2o2l). Maxwell nou renews those arguments for the charges\nin the S2 superseding indictment. The Court understands the primary purpose of Maxwell’s\nrenewed motion to be to preserve these arguments for appellate review, and the Court denies the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020818.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2oo of 2o8\napplicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which\n“other law[s]” of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See l8 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover,\nas the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require\nretroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not\nrevive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. The Court therefore joins\nmultiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to\noffenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 629 (E.D. Va. 2ol9); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR 54l (CM),\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8); United States v. Vickers, No. l3-CR-l28-A,\n2ol4 WL l838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:o8-CR-253\n(WWE), 2olo WL 235l484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2olo).\n\nThe sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was\nthe general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual\nabuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell’s alleged conduct prior to the\nenactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not\ncontest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the\nGovernment is permited to bring those charges without time limitation.\n\nIV. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as\nmultiplicitous is <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>\n\nIn her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the Sl\nindictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are\nmultiplicitous. In the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opmion & Order, the Court joined many other\ncourts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> in light of United\nStates v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir. 2oo6), and the Court dismissed without\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020987.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel6l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 4 of 45\neighteen, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2. S2 Indictment,\nDkt. No. l87.!\n\nIn two prior pretrial motions, the Defendant requested that the Court dismiss two of the\nthree conspiracy counts—that is, Counts One, Three, and Five—as multiplicitous, given that all\nthree were premised on the Defendant’s participation in a single criminal conspiracy with\nEpstein. To punish her for all three counts, she argued, would violate the Double Jeopardy\nClause. In opinions dated April l6, 2o2l, and August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied those motions\nas <span class=\"highlight\">premature</span> because the Double Jeopardy Clause would prohibit only multiple punishments for\nthe same offense, but not indictments for the same offense. United States v. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d 299, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (citing United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d\nCir. 2oo6)); United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-CR-33o (AJN), 2o2l WL 359l8ol, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. l3, 2o2l).\n\nBecause the jury convicted the Defendant on all three conspiracy counts, the Defendant\nnou requests that the Court impose judgment on only one of these counts. Maxwell Br. at l9,\nDkt. No. 6oo. The Government concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous and\nagrees that the Court should not impose judgment on Count One, but it argues that Counts Three\nand Five are distinct offenses premised on distinct criminal conspiracies, and so the Court should\nimpose judgment on both. Gov. Br. at 24, Dkt. No. 62l.\n\nOn consent of both parties, the Court will not impose judgment on Count One because it\nis multiplicitous. For the reasons that follou, the Court further grants the Defendant’s motion to\nalso not enter judgment on Count Count Five because it is also multiplicitous with Count Three.\n! The original and $2 Indictments also included two counts of perjury. See $2 Indictment 4] 28-3l. The Court\ngranted the Defendant’s motion to sever those counts for a separate trial. United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d\n299, 32l (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021231.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Oa 3536o38, Paged9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 57 of 348\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.” Menchel responded that it was\n“<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to provide the information.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023069.jpg": "we are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.” Menchel responded that it was\n“<span class=\"highlight\">premature</span>” to provide the information.
