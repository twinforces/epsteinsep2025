STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002084.jpg": "2o-cr- - ocument 97-l9 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of5\nSC\npF\na —\nLe\npo\nee\n\nSTATEMENT OF Rs SECURITY CONSULTANT\n\nl. |, a. served for 25 years in the United Kingdom military.

The\nexhibits should be determined to be self-authenticating.\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 9o2 contains a list of items that are “self-authenticating,” that is “they require no\nextrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admited.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2. Under Rule 9o2(4),\nthat list includes:\nCertified Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official record\n— or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public\noffice as authorized by law — if the copy is certified as correct by:\n(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the\n<span class=\"highlight\">certification</span>; or\n(B) a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a\nfederal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.\nRule 9o2(l), in turn, provides for self-authentication of the follouing:\nDomestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed. A\ndocument that bears:\n(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state,\ndistrict, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of\nthe United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust\nTerritory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of\nany of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of\nany entity named above; and\n(B) asignature purporting to be an execution or atestation.\nFinally, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 27 permits a party to “prove an official record\n... in the same manner as in a civil action.” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), in turn,\npermits proof of a domestic “official record” that is “otherwise admissible and is kept within the\nUnited States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory” through\nDOJ-OGR- oooo74o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\na copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or\n\nby the officer's deputy—and accompanied by a certificate that the\n\nofficer has custody. The certificate must be made under seal:\n\n... (it) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official\n\nduties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept.\nFed. R Civ. P. 44(a)(l); see Fed. R. Evid. 9o2 Advisory Commitee Notes (“Rule 44(a) of the\nRules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided\nauthentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records.”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Minor Victims’ birth certificates are certified and sealed by the appropriate officials,\nand are therefore self-authenticating under Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4). See Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp.,\n45l F.3d 66, 7l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“The original transcript, which includes a <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> by the court\nreporter, is self-authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4).”); United States v. McGee, 439 F. App'x\n837, 839 (llth Cir. 2oll) (“We have held that to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9o2(4), a\n<span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> need only identify the legal custodian's position of authority, and that the copy is true\nand correct.”).\n\nAt the threshold, domestic birth certificates are “public records” within the meaning of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 9o2(4). See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(9) (providing a hearsay exception for\n“Public Records of Vital Statistics,” including “[a] record of a birth . . . if reported to a public\noffice in accordance with a legal duty.”).\n\nPursuant to Rule 9o2(4)(A), a copy of such a record is self-authenticating if “certified as\ncorrect by: . . . the custodian or another person authorized to make the <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span>.” Fed. R. Evid.\n9o2(4)(A). That is the case for each of the birth certificates:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nEach of these certifications is a <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> by a custodian sufficient to satisfy the Rule. See\nRatajack v. Brewster Fire Dept., l78 F. Supp. 3d ll8, l28 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (concluding that\na transcript was self-authenticating based on a court reporter’s <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> that it contained a “true\nrecord”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nThe birth certificates are also self-authenticating under Rule 9o2(4)(B). That rule permits\nself-authentication based on “a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a federal\nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.” This rule is satisfied in two ways.\n\nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 9o2(l). Each <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> bears “a seal\npurporting to be that of... any state .. .; a political subdivision . . . ; or a department, agency, or\nofficer of’ a state. Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(A). And each <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> bears a “signature purporting\nto be an execution or atestation.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(B). The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\nnecessary to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject). That <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> must be “made under seal\n... by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political\nsubdivision where the record is kept.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B)(il).

Nathan\nDecember 8, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\n(D) all these conditions are shoun by the testimony of the custodian or another\n\nqualified witness, or by a <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span> that complies with Rule 9o2(ll) or (l2) or\n\nwith a statute permiting <span class=\"highlight\">certification</span>; and\n\n(E) the opponent does not shou that the source of information or the method or\n\ncircumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\nFed. R. Evid. 8o3(6).\n\nPages 3 to 6 of the government’s leter rehash arguments the government has already\nmade and this Court has already rejected. Ms. Maxwell will not repeat here why these arguments\nfail. (Ms. Maxwell incorporates those arguments by reference.)\n\nWhat’s new is the government’s atempt to rely on Ms. Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition\ntestimony and in particular the questions she was asked and the answers she gave concerning\nDeposition Exhibit l3. The government’s reliance is not persuasive.\n\nFirst, Deposition Exhibit l3 is not the same thing as Exhibit 52. Deposition Exhibit l3 is\na photocopy of some pages of some document. There is no explanation from where the\nphotocopy came, when it was made, who made it, what it purports to be a copy of, whether it is a\ncomplete copy, or whether it is an accurate copy. Whatever it is, it is not a copy of Exhibit 52. (It\nhas, for example, several handwriten pages that aren’t contained in the government’s trial\nexhibit.) Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater. As Mr. Alessi explained in testimony this Court deemed\ninadequate to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit 52 is not the same as the books he saw during his\nemployment with Mr. Epstein. The books in use when he was an employee were two inches\nthick. Exhibit 52 is l/4 inch thick.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8267", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011226.jpg": "(FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK o3/o5/2o2o l2:59 _ PM TREE WO.

On or about August lo, 2ol9, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL\nTHOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as\ncorrectional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n(“MCC”), repeatediy failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners\nunder their watch in the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nInstead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS\nsat at their desk, broused the internet, and moved around the\ncommon area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their ;\nduties, NORL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications\natesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in\n. truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result\nof those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU\nwere being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as\na result of the defendants’ conduct, no correctional officer\nconducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately lo:3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l9o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022070.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 8 of 34\nBoth defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged\nin Counts Two and Three. The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period,\nfrom approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day,\nAugust lo, 2ol9, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As\ncharged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated\ncounts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false\ncertifications atesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the\nSHU were conducted from approximately lo:3o p.m. on August 9 to 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nI. Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government’s Discovery Production\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a discovery deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023471.jpg": "inmate was accounted for.’”® Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and\nthe numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the\ninstitutional count be deemed “cleared” or completed.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or\nsigned a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability\nresponsibilities when, in fact, they had not.’”” These individuals admited to the OIG that instead of\nperforming their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed\nwere in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the\ndocuments knouing that they falsely atested to having completed the counts. Additionally, Noel admited\nto the OIG that she had prefilled the official MCC New York forms documenting the times of the 3o-minute\nrounds, often referred to as round sheets, and falsely atested to having completed the rounds.”®\nNoel and Thomas were indicted by a grand jury for their false certifications of having conducted counts and\nrounds. Subsequently, each entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Atorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York\ndeclined prosecution for the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler.\nThe OIG investigation has found that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel,\nand Thomas knouingly and willingly falsified BOP records in violation of federal law by atesting that they\nhad completed the mandatory rounds and inmate counts on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nAdditionally, as noted above, BOP policy requires employees to cooperate fully with an official investigation\nand truthfully respond to questions. The OIG found that Noel lacked candor when she told the OIG that she\nhad conducted the lo p.m. count when the weight of evidence indicates that, at most, she may have\nconducted a round at the time.\n3. Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 4%) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023769.jpg": "L) PARALEGAL* (See Page 5) LI MITIGATION SPECIALIST (See Page /o)\nOh INTERPRETER MOTHER\nOh PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR (See Page 9)\nAPPLICATION TO ENTER AN INSTITUTION OR CORRESPOND WITH A FEDERAL\nPRISONER AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A LICENSED ATTORNEY.\nThis form has three parts:\nt.

Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 %) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023769.tif": "LO) PARALEGAL* (See Page 5) LI MITIGATION SPECIALIST (See Page /o)\nOh INTERPRETER NOTHER\nOh PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR (See Page 9)\nAPPLICATION TO ENTER AN INSTITUTION OR CORRESPOND WITH A FEDERAL\nPRISONER AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A LICENSED ATTORNEY.\nThis form has three parts:\nt.
