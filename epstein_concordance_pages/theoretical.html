And if confidential materials turn out to be relevant to a court’s ruling,\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that they will be made public\nnotwithstanding any protective order. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. These are not remote or\n<span class=\"highlight\">theoretical</span> possibilities. Each of them predictably came to pass in this case. See Broun, 929\nF.3d at 48 & n.22; Giuffre, 827 F. App’x at l45. It is “unrealistic” to believe that deposition\ntestimony central to a civil case of high public interest will remain effectively sealed indefinitely.\nAndover, 876 F.2d at lo83.\n\nMaxwell claims that she did not expect the Government to be able to obtain her\ndeposition testimony, and that if she knew it would, she never would have testified. If Maxwell\nsubjectively harbored this belief, it was nonetheless unreasonable. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743.\nThe Court further notes that Maxwell was ably represented by a number of atorneys during the\ncivil litigation, who the Court is confident were familiar with the precedents governing protective\norders and public access to judicial documents.\n\nBecause Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents shared with\nthird parties during the civil case, the Government did not engage in a search when it obtained\nthose documents from a third party by subpoena. Maxwell also makes a half-hearted argument\nthat obtaining those documents was a seizure of her personal property.

Issues\nof poor definition, the adoption of the term “grooming” and the prevalence of sexual grooming will be\ndiscussed. Consideration will be given to hou prominent theories of child sexual abuse often neglect\nsexual grooming. This will be folloued by a detailed account of the existing knouledge within the\nliterature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition\nof sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the\nsexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming ls required to facilitate\na preventative approach to child protection.\nKeywords Sexual grooming; theory of child sexual abuse\nIntroduction\nThe complex nature of the tactics used by child sex offenders in their efforts to sexually abuse\nchildren is increasingly evident in the accounts of the people affected by this predatory\nbehaviour. Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand <span class=\"highlight\">theoretical</span> considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo672o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J.

Issues\nof poor definition, the adoption of the term “grooming” and the prevalence of sexual grooming will be\ndiscussed. Consideration will be given to hou prominent theories of child sexual abuse often neglect\nsexual grooming. This will be folloued by a detailed account of the existing knouledge within the\nliterature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition\nof sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the\nsexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming ls required to facilitate\na preventative approach to child protection.\nKeywords Sexual grooming; theory of child sexual abuse\nIntroduction\nThe complex nature of the tactics used by child sex offenders in their efforts to sexually abuse\nchildren is increasingly evident in the accounts of the people affected by this predatory\nbehaviour. Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Gov. Mot. at 7. Not so.\n\nThe government’s argument seems to assume that after an accuser makes her submission\nto the EVCP, there will be no further communications between the EVCP and the accuser. But as\nthe Protocol makes clear, after the initial submission, “[a]dditional documentation may be\nrequested at the discretion of the Administrator” and the Claimant “will be afforded the\nopportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed relevant to the\nAdministrator’s evaluation and determination of the claim.” Protocol, p 5. Moreover, if a\nClaimant submits “an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant,\nexplain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant’s\nLegal Representative (where applicable) to assist in submiting a complete claim.” /d. So,\ncontrary to the government’s argument, there is ample reason to think substantive and potentially\ninconsistent statements were made in “communications” apart from claims submission material\nitself.

Instead, the Protective Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26.

As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the <span class=\"highlight\">theoretical</span> possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool99ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020055.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT D2 Fileebka3A/ Pag Page afL26lo45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every <span class=\"highlight\">theoretical</span> possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020176.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Filecsas2 372l9 ePageHlG5l8\ninstead guided by concerns of efficiency. Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a\ndistrict court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case\ninvolved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any <span class=\"highlight\">theoretical</span> bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality subsequent to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request. As discussed in\nthe opinion from William Julie, French legal counsel (atached as Exhibit A), the\ngovernment’s assertion is entirely incorrect for the follouing reasons:\n\n= The government’s argument goes against the leter of the law.\n= The government’s argument goes against the spirit of the law.\n= The government’s argument is contradicted by precedent and case law.\n(Julie Opinion {ff 6-26).\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033230.jpg": "in 2oo5 recognized Jeffrey’s generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to atend\nthe school who otherwise would not have been able to.\n\nPerhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey’s philanthropy is his no-strings atached\nsupport of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting “bleeding edge” research.\nAs previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in mathematics and science,\nand is particularly atracted to research which focuses on the mathematical foundation of\nlife. By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of <span class=\"highlight\">Theoretical</span> Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of\nMathematics and Biology. Both donations were meant to support my\nbasic research work without any strings atached.\nlo\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323o"};
