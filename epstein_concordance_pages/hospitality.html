This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their <span class=\"highlight\">hospitality</span> and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8 of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 7\n\nCogan, J. & Rocchio, L.
