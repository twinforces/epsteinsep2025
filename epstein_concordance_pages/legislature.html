The state Supreme Court has even concluded\n\nl4 that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides\nl5 the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of\n\nl6 abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and\nl7 its constitution nou require the criminal justice system to\n\nl8 accommodate the rights of crime victims. Further, that the\n\nl9 abatement of criminal convictions has important implications\n2o for these rights.\n2l But coming back to our case, which is what you are\n22 concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude\n23 that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant\n24 as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the\n25 Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo647", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000798.jpg": "Cas@-4Sol4-4648o- RM DbeuMenPsh l Pilee KV lSulsagsdgeiS oF 33 |\nunderage before or during the period in which he abused them.” Id.

Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the <span class=\"highlight\">legislature</span> has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis.
