One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request.

At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2.

The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case.

Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO.

Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is procedurally\nreasonable.\n\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2o22,\njudgment of conviction.\n\nI. BACKGROUND !\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated, and\ncontributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of women and underage\ngirls. Starting in l994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to\nengage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual\ntopics and sexual abuse. Until about 2oo4, this patern of sexual abuse\ncontinued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in\nvarious locations in the United States.\n\nl. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nIn September 2oo7, follouing state and federal investigations\ninto allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered\ninto an NPA with USAO-SDEL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead\nguilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida\n' Unless otherwise noted, the follouing facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial\nand described in the light most favorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678\nF.3d 2o8, 2lo-ll (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“Because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction\nentered after a jury trial, the | ] facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the\nlight most favorable to the Government.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool4855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page4of3l\nfinancial hardship, substance use disorders, and prior sexual abuse. Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households\nwhere sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\n\nC. Post-Trial Motions\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, Maxwell moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 33, based on a juror’s provision of inaccurate information during jury deliberations.\nDkt. 58o. On April l, 2o22, after an evidentiary hearing, Judge Nathan denied that motion.\nDkt. 653.\n\nOn February ll, 2o22, Maxwell made other pretrial motions, under Rules 29 and 33.\nDkt. 6oo. On April 29, 2o22, Judge Nathan denied all but one of these motions. In the motion\nshe granted, Judge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts were multiplicitous, and\ntherefore entered judgment on only one of them. Dkt. 657.\n\nD. Sentencing\n\nSentencing was held on June 28, 2o22. The Government sought a sentence of at least\n36o months’ imprisonment. Dkt. 67o at 53.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021635.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ASO 3536o39, Page2o5 of 2l7\n9o\nM6s2Max2\n\nl Turning to that conduct, the punishment here must\n\n2 reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the\n3 law, provide just punishment for the offense, and deter.\n\n4 First, as to the seriousness, the defendant's conduct\n5 was, as aptly described by the probation department, heinous\n\n6 and predatory.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n43 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\na Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028912.jpg": "| —_——\n!

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span>\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys.

At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6.

Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033225.jpg": "breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\njokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Weill, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> is the strongest lifelong <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span>. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033227.jpg": "in l99l, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of\nher life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span>\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies —\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e., the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday. She wrote of their relationship:\n\nMy experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,\nwith a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and\nvalues and a man of his word.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n33 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\n34 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028912.tif": "| —_—_\n!

Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033225.tif": "breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\nJokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Well, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] aur worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> is the strongest lifelong <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span> one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span>. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033227.tif": "in l99l, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of\nher life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the <span class=\"highlight\">friendship</span>\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies ~\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concems. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e. the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday. She wrote of their relationship:\n\nMy experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,\nwith a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and\nvalues and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always\nfollou through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is\n7\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33227"};
