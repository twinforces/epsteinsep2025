The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous\nto support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a\nwitness believe that their testimony is false. United\nStates v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a\ngeneral mater, “[a] jury is best equipped to determine\nthe meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific\nquestion.” Id. Courts have acknouledged a narrou\nexception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them\ncannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also United\nStates v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if reasonable\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375.

See, e.g., United States\nv. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The\nevidence at trial may shed further light on whether the\nquestions posed were objectively ambiguous in context\nor whether Maxwell subjectively <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> them.\nIn any event, the Court has closely considered each of\nthe categories of questions that Maxwell argues are\nambiguous. None of the alleged ambiguities Maxwell\nidentifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the\ncharges. The context of the questions and answers, in\nconjunction with the Government’s evidence, could\nlead a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements\nwere perjurious. Truth and falsity are questions for the\njury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court\ndeclines to usurp the jury’s role on the limited pretrial\n\nrecord.\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that\n\nMaxwell’s statements were material\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should\nbe dismissed because none of the allegedly false\nstatements were material to the defamation action. In\na civil deposition, a statement is material if it has a\nnatural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful\nanswer might reasonably lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.

Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v.

The Lighte panel reversed a perjury\nconviction, holding that some of the questions giving rise to the allegedly perjurious testimony\nwere “fundamentally ambiguous” and should never have been submited to the jury.” /d. at 375-\n77. “When a line of questioning is so vague as to be ‘fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\nconviction.” /d. at 375 (quoting United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o)).\n\nWhere ambiguity exists on the questioner's part, the test is whether the question, as the\ndeclarant objectively <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> it, is falsely answered. Perjury does not exist by implication.\n\nA jury should not be permited to engage in conjecture of whether any unresponsive\n\nanswer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the\n\nexaminer; the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it bears\n\non whether he does not believe his answer to be true.\nBronston v.

First, Maxwell did\nnot “voluntarily convey” x sucd her, not the other way around.\nMoreover, Maxwell declined to answer 3\nOO ——SSC‘CCes\nRen.

The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not\n\nLimited to the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this\nDistrict and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions\nby the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District\ncontains the follouing language: “It is further <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that this Agreement does not bind any\nfederal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United\nStates, Nos. l4 Civ. 846, o4 Cr. 937-l, 2ol5 WL 34l3596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). No such\nlanguage is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers\nseparately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that\nmake clear that any reference to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a\nwhole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.\n\nl. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.\n\nThe government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District\ncannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,\nthat provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to\nprosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest\nimmunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic\nlimitation.

Justice\nManual, Comment to § 9-27.63o (emphasis added). The absence of the phrase “in this District”\nfrom the co-conspirator immunity provision therefore compels the opposite inference: that the\nparties did not intend to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the SDFL.\n\nMoreover, “a promise to bind other districts can be inferred from the negotiations\nbetween defendant and prosecutor.” Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626. One relevant factor in this analysis\nis the extent to which the USAO negotiating the plea agreement acted on its oun, as opposed to\ninvolving other USAOs or other offices within the Department of Justice.

Id. at 333. In assessing\n\nthat claim, the Johnson court defined the relevant community as White Plains because that was\n“where the trial [was] to be held.” Jd. at 335. The key fact there, houever, was that the\ndefendants’ grand and petit juries were both drawn from White Plains, see id., which made it ,\nonly logical to conclude that the White Plains counties represented the relevant community. See\nid. at 334-35. But the circumstances here are quite different; Schulte’s grand and petit juries\nderive from different courthouses in the District. Accordingly, this factual distinction precludes\n\napplication of Johnson’s conclusion that the relevant community is “the district or division .\n\nwhere the trial is to be held.” See 2l F.

In particular, the NPA expressly covers\nviolations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), and 2423(e), but it does not include the particular\nprovisions charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, which alleges violations of §§ 2422(a) and\n2423(a).

The\ndefendant cites no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.\n\nAccordingly, the NPA immunizes only certain, specific offenses, none of which are\ncontained in the Indictment.

Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l.

Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003023.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 239\n\nNo. l).

As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4).

Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\nmassage, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt.

For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-conviction appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\nindication that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the exception, not the\nrule.” United States v.

But the defendant’s\nprofessed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain\nand obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human\nlife span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex\nwith Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the question when\nshe answered it in July 2ol6, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the\nquestions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she nou assigns to those questions: whether,\nduring the course of her relationship with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself\nhaving sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to shou that she was.\nSee, e.g., Indictment § l (stating that the defendant “assisted, facilitated, and contributed to”\nEpstein’s sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant’s answers were not “literally true\nunder any conceivable interpretation of the questions.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the\ndefendant’s professed confusion nou and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant\nmotion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“A\ndefense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving\nit in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is\nconsidered as a whole.”). Accordingly, a jury should be permited to determine what meaning the\ndefendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false.\nFinally, the defendant answered the follouing questions:\n\nQ. Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at\n\nany of Mr. Epstein's properties?\n\nA.

The issue\nbefore the Court is whether the questions were so fundamentally ambiguous that a jury, after\nhearing the trial evidence, could not conclude that the “response given was false as the defendant\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the question.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited).

Asa threshold issue, houever, materiality is also not appropriate for resolution on a motion\nto dismiss the indictment. As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for discovery in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury conviction, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“It is customary, and ordinarily not\nimproper, to include more than one allegedly false statement in a single count. ... Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\nsufficient to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 239\n\nBecause the defendant has no right to insist that either the grand or petit jury be drawn from\nany particular geographic area within the Southern District, she is wrong to assert that her fair\ncross-section claim must be analyzed against the geographic location in which the offense was\ncommited or the trial is expected to occur. Rather, “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly\ndesignated division, we look to that division to see whether there has been any unlawful or\nunconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added). Here,\nconsistent with the SDNY Grand Jury Plan, the venire for the grand jury that indicted the defendant\nwas drawn from the voter lists of the follouing counties: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan, and Dutchess. That is undoubtedly a “properly designated division” pursuant to the\nJSSA. As noted, the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ ll2(b). For purposes of the JSSA, district courts in such undivided districts have the authority\nto determine “divisions” comprised of “counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions\nsurrounding the places where court is held.” 28 U.S.C. § l869(e). Accordingly, while the SDNY\nJury Plan neither creates nor ever uses the term “White Plains Division” or “Manhatan Division,”\nit contemplates Master Jury Wheels drawn from two geographic areas that satisfy the definition of\n“division” under the JSSA. Thus, in evaluating the defendant’s fair cross-section claim, this Court\nmust “look to that division” —the counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn—\n“to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna,\n68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added).\n\nIn the face of this authority, the defendant cites only two district court cases for the\nproposition that “community” for purposes of a fair cross-section claim is “widely <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to\nmean the district or division where the trial will be held.” (Def.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 348\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto prosecute Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo326l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.!” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.' This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge. The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the\nDepartment’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.\n\nloo The initial draft NPA is atached as Exhibit 2 to this Report.\nLO OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied.\nlo2 Lourie was not present. During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3267", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!\"°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3269", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper.

On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information.

Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded.

Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”>°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding.

VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial.

There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “‘in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Jd. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3695", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3696", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel4of23\nalternative explanation for this difference in terminology, reasonable or otherwise—presumably\nbecause it cannot.\n\nThus, a drafting prosecutor who intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL clearly knew hou to do so, using either of two methods employed elsewhere in the\ndocument. The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDEL, as it did\nelsewhere in the NPA, and provided that “the United States Atorney’s Office . .. will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Again, it did\nnot. It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a reasonable alternative explanation for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision. But to the extent there remains any doubt, plea\nagreements must be construed “strictly against the government,” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89\n(internal citations omited), and the government is held “responsible for imprecisions or\nambiguities in the agreement.” United States v. Padilla, l86 F.3d l36, l42 (2d Cir. l999).\nWhile the government argues that Annabi relieves it of this responsibility where the\n“imprecisions or ambiguities” relate to the geographic applicability of a plea agreement (Opp. 6\nn.2), it cites no authority for this proposition. While Annabi requires an affirmative appearance\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3887", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page 2oflo\nPage 2\n\nFirst, the Court’s recent decision to sever the perjury counts will both shorten the upcoming\ntrial and free up time for the defense to prepare for a trial that includes the new allegations and\ncharges in the S2 Indictment. Although the defense has expressed concerns that trial on the S2\nIndictment would be excessively long, and that the defense would need additional time to prepare\nfor trial, balanced against the two counts added by the S2 Indictment are the two perjury counts\nsevered by the Court’s April l6, 2o2l opinion and order. (Dkt. No. 2o7). In other words, the\ndefense has long maintained that the perjury counts would substantially expand the scope of the\ntrial, but those counts will no longer be at issue during trial in July.\n\nAs the Court may recall, in the defense’s view, the Mann Act and perjury counts involved\nat most “some minimal amount of overlapping evidence,” which was “far outweighed b[y] the\nmuch larger inefficiency of substantially lengthening and complicating the trial.” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat l2). According to the defense, a trial including the perjury counts would have “necessarily\ninvolve[d] litigating a complicated defamation action within a criminal trial,” and possibly require\nresolution of “[a]pproximately 5o substantive motions” and “evidentiary challenges to thousands\nof deposition questions and answers contained in dozens of bankers boxes.” (/d. at 9-lo, l2). The\ndefense also identified more than a dozen areas of evidence that it claimed would be part of the\nperjury trial, including “hou discovery is obtained” in civil litigation, “[t]he testimony of ten to\nfifteen other witnesses including fact and expert witnesses” on materiality, and “[t]he testimony of\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers.” (Dkt No. 224 at 7-8). As a result, in the defense’s view, if the perjury\ncounts were tried together with the Mann Act counts, “this criminal trial will be subsumed by\nevidence not relevant to the main charges, the Mann Act Counts.” (/d. at 8).\n\nThe Government has never <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the perjury counts to require the resolution of\ndozens of motions from the civil case or the trial testimony of dozens of witnesses above and\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3944", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285-2 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 2of/7\nFebruary ll, 2o2l Call with Amanda Kramer\nPresent on Conference Call:\n\ne AUSAs Lara Pomerantz & Maurene Comey\n\ne FBI Special Agent Amanda Young\n\ne Amanda Kramer\n\ne Covington & Burling LLP General Counsel, Steve Anthony\n\nAK’s recollections regarding February 29, 2ol6 Meeting:\n\ne AK confirmed the handwriten notes sent to AK by LP were AK’s oun notes from the\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 meeting.\n\ne In advance of the meeting, AK remembers Pete Skinner reaching out to AK and asking if\nhe could come in to present on a potential case with some other atorneys.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 86 of 349\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto prosecute Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n23 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 89 of 349\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.'°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge. The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the\nDepartment’s interpretation of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.\n\nloo The initial draft NPA is atached as Exhibit 2 to this Report.\nLO OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied.\nlo2 Lourie was not present. During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 92 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°”\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4389", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 94 of 349\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement.

Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !7!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4433", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l9 of 349\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the nghts included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such nghts\nwere afforded.

In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3oo of 349\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial.

As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases.

Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... .

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo69o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 26 of l27 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of relevance. In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons. Trying to sort through those reasons would be\n2o prejudicial pursuant to 4o3 both because they would require\n2l significant time to explore and because juror confusion would\n22 be likely.

And that's what I was trying to capture in the\n\nll instruction, so that that evidence could be relevant, the jury\nl2 could see that evidence as relevant to the enticement to\n\nl3 illegal sexual activity as defined under New York law, which is\nl4 the only way that the government has charged this case, other\nl5 than the trafficking count -- well, including the trafficking\nl6 count, yes.\n\nl7 And that's what I was trying to capture. And I'll\n\nl8 consider the alterations you're suggesting. What we can't do\nl9 is infuse the instruction with the government's case and\n2o arguments. The point here is just to make clear what the\n2l jurors can't do and then, to the extent they otherwise deem the\n22 evidence relevant, they can consider it and we'll give them the\n23 charge at the end of the day.

So at\n9 least the legal accuracy of that has not been established at\nlo this point.\n\nll THE COURT: Will it be an issue in trial?\n\nl2 MR.

That's just a point in\nl6 terms of the accuracy of the proposed jury instruction -- that\nl7 is, whether the sexual conduct was legal or illegal within New\nl8 Mexico.\n\nl9 THE COURT: So what I had said was, \"I anticipate\n2o you'll hear testimony from the next witness about sexual\nal conduct that she says she had with Mr. Epstein in New Mexico.\"\n22 And then I had suggested, because it's what I <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> from\n23 the parties, \"I instruct you that because the witness was over\n24 the age of consent in New Mexico at the relevant time period,\n25 the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l4 of 24 26\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl admissible under the usual rules of relevance.

For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time.

If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l38", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 Filed o2/24/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit.

It is useful\nto note, houever, the follouing facts as they relate to Parse: (l) Parse was the key to the success of\nthe backdated transactions — without his agreement and participation, the J&G atorneys were\npouerless to correct the mistakes; (i) the corrections needed for the Aronoff transactions are\nreflected in David Parse’s oun handwriting on GX 4ol-99 (reflecting the original transaction) and\nGX 4ol-loo (reflecting the revised transaction), shouing that he fully <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the nature of the\nbackdating; (ll) the correction of the transactions required a complex series of steps, including\nreversals of transfers of assets between accounts, reversals of already-completed stock and foreign\ncurrency transactions, and execution of new “as of” foreign currency and stock trades; and (iv) the\nbackdating occurred with not just one client, but several and occurred in two different tax years —\ntax year 2ooo for the Aronoff family members, and tax year 2ool for Michael Toporek, Greg Blair,\nand Mathew Coleman.\n\nIn his sentencing memorandum, Parse atempts to excuse the backdating by claiming, “He\ngave no investment advice, and the trades were executed by his assistant.” (Parse Sent. Mem. at l2).\nThis statement is not only a shameless atempt by Parse to throu his subordinate under the bus, but\nalso a testament as to just hou perverted these tax shelters were that the investment broker, who\notherwise touts his treatment of his long-time clients, (id. at 4 “As a broker, David had 3o to 4o long-\nterm customers, and his goal was to assist them to invest their money wisely.”), nou atempts to\nmake much of the fact that he was not giving investment advice to the backdating clients (or, as the\nevidence shoued, to any of the other tax shelter clients). As to Parse’s suggestion that the\nbackdating transactions were done not by Parse, but by Carrie Yackee, his sales assistant (Parse\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9532", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009533.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas 6o82.

Given the foregoing, Parse’s\natempt to blame her for his criminal conduct is inconsistent with the facts; it is also, in a larger\n\nsense, inexcusable.\n\nTo the extent that Parse trial and current counsel have suggested and continue to suggest that\nthe backdating transactions were approved by Deutsche Bank, the only approvals were from Parse\nhimself, and on some of the trade tickets, the signature of the branch manager appears.’ Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that the branch manager knew of the purpose and animus for the backdated\ntransactions. To the extent that a branch manager actually knew what was occurring, that fact would\nonly render the branch manager a co-conspirator, and not excuse Parse’s criminal conduct.\n\nHouever complex the tax shelters, the fraudulent backdating was nothing more than garden-\nvariety fraud commited to achieve impermissible tax results.

Maxwell Br. at 5o. But this reading of Rule 6o6\nhas been squarely rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that the “plain meaning” of this\nlanguage is that “Rule 6o6(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party\nseeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” Warger v.

It is the\nsame rule of evidence in issue, and the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court apply here\nwith equal force.\n\nThe Defendant may also be suggesting in this argument that Rule 6o6 does not bar Juror\n5o’s statements because they concern “extraneous prejudicial information,” which is an\nenumerated exception to the rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up).

The same is true here, as the second juror’s alleged undisclosed experience “did not\nprovide either [the juror] or the rest of the jury with any specific knouledge regarding” this\nparticular case. /d. at 5l-52.

And the fact that the defense failed to\nseek or receive a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony did not provide a separate basis for\nincluding a limiting instruction in the final charge.

The Court, the Government, and\nthe defense were painstaking during trial to ensure that the jury <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the Mann Act\ncounts required an intent to commit a criminal sexual act in New York.

The Court Should Enter Judgment on Counts Three and Five\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged three conspiracies under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Counts One and\nThree were predicated on two different provisions of the Mann Act, whereas Count Five charged\na conspiracy based on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. As the Court held in an April l6,\n2o2l Order, the Government was entitled to present these three different counts to the jury. (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 27). Follouing the verdict, houever, the Government agrees that the Court should enter\njudgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the similarities between those\ncounts. Accordingly, of the three conspiracy counts charged in the S2 Indictment, the Government\nsubmits that the Court should enter judgment on Count Three, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2423(a), and Count Five, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nCounts Three and Five are not multiplicitous, and the Court should enter judgment on both\ncounts. In particular, as discussed in greater detail belou, Counts Three and Five arose from\ndifferent criminal schemes, involving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates,\nand a different modus operandi.

And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit.

For example, potential jurors said they were groped or harassed on the\nsubway, harassed at work, or touched inappropriately in a social seting.

It is useful\nto note, houever, the follouing facts as they relate to Parse: (l) Parse was the key to the success of\nthe backdated transactions — without his agreement and participation, the J&G atorneys were\npouerless to correct the mistakes; (i) the corrections needed for the Aronoff transactions are\nreflected in David Parse’s oun handwriting on GX 4ol-99 (reflecting the original transaction) and\nGX 4ol-loo (reflecting the revised transaction), shouing that he fully <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the nature of the\nbackdating; (ll) the correction of the transactions required a complex series of steps, including\nreversals of transfers of assets between accounts, reversals of already-completed stock and foreign\ncurrency transactions, and execution of new “as of” foreign currency and stock trades; and (iv) the\nbackdating occurred with not just one client, but several and occurred in two different tax years —\ntax year 2ooo for the Aronoff family members, and tax year 2ool for Michael Toporek, Greg Blair,\nand Mathew Coleman.\n\nIn his sentencing memorandum, Parse atempts to excuse the backdating by claiming, “He\ngave no investment advice, and the trades were executed by his assistant.” (Parse Sent. Mem. at l2).\nThis statement is not only a shameless atempt by Parse to throu his subordinate under the bus, but\nalso a testament as to just hou perverted these tax shelters were that the investment broker, who\notherwise touts his treatment of his long-time clients, (id. at 4 “As a broker, David had 3o to 4o long-\nterm customers, and his goal was to assist them to invest their money wisely.”), nou atempts to\nmake much of the fact that he was not giving investment advice to the backdating clients (or, as the\nevidence shoued, to any of the other tax shelter clients). As to Parse’s suggestion that the\nbackdating transactions were done not by Parse, but by Carrie Yackee, his sales assistant (Parse\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010212.jpg": "ce mer a; ane el\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 9 of 4l\nSentencing Mem, at l2), the evidence shoued and Yackee testified persistently, consistently, and\ncredibly that she acted at all times at the instruction of David Parse. Given the foregoing, Parse’s\natempt to blame her for his criminal conduct is inconsistent with the facts; it is also, in a larger\nsense, inexcusable.\n\nTo the extent that Parse trial and current counsel have suggested and continue to suggest that\nthe backdating transactions were approved by Deutsche Bank, the only approvals were from Parse\nhimself, and on some of the trade tickets, the signature of the branch manager appears.’ Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that the branch manager knew of the purpose and animus for the backdated\ntransactions. To the extent that a branch manager actually knew what was occurring, that fact would\nonly render the branch manager a co-conspirator, and not excuse Parse’s criminal conduct.\n\nHouever complex the tax shelters, the fraudulent backdating was nothing more than garden-\nvariety fraud commited to achieve impermissible tax results.

He explained that he was unconcerned with diligently completing the\nquestionnaire; he assumed due to the sheer “volume” of prospective jurors being screened that it\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo345", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

(/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s respective bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the massage oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). Alessi explained during his trial testimony that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel3oof55\n\nand girls) that were academically gifted to discuss college plans and international trips.

Annie did not want to go to New Mexico after Epstein had caressed and held Annie’s hand\nand rubbed her foot and leg while watching a movie at a theater in New York in December l995.\n(PSR ¥ 48). Despite those misgivings, Annie felt more comfortable going to New Mexico once\nshe <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the defendant, a groun woman in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would\nbe there with Annie. (PSR § 49). Yet, when Annie found herself alone at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico with just Epstein and the defendant, she found that the defendant was anything but a\nprotector. (PSR § 5o). Instead, Annie found that the purpose of the trip was to groom her for\nsexual abuse.\n\nDuring the New Mexico trip, the defendant took steps to normalize sexual contact under\nthe ruse of massage. The defendant asked Annie if she had ever had a professional massage, and\nsaid that she wanted Annie to have that experience and that she would be happy to give Annie a\nmassage. (PSR 452). After telling Annie to get undressed, the defendant gave Annie a massage\non a massage table while Annie was naked. (/d.). During the massage, the defendant rubbed\nAnnie’s body and directed Annie to roll over so that Annie was laying on her back. (/d.). After\nAnnie complied and rolled to her back, the defendant pulled the sheet doun and exposed Annie’s\nbreasts. (/d.). Then, while Annie was naked and isolated on a ranch in the middle of nouhere, the\ndefendant rubbed Annie’s breasts. (/d.). Annie testified that she wanted “badly to get off of the\ntable and have this massage be done.” (/d.). The defendant sexually abused a teenage girl in an\neffort to groom her for further abuse.\n\nFollouing through on that plan on this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later got into\nAnnie’s bed, cuddled with her, pressed his body into her, and rubbed against her.

Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants.

(Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833).

To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata.

The November 26 leter identifies the\nprecise exhibits about which Flatley will testify, including the exhibits that display metadata fields\n(which were produced on October ll, 2o2l), and it provides detail about the methods and metadata\nabout which he will testify. The sufficiency of the Government’s notice is evidenced by the fact\nthat the defendant noticed a rebutal expert on November l, 2o2l, and they likewise have had\nample time to prepare any cross-examination on metadata.

And on page\nl9 73, I had asked a question about whether there was anything\n2o about what you're testifying about here that says that grooming\n2l can only be done for the benefit of the person doing the\n22 grooming, to which Dr. Rocchio responded, No, there's not. And\n23 then your Honor had asked a series of questions relating to the\n24 presence of a third party, what the defense has been referring\n25 to as grooming by proxy, which is a different subject mater.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2352", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 69 of 228 745\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl happens for the gratification of a third person.\n\n2 And I said, Is there anything like that in the child\ni) sexual abuse context beyond the, sort of, institutional\n\n4 authority positions that you've discussed?\n\niy And she said no, which was the basis for my exclusion\n6 of that small windou of her testimony.\n\n7 So I still think that even if there are slightly\n\n8 distinct points to be made as to whether grooming always\n\n9 happens for the sexual gratification of the person who's doing\nlo the grooming, and whether grooming by a third person\n\nll facilitates child sexual abuse for another person, for me, the\nl2 context in the Daubert overlapped and related to the same\n\nl3 issue, which is the narrou issue that I excluded on.\n\nl4 So I take your point that there's a slight analytical\nl5 distinction and, therefore, I don't believe you intentionally\nl6 violated my ruling.

These are the three who you originally\n22 had evidence from against Ms. Maxwell. Carolyn came to you\n23 later. You spoke to her first in 2ol9; she wanted to talk to\n24 you with a lawyer.

Trauma is a continuum, so that is one of the definitions of\n7 \"trauma,\" but other things have been found to be traumatic in\n\n8 individuals’ experiences that do not necessarily rise to the\n\n9 level of criterion A in PTSD. For example, there's a whole\n\nlo \"nother section in the DSM called \"Other Stressor and Trauma\n\nll Disorders\" that could refer to other traumatic events that\n\nl2 don't fit that specific definition, but childhood sexual abuse\nl3 is commonly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to fall under the definition of \"sexual\nl4 violence.\" So to that degree, yes.\n\nl5 Q.

These are the three who you originally\n22 had evidence from against Ms. Maxwell. Carolyn came to you\n23 later. You spoke to her first in 2ol9; she wanted to talk to\n24 you with a lawyer.

I would have\n2o less of a problem excusing the juror if the juror was in the\n2l alternate pool as opposed to the main pool.

And on page\nl9 73, I had asked a question about whether there was anything\n2o about what you're testifying about here that says that grooming\n2l can only be done for the benefit of the person doing the\n22 grooming, to which Dr. Rocchio responded, No, there's not. And\n23 then your Honor had asked a series of questions relating to the\n24 presence of a third party, what the defense has been referring\n25 to as grooming by proxy, which is a different subject mater.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool794o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 69 of 228 745\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl happens for the gratification of a third person.\n\n2 And I said, Is there anything like that in the child\ni) sexual abuse context beyond the, sort of, institutional\n\n4 authority positions that you've discussed?\n\niy And she said no, which was the basis for my exclusion\n6 of that small windou of her testimony.\n\n7 So I still think that even if there are slightly\n\n8 distinct points to be made as to whether grooming always\n\n9 happens for the sexual gratification of the person who's doing\nlo the grooming, and whether grooming by a third person\n\nll facilitates child sexual abuse for another person, for me, the\nl2 context in the Daubert overlapped and related to the same\n\nl3 issue, which is the narrou issue that I excluded on.\n\nl4 So I take your point that there's a slight analytical\nl5 distinction and, therefore, I don't believe you intentionally\nl6 violated my ruling.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. ‘The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. /d. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020781.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel63 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d.\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\nye.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020848.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page22 of 22l\n3l4l\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl So I'll take any requests beyond simply saying, I\n\n2 received your note.

And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24.

He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive.

Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021251.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page/9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE, Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n88 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021259.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N85 3536o38, Page87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 348\nto OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out. Because .. . if the leter didn’t go\nout we can make this all go away and restart.” Menchel confirmed to her that he had sent the leter\nout by email.\n\nLater that day, the West Palm Beach FBI squad supervisor told Sloman that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nEpstein had rejected the USAO’s proposal, and he asked when Epstein would be charged.\nVillafafia told OPR that the squad supervisor “yelled at” Sloman about the USAO’s decision not\nto prosecute Epstein federally. Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] . . . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”??\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl, Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.°* On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n% In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na4 Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n95 Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021262.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O88 3536o38, Page9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. ©’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about... a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . .. that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l265", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021267.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E93 3536o38, Page95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.'!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “‘a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l267", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span.

Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal... . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief’ Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Tust seemed unserious.”\n\nTi Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different.

As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . .

This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021392.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22o of 258\nSA-2l8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded.

Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°%\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. Ina leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.° The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial... . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n2o8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021475.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER _399 3536o39, Page45 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing.

Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding.

During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.**° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial.

See Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(2)(A). To the extent that argument is\nraised, it is meritless. Information is “extraneous” when it is “external to the jury”—that is,\n“publicity and information related specifically to the case the jurors are meant to decide,” rather\nthan “the general body of experiences that jurors are <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to bring with them to the jury\nroom.” Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (cleaned up).

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023057.jpg": "Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o57", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023059.jpg": "On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.** On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n72 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nao After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023063.jpg": "of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023076.jpg": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”°’ Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.® Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “‘a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.*4 Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\nal In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nBe Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried .. . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n8 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023089.jpg": "<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023097.jpg": "to OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] .. . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n2 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023100.jpg": "Villafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3.

This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcem about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°”\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about . .. a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023105.jpg": "having directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges.

Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status.

Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims.

Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\n<span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“nolitically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023200.jpg": "promise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l/8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023206.jpg": "Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]. . . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 7”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023210.jpg": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal responsibility” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\na Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.jpg": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023224.jpg": "parties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . ..\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else.

This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor.

In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n3o3 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nl28 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\ned Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023311.jpg": "resolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding.

During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.“° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023401.jpg": "medical record note reflected that, on this same date, Epstein was provided with his personally-ouned\nmedical device. BOP witnesses told the OIG that on that same date, Epstein and Inmate 3 were moved to\ncell Zo6-22o in the L Tier of the SHU to accommodate the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device. Of all\nthe cells in the SHU, cell Zo6-22o was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in\nthe common area of the SHU, which was approximately l5 feet away.\nInmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell ZO6-22o in the L Tier,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who\nwould not bother Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the\nbotom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new\ncellmate slept on the floor. Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span> that\nsleeping on the floor was not alloued and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.\nWhen Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said\nhe knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch. According to Inmate 3,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3\nshould keep an eye on him. Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to\nserve as a suicide prevention advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.\nInmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment.\nAccording to Inmate 3, COs brought two matresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.\nEpstein put the matresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door\nwindou when the cell door is closed. Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate\n3 said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets.\nInmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate\nbecause Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. Epstein told Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not\ngoing to cause Inmate 3 any trouble.\nthat inmates were physically located in the cells to which they were assigned in SENTRY. Associate Warden l told the\nOIG that the error would have been identified if SHU staff members had conducted a bed-book count, but there was no\nrequirement to do a bed-book count every certain number of days. Associate Warden l explained that during a bed-\nbook count, the staff members have a roster with them while conducting the count of inmates assigned to their housing\nunit to ensure all inmates are accounted for and in their assigned cells. The OIG’s investigation revealed that these and\nother cell assignment and recordkeeping errors would have been uncovered had MCC New York SHU staff been\nundertaking inmate accountability measures, such as rounds, counts, census checks, and bed-book checks.\n\n34\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023440.jpg": "then returned to the SHU and worked there for approximately l hour, along with the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant and Noel. The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and\nuntil approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said\nhe delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same\non another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food\nto the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU\nOfficers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he <span class=\"highlight\">understood</span>\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs shou, among other things, Epstein on his back with an\nintravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him\nwearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York shou Epstein in\na hospital goun, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital which shou Epstein in a hospital goun.\nAdditionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at\nthe time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of\nsight to Epstein’s cell.44 One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from\nEpstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side\nof L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, a litle before l2 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.\nInmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning\nof August lo prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August lo. Inmate 5 said the male\nCO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see\nEpstein’s legs from the knee doun but could tell that Epstein was laying doun on his back because his feet\nwere pointed upward. The male CO bent doun to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The\nmale CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said\nboth the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said\nthat once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest\ncompressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the\nfemale CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the buton.

In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European.

So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031420.jpg": "Ne\nDate: 9/ol/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: lo\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n\nl-o3-ool498 (Continued)\nat which time she did not talk to him per instructions by her\ndivorce atorney.

This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—vwithout his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary-admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe school with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl lefi school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came m,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhtn-/Awww nrinthis clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acton=cnt &title=The+Fantasist&exnire=acurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 24 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032313.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 28\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nUpon Robson s entry in the unmarked Detective vehicle, I placed a tape\nrecorder within the vehicle to record any conversations within the\nvehicle.

I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school.

Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends.

He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies —\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back.
