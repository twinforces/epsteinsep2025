Authenticity\n\nAs a general mater, “an item of evidence must ‘be authenticated through introduction of\nevidence sufficient to warrant a finding that the item is what the proponent says it is.”” United\nStates v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (quoting Crawford v. Tribeca\nLending Corp., 8l5 F.3d l2l, l26 (2d Cir. 2ol6)). “Under Rule 9ol of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence, ‘[t]he requirement of authentication . . . as a condition precedent to admissibility is\nsatisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the mater in question is what its proponent\nclaims.’” United States v. Jackson, 345 F.3d 59, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a)).\n\nThis bar for authentication “is ‘not particularly high.’” United States v. Bout, 65l F. App’x\n62, 63-64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 457 Filed ll/l3/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\n\nconspiracy. By its very nature, a contact book that collects phone numbers for many people is not\nthe sort of thing that is generated in a single day. Like the digital contact list in the ordinary modern\ncellphone, a <span class=\"highlight\">directory</span> represents a collection of information and numbers typically gathered over\na period of years. Based on this alone, the jury could readily infer that Government Exhibit 52,\nwhich was seen by Employee-l in a. contains information the defendant collected during the\nperiod of the conspiracy, including 2oo4 and earlier. But there is more. As noted, the book\ncontains contact information for es\nee\nee\nee\n\nIn any event, GX-52 is relevant even if it was created after the period of the conspiracy—\nthough, as noted, it clearly was not. Proof that the defendant, at any point in time, had contact\ninformation for is relevant to her knouledge of and participation\nin the crime. Take, for example, a defendant charged with a patern of bank robberies. If police\nofficers searched the defendant’s apartment long after the crimes were commited and discovered\na list of the various bank branches the defendant had robbed, there would be no question that the\nlist was relevant, even if it were unclear when the list was made or there was some suggestion that\nthe list was made a year after the robberies. Such a list would reflect the defendant’s knouledge\nof relevant locations, persons, and activities involved in the alleged criminal conduct. This case\nis no different. No mater when the defendant had this contact information, this evidence\ndemonstrates that the defendant knew LC\nPo Thus, this evidence is directly relevant to the issues before the\nJury at this trial. See United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d lo2, l32 (2d Cir. 2olo) (“To be\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 49l Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nidentification.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nThe defendant’s argument suggests that Government Exhibit 52 is unique in a way\nunsupported by the evidence. Government Exhibit 52 is a bound, sewn, typed address book with\na particular cover. Employee-l will testify that, based on its appearance, contents, and distinctive\ncharacteristics, it appears to be a copy of the defendant’s address book. She will also testify that\nother bound, sewn, typed copies of the same address book with the same cover were located in\nspecific places in Epstein’s Palm Beach house, as was the operating practice of Epstein’s house.\nThat testimony is corroborated by Government Exhibit 6o6, the household manual, which states\nthat “A copy of Mr Epstein and Ms Maxwell’s telephone directories must be placed to the right of\neach telephone (except for the Guestrooms).” (GX 6o6 at 7). And it is corroborated by Mr.\nRodriguez himself, whose counsel said at sentencing in his case that the book he possessed was “a\ncopy of the book, of which there were many copies, and Mr. Rodriguez had one as Mr. Epstein’s\nhouse man.” Sent.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid sufficient foundation for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan Alessi, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the household manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, Alessi personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and recognized it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, Alessi testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he recognized from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically recognized entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G. (/d.)\n\nAlthough Alessi only worked in the Palm Beach house until the end of 2oo2, he explained\nthat the practice during his twelve years that he worked for Epstein was to print new directories\ntwice a year. Tr. at 864. He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853. That is confirmed by the date inside the book (2oo4-2oo5) and the fact that it contains\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document533 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nthe name of Sarah Kellen, who began working for Epstein shortly before Alessi left his\nemployment. Tr. at 832; see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (permiting authentication based on the\n“contents” of the item). Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52. (See id. at 872-73, 875 “The botom line\nhere, Mr. Alessi, you don’t have any personal knouledge about first hou or when Exhibit 52 was\ncreated; correct?”).! But authentication does not require evidence about the circumstances of the\ncreation or seizure of a piece of evidence, so long as it can be identified by its distinctive markings\nas what the proponent claims it is. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25. It is well setled that\ndefects in chain of custody go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSecond, the household manual—dating from 2oo5, the year on Government Exhibit 52—\ndemonstrates that the practice identified by Alessi remained in operation into 2oo5. The manual\nexplains that “[t]elephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone\ndirectories are available.” GX 6o6 at 7. And it explained that the directories in fact belong to the\ndefendant and Epstein: a copy of their directories “must be placed to the right of each telephone\n(except for the Guestrooms).” GX 6o6 at 7.\n\nThird, the contents of Government Exhibit 52 have been confirmed by other evidence to\naccurately reflect relationships between the defendant and other individuals. See United States v.\nPrevezon Holdings, Ltd., 3l9 F.R.D. 459, 463 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (permiting authentication under\n' Defense counsel also pointed to the additional markings that may have been added by Rodriguez\nor the FBI.

This “minimal” standard can be satisfied by\nthe “testimony of a witness with knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be.” United\nStates v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7). Once this “minimal” standard is met, “the\nother party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its\nimportance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other\nchallenges go to the weight of the evidence—not to its admissibility.” United States v.

R. Evid. 8ol(c)(2).\n\nIl. ANALYSIS\n\nThe Court first addresses authentication under Rule 9ol and concludes that Mr. Alessi’s\ntestimony is sufficient to meet this Rule’s standard. Mr. Alessi testified that he worked in the\nPalm Beach residence from l99o to December 2oo2. Trial Tr. at 778. His job required him to\nspend a significant amount of time in the residence. /d. at 779-8o. Based on his years working\nat the residence, he recalled that Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell maintained telephone directories\nand that GX 52 was a version of those directories.\n\nHe first testified about the function of the telephone directories in the Palm Beach\nresidence, and that he recalled first seeing the directories in l995 or l996. Id. at 849. He\ntestified where in the home the directories were kept—“in the kitchen desk,” “Ms. Maxwell’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page3of8\ndesk,” “Mr. Epstein’s three desks he had in the house,” “Ms. Maxwell’s each side of her night\ntable or Mr. Epstein’s night table.” Jd. He testified that the directories were updated either once\nor twice a year, and new contacts were added in each new copy. /d. Mr. Alessi’s testimony on\nthis score is corroborated by Government Exhibit 6o6, the “Household Manual.” See id. 827-28\n(Mr. Alessi identifying the manual’s reference to “JE and GM telephone directories” as “books\nwith hundreds and hundreds of names and their telephone numbers” (referring to GX 6o6 at lo));\nsee also GX 6o6 at 7 (“A copy of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell’s telephone directories must be\nplaced to the right of each telephone (except for the Guestrooms).”).\n\nHe also explained the physical appearance of the directories he observed while working\nfor Mr. Epstein. He explained hou the books had a “type of hard binding,” were either “blue or\nblack,” and the “size of a large telephone.” Trial Tr. at 827-28. And as to the contents, he\ntestified that the directories he observed contained: “a list of alphabetical order of all the people,\nfriends and families and business with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,” id. at 828; Jane’s contact\ninformation in particular, id. at 848-49; and “a page with the massages—massage therapists for\nPalm Beach,” id.\n\nUpon examining GX 52, he testified that “the type of book, it was the same” as the\ndirectories he had just recalled observing during at least six of his over ten years of employment\nwith Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein. /d. at 85o. As for the appearance, he testified that GX 52\nhad “exactly the same cover of the directories that I saw,” “the same binding,” and “exactly” the\n“layout” as the books he recalled. /d. at 85l. While he did note that GX 52 was thinner and had\n“much smaller font” than the books he recalled, he overall testified that the “format was the\nsame.” /d. at 852. And as for the contents, he testified that he had reviewed every page of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nexhibit and that he recognized “many, many, many, many names” amongst the entries, including\nsome of the entries that were for “massage in Palm Beach.” /d. at 85l.\n\nThe Defense first objects that Mr. Alessi has no personal knouledge about the creation of\nthis particular <span class=\"highlight\">directory</span> and is thus incapable of authenticating the exhibit. Mr. Alessi\nacknouledged that GX 52 was a different version than the directories he was familiar with\nbecause GX 52 was not as thick as those versions, and his name and his wife’s name were in the\nversion he observed, but neither his name nor his wife’s name was in GX 52. Id. at 853, 865.\nBut a document may be admited under 9ol(b)(4) even when no witness saw the creation of the\ndocument or the particular copy admited at trial.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o), the court\naffirmed the district court’s authentication of handwriten leters even though no testifying\nwitness confirmed they had previously examined the leters. Instead, testimony that the\n“appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics” of the\nleters were consistent with other leters previously observed was sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.\nId. at 24-25. Similarly, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of copies of\ncredit card receipts despite uncertainty about who signed the receipts and when. 37l F.3d at 38;\nsee also United States v. Gordon, 634 F.2d 639, 643-44 (lst Cir. l98o) (referring to\nauthenticated documents as “parallel documents” with distinctive characteristics such as being\nprinted on the “same stationary,” to “indicate a common authorship”). Finally, cases have\nalloued a witness to authenticate emails under Rule 9ol(b)(4), even if they were not a recipient\nof the specific email being admited, when the witness had a history and familiarity with the\ndefendant’s email communication tendencies. See, e.g., United States v. Bertram, 259 F. Supp.\n3d 638 (E.D. Ky. 2ol7); see also United States v. Gasperini, l6-CR-44l (NGG), 2ol7 WL\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\n3l4o366, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“The Court is unaware of any authority that authentication of\nemails can only come through a witness with direct knouledge of the drafting, and Defendant\nprovides none.”).\n\nConcluding that Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently authenticates GX 52 follous this\nwell-tread path. Mr. Alessi’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. Alessi was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v. Stuckey, No. o6 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2oo7 WL 2962594, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (citing United States v. Morrison, l53 F.3d 34, 57 (2d Cir. l998)). Thus,\narguments as to the Government’s possession of the document or hou it has been maintained do\nnot go to authentication. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 25 (“Although the Government did not\npresent evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, ... . any\n> The Court notes that this conclusion does not rely on the Government’s citation in its December 8, 2o2l, leter to\nthe transcript of Ms. Maxwell’s April 2ol6 civil deposition.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page6of8\nremaining questions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary weight, not their\nadmissibility.”). Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently surmounts Rule 9ol’s “minimal” bar. The\nDefense’s objection on authentication grounds is accordingly overruled.\n\nThe Court also overrules the Defense’s objection on hearsay grounds. The <span class=\"highlight\">directory</span> does\nnot constitute hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth that the names listed identify a\nparticular individual or that the phone numbers listed next to the names are correct. The Second\nCircuit has affirmed the admission of documents that provide names and contact information for\nthe non-hearsay purpose of linking the individual that possessed that document to that name or\nphone number, rather than for the truth of that contact information. For example, in United\nStates v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39 (2d Cir. 2oo8), the defense objected on hearsay grounds to\nthe admission of two address books that belonged to mujahidin fighters that listed the\ndefendant’s name and a phone number. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that the address\nbooks were not hearsay because they were not admited to establish that the phone number next\nto defendant’s name “was, in fact, his phone number.” /d. at l76. Rather, it was relevant alone\nthat his “name and contact information appeared in the address books of two men identified as\nmujahidin fighters.” Jd.\n\nIn an analogous line of cases, the Second Circuit has regularly admited for non-hearsay\npurposes documents that contain a name for the fact that a person claiming to have that name\ntook a particular action. For example, in United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 373 (2d\nCir. 2oo6), the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of Western Union wire receipts to prove\nthat a person that claimed to have the defendant’s name completed wire orders. The Government\nalso admited other circumstantial evidence to permit the jury to infer that the receipts were\n“linked to” the defendant. /d. at 374; see also United States v. Zapata, 356 F. Supp. 2d 323,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page7of8\n33o-3l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). Similarly, in United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. l98o),\nthe Second Circuit affirmed admission of a hotel guest card for the non-hearsay purpose that a\nperson claiming to have the name of a coconspirator registered at the hotel. The Government\nthen admited “other evidence . . . from which the jury could infer that the hotel card spoke the\ntruth.” Jd. at lol. Last, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit concluded that credit card receipts\nwere admissible because they “tended to shou that a person referring to himself as [the\ndefendant] signed receipts on the dates and times in question.” 37l F.3d at 39. Other courts\nhave taken a similar approach to the Second Circuit. See e.g., United States v. Chavez, 229 F.3d\n946, 953-54 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (scrap of paper containing a phone number admissible “for the non-\nhearsay purpose of linking the co-conspirators,” but “the number could not have been submited\nfor the truth of the mater asserted”); United States v. Munguia, 273 F. App’x 5l7, 52l (6th Cir.\n2oo8) (affirming admission of “cell-phone contact lists . . . for the non-hearsay purpose of\nlinking [the defendant] to his co-conspirators”); United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, l48 F.3d 577,\n59l (6th Cir. l998) (“The government offered the numbers and addresses to demonstrate, in\nconjunction with other evidence, that members of the conspiracy associated with each other for\nbusiness purposes. . . . These documents are not offered to prove the information they contained\nand therefore, may not be excluded as hearsay.”).\n\nHere, the jury could conclude based on the testimony of Mr. Alessi and GX 6o6 that Ms.\nMaxwell regularly used this telephone <span class=\"highlight\">directory</span>, versions of which were maintained over the\nyears at the Palm Beach residence. See Trial Tr. at 849; GX 6o6 at 7, lo. The <span class=\"highlight\">directory</span> is thus\nrelevant for the non-hearsay purpose that it tends to shou a link between Ms. Maxwell and the\nnames and phone numbers listed, as well as hou the information was organized.
