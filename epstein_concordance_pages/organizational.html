Supp. 3d at 724 (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting United States v. Smith,\n985 F. Supp. 2d 547, 6lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4)).\n\nIn seting forth allegations in an indictment, the Government is not limited to description\nof only the bare elements of a crime; rather, an indictment may be used to provide background to\nthe charged criminal conduct, to describe the circumstances, means, and methods of an offense,\nand to describe evidence that is otherwise admissible at trial. Simply put, “[s]tatements providing\nbackground are relevant and need not be struck.” United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45l,\n466 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citing Mulder, 273 F.3d at loo). Allegations also will not be stricken where\nthey elucidate the circumstances, means, and methods of a charged scheme or would be admissible,\nin the alternative, under Rule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
