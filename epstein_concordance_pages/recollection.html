That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo323o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 57 of 348\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.’ Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had jomed Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand. After that concern was brought to my atention several\nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of\ncommand. ... If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\n\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims. If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to\ngive hope to more girls.\n\nAs far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone\nconclusion, I don’t knou of any case in the Office where an\ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict. And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently. I worked with\nthe agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment\npackage that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of\ncrimes have been commited. More importantly, I believe there is\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated.\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2o of 348\n\nD. Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of this call, and Lourie also could\nl? The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2oo7, but provided that Epstein\ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl5o State v. Epstein, No. 2oo6-CF-9454, Notice of Hearing (Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Dec. 7, 2oo7).\nll Ina meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 2l, 2oo7, Lefkouitz informed them that Starr had placed\na call to Fisher.\n94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v. United States, No. 9:o8-cv-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 348\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3462\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3of6\n\ne AK’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is that the atorneys did not make any suggestions regarding what\ninvestigative steps SDNY should take.

R. Civ. P.\n3o(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct l7 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal\nsupport, Plaintiff atempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of\nseven hours with a right to take a total of 7o hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of\nthe Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and\nspeaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent\nlimitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.\n\nThe heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied\nPlaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth Amendment. This dashed Plaintiff's apparent\nhope to obtain an adverse inference, rather than actually having to prove her case against Ms.\nMaxwell. Instead, Ms. Maxwell fully testified for the entire 7 hours, responded to all questions\nposed to her,' and testified based on her actual knouledge. Ms. Maxwell’s testimony simply\nbears no relevance to Plaintiff's request to take more than lo depositions of non-party witnesses.\n\nConspicuously absent from Plaintiff's motion are (a) any actual information she believes\nthese witnesses may provide which is neither cumulative nor duplicative of other information\nalready disclosed in this case, (b) the fact the information can be obtained from other sources,\n\n' Plaintiff flatly mis-represents to the Court that Ms. Maxwell “refused” to answer the questions posed to\nher, as the actual transcript amply demonstrates. Ms. Maxwell did not avoid any questions and answered\nall questions to the best of her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> relating to alleged events l5 years ago. The majority of the\nbullet point “summary” of the maters about which Ms. Maxwell could not testify were based either on a\nlack of any personal knouledge or the fact that the events claimed by Plaintiff did not actually happen.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo of 349\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea.

These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 55 of 349\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 58 of 349\nwe are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.’ Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, ““Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.*8 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\nae Dershouitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6o of 349\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 62 of 349\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7l of 349\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand. After that concern was brought to my atention several\nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of\ncommand. ... If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\n\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims. If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to\ngive hope to more girls.\n\nAs far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone\nconclusion, I don’t knou of any case in the Office where an\ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict. And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently. I worked with\nthe agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment\npackage that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of\ncrimes have been commited. More importantly, I believe there is\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 88 of 349\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would strengthen the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 92 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°”\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 93 of 349\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2l of 349\n\nD. Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.”'“? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of this call, and Lourie also could\nl? The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2oo7, but provided that Epstein\ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl5o State v. Epstein, No. 2oo6-CF-9454, Notice of Hearing (Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Dec. 7, 2oo7).\nll Ina meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 2l, 2oo7, Lefkouitz informed them that Starr had placed\na call to Fisher.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4o of 349\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v. United States, No. 9:o8-cv-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Declaration of A. Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8o of 349\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ... to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafa\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o4 of 349\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect.

After [Cosby's] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the\npolice. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips\nthought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to\nobtain the records. Mr. Castor’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand\nafter the assault.

He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys.

He later testified that he did not have any specific\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382-7 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of7\n\ne AK’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is that the atorneys did not make any suggestions regarding what\ninvestigative steps SDNY should take. The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case.

Sean never\ncalled AK back. AK doesn’t recall ever affirmatively follouing up with Sean, but she\ntook the radio silence to mean that the FBI agents in Florida did not express\ndissatisfaction.\n\ne No investigation was opened as a result of the February 29, 2ol6 meeting.\n\ne No investigation into Epstein was opened while AK was the Human Trafficking\nCoordinator and Project Safe Childhood coordinator.\n\ne AK never met with any other Boies Schiller atorneys. AK does not recall ever speaking\nwith David Boies at any point.\n\ne AK never met with the atorneys from the February 29, 2ol6 meeting again.\n\ne When asked what, if any, communications AK had with the atorneys, AK noted that she\nsees an email from May 2ol6 with Stan Potenger. AK believes it’s possible Stan called\nAK, but she does not remember that.\n\ne AK does not recall any further conversations re Epstein in SDNY until much later when\nthe Miami Herald series was published.\n\nAK confirmed she has read the Daily News Article LP sent\n\ne AK indicated that the article did not accurately describe AK’s interactions with atorneys\nfor Virginia Roberts.\n\ne AK’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is not that atorneys urged SDNY to open an investigation into “the\nduo.” They were focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned in passing, not as a target.\n\ne AK did not participate in a second meeting with anyone. Had there been a meeting on\nthis subject in the summer of 2ol6 in SDNY, AK would have knoun about it in her\ncapacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\no AK had been in that role since approximately 2olo, and if someone came in to\nmeet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking mater, AK would get\ncontacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any\ncases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate. So\nif a second meeting had taken place with a supervisor in the office, AK would\nhave knoun about it. Dan Stein also would have brought AK in if he learned of a\nsecond meeting.\n\no AK would have made a record if there had ever been a second meeting. AK\nwould remember if there were a second meeting. She has no record and no\nmemory of any second meeting.\n\ne AK does not recall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life, so to her\nknouledge, Boies was not making any effort to persuade SDNY to investigate Epstein.\nAK noted it is possible Boies could have been on the phone if Stan Potinger called AK\nin or around May of 2ol6, but AK has no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of such a call.\n\ne AK does not recall the atorney presentation being framed on highlighting Maxwell’s\nassistance with Epstein’s sexual abuse. It was not presented as a “duo.” AK recalls the\nmention of a pilot and the mention of someone having an address book, so other people\nwere mentioned as part of telling the story of Epstein.\n\n4\nSDNY_GM_o274289o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo555o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382-7 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of7\n\ne AK did not express any concerns about anything to the atorneys. AK may have asked\nsomething like whether the atorneys are asking SDNY to re-do the Florida investigation\nbecause AK was trying to understand what the atorneys were proposing: was it looking\nat the same conduct that was investigated in Florida and mishandled, or was it looking at\ndifferent conduct and possibly ongoing conduct? AK recalls asking questions to clarify\nthat point.\n\ne AK is sure one of the things she asked would have been venue oriented to understand\nwhat the atorneys were describing and what the conduct was. AK would not have\nresponded to a question asking about why AK wouldn’t just open an investigation.\nPurpose of the meeting was for AK to understand what the atorneys were trying to\nconvey, not for AK to make any representation about her thoughts or what she was going\nto do.\n\ne Brad Edwards’s book suggesting that the AUSA seemed “confident that a case would be\nbrought” does not seem accurate to AK. AK did not intend to give such an impression\nduring the meeting. That decision is not one for AK to make alone, in any event.\n\ne AK does not recall any mention that the number of victims in NY far exceeded the\nnumber in Florida.\n\ne Brad Edwards’s description of wanting a case against Epstein is consistent with AK’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that the focus was on Epstein.\n\ne Ifanyone called AK, she does not remember that, and she would not have mentioned the\ncomity shoun to other USAOs around the country.\n\ne AK does not recall anyone ever approaching her to ask if SDNY would consider charging\nMaxwell with perjury.\n\no AK has a vague memory that the atorneys called or emailed AK at some point\nand told her that there had been depositions, presumably by contact from one of\nthese lawyers, but AK cannot recall the specifics. AK does not remember one\nway or the other if any of the atorneys referenced the possibility of perjury.\n\no AK recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have the same challenges.\nAK recalls thinking in her mind that if the depositions were about the underlying\nconduct that had all of the issues that gave AK pause after the meeting (length of\ntime that had passed, sense there must have been a reason SDFL resolved the case\nthe way they did) were not alleviated by a perjury-based prosecution.\n\no AK does not recall ever knouing anything about the substance of the depositions\nand does not remember anyone sending her a deposition transcript.\n\no AK does not remember who had been deposed or who might have been the\nsubject of a possible perjury investigation.\n\no No investigation into perjury was ever opened.\n\ne AK took no further action re Epstein after calling Sean Watson.\n\no Though there may be emails or calls AK cannot remember, she knous that she\ntook no action after the call to Sean Watson.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case. AK asked\n\n3\nSDNY_GM_o2742889\nDOJ-OGR-oooo65ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006512.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439-7 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of7\nSean to call AK back and let her knou if the Florida agents had concerns. Sean never\ncalled AK back. AK doesn’t recall ever affirmatively follouing up with Sean, but she\ntook the radio silence to mean that the FBI agents in Florida did not express\ndissatisfaction.\n\ne No investigation was opened as a result of the February 29, 2ol6 meeting.\n\ne No investigation into Epstein was opened while AK was the Human Trafficking\nCoordinator and Project Safe Childhood coordinator.\n\ne AK never met with any other Boies Schiller atorneys. AK does not recall ever speaking\nwith David Boies at any point.\n\ne AK never met with the atorneys from the February 29, 2ol6 meeting again.\n\ne When asked what, if any, communications AK had with the atorneys, AK noted that she\nsees an email from May 2ol6 with Stan Potenger. AK believes it’s possible Stan called\nAK, but she does not remember that.\n\ne AK does not recall any further conversations re Epstein in SDNY until much later when\nthe Miami Herald series was published.\n\nAK confirmed she has read the Daily News Article LP sent\n\ne AK indicated that the article did not accurately describe AK’s interactions with atorneys\nfor Virginia Roberts.\n\ne AK’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is not that atorneys urged SDNY to open an investigation into “the\nduo.” They were focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned in passing, not as a target.\n\ne AK did not participate in a second meeting with anyone. Had there been a meeting on\nthis subject in the summer of 2ol6 in SDNY, AK would have knoun about it in her\ncapacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\no AK had been in that role since approximately 2olo, and if someone came in to\nmeet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking mater, AK would get\ncontacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any\ncases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate. So\nif a second meeting had taken place with a supervisor in the office, AK would\nhave knoun about it. Dan Stein also would have brought AK in if he learned of a\nsecond meeting.\n\no AK would have made a record if there had ever been a second meeting. AK\nwould remember if there were a second meeting. She has no record and no\nmemory of any second meeting.\n\ne AK does not recall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life, so to her\nknouledge, Boies was not making any effort to persuade SDNY to investigate Epstein.\nAK noted it is possible Boies could have been on the phone if Stan Potinger called AK\nin or around May of 2ol6, but AK has no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of such a call.\n\ne AK does not recall the atorney presentation being framed on highlighting Maxwell’s\nassistance with Epstein’s sexual abuse. It was not presented as a “duo.” AK recalls the\nmention of a pilot and the mention of someone having an address book, so other people\nwere mentioned as part of telling the story of Epstein.\n\n4\nSDNY_GM_o274289o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo65l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439-7 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6of7\n\ne AK did not express any concerns about anything to the atorneys. AK may have asked\nsomething like whether the atorneys are asking SDNY to re-do the Florida investigation\nbecause AK was trying to understand what the atorneys were proposing: was it looking\nat the same conduct that was investigated in Florida and mishandled, or was it looking at\ndifferent conduct and possibly ongoing conduct? AK recalls asking questions to clarify\nthat point.\n\ne AK is sure one of the things she asked would have been venue oriented to understand\nwhat the atorneys were describing and what the conduct was. AK would not have\nresponded to a question asking about why AK wouldn’t just open an investigation.\nPurpose of the meeting was for AK to understand what the atorneys were trying to\nconvey, not for AK to make any representation about her thoughts or what she was going\nto do.\n\ne Brad Edwards’s book suggesting that the AUSA seemed “confident that a case would be\nbrought” does not seem accurate to AK. AK did not intend to give such an impression\nduring the meeting. That decision is not one for AK to make alone, in any event.\n\ne AK does not recall any mention that the number of victims in NY far exceeded the\nnumber in Florida.\n\ne Brad Edwards’s description of wanting a case against Epstein is consistent with AK’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that the focus was on Epstein.\n\ne Ifanyone called AK, she does not remember that, and she would not have mentioned the\ncomity shoun to other USAOs around the country.\n\ne AK does not recall anyone ever approaching her to ask if SDNY would consider charging\nMaxwell with perjury.\n\no AK has a vague memory that the atorneys called or emailed AK at some point\nand told her that there had been depositions, presumably by contact from one of\nthese lawyers, but AK cannot recall the specifics. AK does not remember one\nway or the other if any of the atorneys referenced the possibility of perjury.\n\no AK recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have the same challenges.\nAK recalls thinking in her mind that if the depositions were about the underlying\nconduct that had all of the issues that gave AK pause after the meeting (length of\ntime that had passed, sense there must have been a reason SDFL resolved the case\nthe way they did) were not alleviated by a perjury-based prosecution.\n\no AK does not recall ever knouing anything about the substance of the depositions\nand does not remember anyone sending her a deposition transcript.\n\no AK does not remember who had been deposed or who might have been the\nsubject of a possible perjury investigation.\n\no No investigation into perjury was ever opened.\n\ne AK took no further action re Epstein after calling Sean Watson.\n\no Though there may be emails or calls AK cannot remember, she knous that she\ntook no action after the call to Sean Watson. Part of the reason AK felt horrible\nwhen reading the Miami Herald article was because AK took no action after\ncalling Sean Watson.\n\n5\nSDNY_GM_o274289l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo65l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def.

Yes, many of the studies specifically look at disclosure\n\n2 that is delayed, as in not occurring at the time of the abuse.\n3 And then look at what are those rates at various points in\n\n4 time, so it could be a week later, it could be a month later,\n5 it could be a year later or five years later.\n\n6 Q. So those are all variables in this idea of when disclosure\n7 occurs; right?\n\n8 A. They are variables in the dynamics of the delay. They are\n9 all examples of delayed disclosure at various points in time.\nlo Because delayed disclosure refers to disclosure at some point\nll after the incident that's being disclosed.\n\nl2 Q.

Supp.\n2d ll4, ll7-l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (discussing requirements).!° As the Court has noted, any\nargument on that score must await the presentation of evidence. (See Nov. ll, 2o2l Sealed Tr., at\nl94). But at present, the defendant has identified no relevant fact testimony that Dr. Hall could\noffer. Because his expert testimony is similarly inadmissible, he should be excluded as a witness\nabsent further developments at trial.\n\nlo To be clear, although Dr. Hall could conceivably testify as to his <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of some prior\ninconsistent statement by Minor Victim-4, the rough transcript of his interview with her cannot\nbecome admissible as extrinsic evidence of Minor Victim-4’s statements regardless hou she\ntestifies. That label—“rough transcript”—comes from the document itself. (35o5-o35, at l). And\nit is quite obviously rough. The document contains numerous errors, including on material points.\n- Because the rough transcript is not a verbatim transcript, lt cannot be offered as extrinsic\nevidence of prior inconsistent statements.

Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, 29 (2d Cir.\nl992) (per curiam) (“[A] ‘third party’s characterization’ of a witness’s statement does not\nconstitute a prior statement of that witness unless the witness has subscribed to that\ncharacterization.”); United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to request a\nclarification of the Court’s instructions regarding the use of paper documents versus electronic\ndocuments at trial. In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will be permited to display\ndocuments used for impeachment or refreshing a witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> in electronic format solely on the\nvideo screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s deputy, or whether we will be required to\nprovide paper copies of these materials, even if the materials do not reference a witness who is testifying\nunder a pseudonym. !\n\nThe defense is sensitive to the Court and the government’s concerns that people siting in the\ngallery of the courtroom do not see any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under\npseudonyms. We also understand that the Court wants to ensure that the witnesses will have access to\nthe complete documents that may be used for impeachment and refreshing <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, rather than a\n' Counsel for the defense understood the discussion on November 23, 2o2l, to apply only to documents which\ncontained identifying information for witnesses who are testifying under pseudonyms or first names. The\ngovernment, houever, has suggested that paper documents need to be used for all impeachment and refreshing,\nwhether or not the documents contain such identifying information.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5ll Filed ll/27/2l Page 2 of 3\nparticular page. We have considered these concerns and would like to propose a solution that we\nbelieve will address these issues and safeguard the privacy interests of the witnesses, and at the same\ntime provide for an efficient trial and protect Ms. Maxwell’s rights.\n\nThe defense proposes that the parties be permited to display documents used for impeachment\nor refreshing <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> only on the video screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s\ndeputy. None of these screens face the gallery or the jury box and cannot be seen by anyone in the\naudience or by members of the jury. The documents will not be displayed on the screens at counsel\ntable, which face the gallery, or on the juror screens.\n\nWhile the defense may display a particular page of a document to the witness to impeach or\nrefresh <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, we will have the complete document available in electronic form. If the witness\nwishes to see other pages of the document, we can display those pages on the witness’s screen at the\nwitness’s request. Most importantly, this process will allou counsel to highlight or direct the witness’s\natention electronically to particular sections of the 35oo materials, without having to describe the\nparticular paragraph number or sentence in (sometimes) voluminous, dense, multi-page FBI 3o2 reports.\nAdditionally, it will ensure that the witness is looking at the correct exhibit, rather than at other potential\nimpeachment material in a binder before them, especially since defense counsel is not placed in a\nposition within the courtroom that permits us to see what exhibit or page the witness has open in front of\nthem on the witness stand. Finally, it will obviate the need to approach a witness, which is difficult with\nthe Covid protocols and courtroom set-up, to direct the witness to a particular exhibit or section of an\nexhibit.\n\nThe government has advised that it does not require copies of any of the 35oo materials or the\ngovernment exhibits.

(or evidence in one’s ‘case in\nchief’).” Moore, 2o8 F.3d at 579. In fact, so obviously wrong is the government’s interpretation\nof Rule l6 that, when the government offered the same argument in United States v. Moore,\nJudge Easterbrook concluded that the district court commited a plain error in excluding a leter\nthe defense offered into evidence while cross-examining a prosecution witness during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief. /d.\n\nThe government is also wrong to suggest that even if Ms. Maxwell did not have to\ndisclose statements used as impeachment while cross-examining a prosecution witness during\nthe government’s case-in-chief, she did have to disclose other exhibits used as impeachment,\nsuch as the photograph she offered into evidence while cross-examining Jane.

It was not until just before trial, after the\ngovernment had questioned her about the New Mexico trip in her preparation for trial, that Jane\nclaimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at\nthe ranch. See supra note l.\n\nJane’s new <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> about the New Mexico trip was disclosed at the eleventh hour\nand substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her defense. See id. (“The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.”). Because the Mann Act counts as charged in the Indictment were\nbased on a violation of New York law, the defense vigorously litigated the extent to which the\ngovernment could introduce evidence of sexual activity that occurred in jurisdictions outside of\nNew York in support of the Mann Act counts. As part of that effort, the defense requested\nlimiting instructions with respect to the testimony of Kate and Annie Farmer. The limiting\ninstructions, which were read to the jury immediately before the witnesses began their testimony,\nspecifically instructed the jury that any sexual conduct that Kate or Annie Farmer said occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein “was not ‘illegal sexual activity’ as the government has charged in the\nindictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2; Tr. 2o48:22-2o49:l.\n\nHad the defense been given sufficient notice that Jane would testify that she was sexually\nabused in New Mexico, we would have litigated this issue before trial and, at the very least,\nmade an application to the Court to give a limiting instruction before the start of Jane’s testimony\nsimilar to the one given for Annie Farmer, who also testified about a single instance of sexual\ncontact at the ranch in New Mexico when she was l6 years old, which could not have violated\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008955.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3l of 37\n\nA. Flight Records — Passenger Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal\nsexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the\njury to assess the accuracy of the witness’ recollections of events that had occurred over 2o years\nago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than l7 years old\nfor the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a passenger on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the passenger manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\ncommercial plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349. Annie Farmer testified that Epstein bought her a commercial ticket to fly\nto New Mexico in the spring of l996, which was the trip where she claimed she was given a\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 32 of 37\ntopless massage. Tr. 2o75. Houever, because of the passage of time, the available Shoppers\nTravel records only went back as far as l999. Tr. 2393. Asa result, the defense did not have\naccess to Shoppers Travel records to challenge Annie Farmer’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of when the trip to\nNew Mexico occurred. Likewise, Jane testified that she traveled with Epstein approximately ten\ntimes when she was under the age of l7 on both his private jet and on commercial flights, and\nthat she was first sexually abused in New York when she was l4. Tr. 3l6. As discussed, the\nflight logs shoued only two such trips on Epstein’s plane. The Shoppers Travel records would\nhave shed light on the number of commercial flights that Jane took when she was a minor and\ncould have been used to challenge her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of events, including whether she even\ntraveled to New York before she was l6 years old.\n\nB. Financial Documents — Bank Records and Credit Card Records\n\nCritical financial documents were also unavailable to the defense. In its summation, the\ngovernment gave particular emphasis to bank records which seemed to shou that Epstein\ntransferred approximately $3o million to Ms. Maxwell from l999-2oo7, arguing that it was Ms.\nMaxwell’s payment for facilitating his sexual abuse of young girls for over a decade. Tr. 284l,\n2884-85. Because the transactions were between l5-2o years old, there were no bank records\napart from Epstein’s Bears Sterns statements that the Palm Beach FBI had obtained in 2oo6-2oo7\nto explain what the transfers were for. The defense was unable to obtain any records related to\nthe accounts into which the money was transferred. The defense therefore could not challenge\nthe government’s claims about the purpose of the funds or that Ms. Maxwell even controlled the\naccounts.\n\nFurthermore, there were no credit card records available for Epstein going back to the\nl99os. Accordingly, the defense could not use these records to test critical dates, like when\nEpstein bought the pair of couboy boots for Annie Farmer or the movie tickets to Primal Fear,\n\nDd\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 34 of 37\nthe defense had substantial reason to believe that Epstein did not start living in the 7l Street\ntounhouse until the beginning of l996. Had property records for the 7l*' Street tounhouse been\navailable, they could have rebuted Jane’s testimony and challenged the accuracy of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>.\n\nSimilarly, when Jane testified about her trip to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she\nwas “l5 or l6,” she recalled staying at a “giant ranch sort of in the middle of nouhere ... [which]\nseemed very empty on the interior.” Tr. 32l. From her description, it is clear that Jane was\nreferring to the large ranch house that Epstein constructed on the property, and not the triple-\nwide trailer where he stayed while the large house was under construction. The defense had\nsignificant reason to believe that the large ranch house was not completed until the end of the\nl99os, when Jane would have been closer to l8 or l9 years old. But because property records\nshouing the dates of construction were not available, the defense could not challenge Jane’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> with contrary documentary evidence.\n\nE. Deceased Witnesses\n\nFinally, in the over 2o-year period that elapsed from the time of the charged conduct to\nthe time of trial, numerous potential witnesses who could have provided evidence contradicting\nthe government’s proof had died. In addition to the ones already mentioned in our previous\nfilings, the follouing individuals, among others, were no longer available to the defense:\n\ne Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi — Mr. Pinto and Mr. Salhi were architects who\nbuilt, renovated, and decorated many of Epstein’s residences, including the house\nin Palm Beach, the New York residence, and the ranch in New Mexico. The\ndefense believes they could have established (i) when Epstein moved into the 7l“\nStreet tounhouse and what it looked like inside over the relevant time period, (i)\nwhen the large ranch house was built, and (i) that the Palm Beach residence was\nbeing renovated for almost a year in the mid-l99os and that Epstein had to move\ninto a rental house during renovation. All of this evidence would have cast\nsignificant doubt on Jane’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of events.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page6ofl3\nwhen questioned about his answers to the Jury Questionnaire; therefore Juror 5o has a\ncompelling need to be able to separately confirm his <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>—regardless of whether or not\nthere may exist a lapse in such <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>—and to be fully prepared to explain himself, as may\nbe necessary, pursuant to an inquiry directed by the order of this Court.

Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater.

Given Juror No. 5o’s personal experience and belief about memory and its\nreliability, there was no way he could fairly evaluate Ms. Maxwell’s challenge to the\ncredibility of her accusers’ memories or the expert testimony of Dr. Loftus.'*\n\nSeveral decisions support this conclusion. In Sampson v. United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68. But because the\njuror had not told the truth during voir dire, she was seated on a jury in a case involving a\nbank robbery in which the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These\nparallels,” the Court said, “raise a serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in\n[the juror’s] shoes would be able to disregard her oun experiences in evaluating the\nevidence.” Jd.\n\nTo be sure, the juror in Sampson did not limit her false answers to a single\nquestion. She also answered falsely to several other questions during voir dire, some\nmaterial and some not. /d. at l62-63, l66. A combination of factors led the First Circuit\nto affirm the order for a new penalty-phase hearing. /d. at l68. Here, Juror No. 5o’s false\n\nJuror No. 5o’s confidence in his memory is not necessarily a predictor of the\nmemory’s reliability. As Dr. Loftus testified, “when you have post-event suggestion or\nintervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers, and you can see that\neven wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high\ndegree of confidence.” TR at 243o.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009183.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad she WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ma fOntihe\nSEMENT Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Pale Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex alfensier .\ning behavi d di ly imoli dj most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\nOreeming Denaviet ana WEE-NS!

As\na factual mater, the record is crystal clear that these witnesses were not with the defendant and\nEpstein at “every moment” during the period charged in the Indictment. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *4. It would thus be “impossible” for them “to testify that [the] defendant did not\ncommit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful testimony [they] might have offered (the details\nof which are sparse in the motion) would be easily undermined on cross-examination.” /d. (citing\nSpears, l59 F.3d at lo8l-85). Moreover, even assuming that these witnesses would have testified\nas the defendant claims and that such testimony would have been admissible, the defendant does\nnot address why the unavailability of these particular individuals has caused her actual prejudice\nwhen other employees who worked for Epstein and the defendant were available to offer (and did\noffer) testimony about Epstein’s residences and the defendant’s role and time spent at such\nresidences. It is the defendant’s burden to establish that these witnesses’ testimony could not be\nput before the jury through other means, and the defendant has not established—and cannot\nestablish—that these four witnesses were “key” witnesses who would have testified at her trial in\nan irreplaceable way that would have helped, rather than hurt, her. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752.\n\nIn particular, the defendant cites the absence of Pinto and Salhi, “architects who built,\nrenovated, and decorated many of Epstein’s residences” and speculates that their testimony “would\nhave cast significant doubt on Jane’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of events.” (Def.

(Tr. l72). Similarly, Rodgers\ntestified that he turned over the passenger manifests that he completed to one of Epstein’s\natorneys. (Tr. l8l9). The defendant has not established that such manifests were not available\ndue to any intentionally manufactured delay. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F.

In Sampson v. United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68. But because the\njuror had not told the truth during voir dire, she was seated on a jury in a case involving a\nbank robbery in which the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These\nparallels,” the Court said, “raise a serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in\n[the juror’s] shoes would be able to disregard her oun experiences in evaluating the\nevidence.” Jd.\n\nTo be sure, the juror in Sampson did not limit her false answers to a single\nquestion. She also answered falsely to several other questions during voir dire, some\nmaterial and some not. /d. at l62-63, l66. A combination of factors led the First Circuit\nto affirm the order for a new penalty-phase hearing. /d. at l68.

The government’s claim is based solely on (l) Carolyn’s vague\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that she stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein in 2oo5 when she was\nl8 years old (Tr. l525, l549), and (2) two message pad slips that were never admited in\nevidence. (GX 4-B, GX 4-F). Such meager and unreliable evidence is insufficient to support a\nfinding that the offense conduct continued into the last two months of 2oo4, especially when that\ndetermination has such a significant effect on the recommended sentencing range. Instead, the\ncredible evidence in the trial record established, at most, that Epstein was receiving sexualized\nmassages in his Palm Beach residence through the summer of 2oo4, before the 2oo4 Guidelines\ntook effect.\n\nCarolyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that she was l8 when she stopped seeing Epstein cannot be\ncredited. (Tr. l525, l549). Carolyn’s memory of the timeline of events—in particular, her age\nat the time of the relevant events—was demonstrably inconsistent and unreliable. For example,\nCarolyn initially testified that she was l4 years old when Virginia Roberts first took her to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence, which would have been in 2ool. (Tr. l5l8-l9, l525; GX-ll).\nHouever, when Carolyn was confronted on cross-examination with her prior deposition\ntestimony in 2oo9, she agreed that Virginia first took her to Epstein’s house in May or June 2oo2\nwhen she was l5 years old, as she stated in her deposition. (Tr. l57o-73). Then on redirect\nCarolyn changed her testimony yet again and testified that she first went to Epstein’s house when\nshe was l3 years old, which would have been in 2ooo. (Tr. l693). Carolyn also testified that\nshe was “l5, going to be l6” when she recruited her friend Tatum to give Epstein massages,\nwhich would have been touards the end of 2oo2 or early 2oo3. (Tr. l544). Houever, according\nto the message pad slips that were admited in evidence, the earliest of which dates to January\n2oo3, Tatum did not begin calling the Palm Beach residence until April 2oo4 when Carolyn was\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page lo of 29\nl7. (GX-3-B). Carolyn further testified that she had trouble remembering details of the events\nin question and affirmed that she “[doesn’t] remember the times and dates” of her visits to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (Tr. l525, l559).\n\nThe government asserts that Carolyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> can be credited because even if she\ncannot recall the year that an event took place, she has been consistent about hou old she was\nwhen the event took place. (PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by\nthe record. If Carolyn could not accurately remember hou old she was when she first met\nEpstein, the Court should not credit her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of hou old she was when she last saw him.\n\nCarolyn’s memory of when she stopped seeing Epstein was not only unreliable, but also\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last\ninteractions with Epstein were when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on\nMarch l4, 2oo4. (Tr. l548-49). Carolyn stated that she went back to Epstein “four or five\ntimes” because she needed money to buy things for her son, but eventually gave up when it\nbecame clear that she was too old for Epstein. (Tr. l549).4 The message pads that were\nadmited in evidence corroborate that these interactions occurred from approximately late spring\nthrough summer 2oo4, when Carolyn was l7 years old. (See GX-3-E (undated message from\n“Carolyn Andriano”; surrounded by messages dated April 29 and May 2 and included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-3-I (July 6 message from “Caroline Ambriano”; included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-l-B (July 3o message from “Carolyn Andriano”; next to a message\ndated August l2, 2oo4 and included in a book of messages from 2oo4). Accordingly, the trial\n* Carolyn’s memory of her interactions with Epstein around the time of the Georgia interlude was also inconsistent\nand contradictory. On the one hand, Carolyn testified that she left Florida in 2oo3 “to escape the traumatic events”\nthat had happened in Palm Beach and traveled to Georgia where she became pregnant with her child. (Tr. l548-49,\nl6l7, l668). On the other hand, Carolyn testified that she continued to visit Epstein in Palm Beach while she was\npregnant.

The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\nconviction’ for ex post facto purposes and ... Application Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\nreasonable to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 Guidelines. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 Guidelines to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\nnevertheless vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 Guidelines apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier Guidelines were in effect.

(Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense.

Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833).

So the government is -- he didn't say that that photo\n\n8 was there.\n\n9 So I mean the government is making the argument that\nlo these important people may have seen these photographs or the\nll fact the photograph was there contradicts the defense argument\nl2 that the people in Epstein's orbit would have knoun about this,\nl3 including Ms. Maxwell, but we actually don't have any testimony\nl4 that the photo was on the wall at the time that's relevant to\nl5 this case.\n\nl6 THE COURT: We have testimony of Jane regarding art\nl7 and photographs.\nl8 MR.

Could you please explain to the jury what that means.\n\n9 A. So one of the things that memory scientists have discovered\nlo about memory distortion is that we humans frequently remember\nll ourselves in a beter light than perhaps is accurate. So there\nl2 are studies shouing that people remember their grades were\nl3 beter than they really were, that they voted in elections they\nl4 didn't vote in, that they gave more to cater than they really\nl5 gave, that their kids walked and talked at an earlier age than\nl6 they really did. These are prestige enhancing memory\nl7 distortions that people routinely make when they're not\nl8 deliberately lying, but maybe it makes them feel a litle\nl9 beter about themselves.\n\n2o (Continued on next page)\n2l\n22\n23\n24\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3o of l97 257l\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl remember if the witness --\n\n2 THE COURT: It's fine.\n\n3 MS.

So that is not -- that is clear under\n\niy Second Circuit law, that they have to supervise another\n\n6 criminal participant, and it's clear from the guidelines too,\n\n7 as the government concedes.\n\n8 Let's just talk a bit about Sarah Kellen. I don't\n\n9 think it is a fair inference to say from the trial record that\nlo Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen. In fact, the\n\nll inference is exactly the opposite. And you can rely on\n\nl2 Carolyn's testimony alone for that; that she herself testified\nl3 that there was a clear break between when she says that\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell was calling her to schedule for massage\n\nl5 appointments versus when Sarah Kellen took over and scheduled\nl6 for massage appointments. They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 emoloyment, to his <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really\n\n8 didn't knou what her role was, and his best <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> was\n\n9 that she was an assistant for Epstein.\n\nlo And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's\n\nll testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she\nl2 says unequivocally, \"I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's\nl3 assistant.\" So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was\nl4 supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the\n\nl5 opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership\n\nl6 enhancement.\n\nl7 THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the\n\nl8 enhancements for the government's objection?\n\nl9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect\n2o to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's\n2l atention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the\n22 testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after\n23 Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell\n24 was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn\n25 arrived for massage appointments.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool478o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014997.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page l2l of l58l2l\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl A.

Could you please explain to the jury what that means.\n\n9 A. So one of the things that memory scientists have discovered\nlo about memory distortion is that we humans frequently remember\nll ourselves in a beter light than perhaps is accurate. So there\nl2 are studies shouing that people remember their grades were\nl3 beter than they really were, that they voted in elections they\nl4 didn't vote in, that they gave more to cater than they really\nl5 gave, that their kids walked and talked at an earlier age than\nl6 they really did. These are prestige enhancing memory\nl7 distortions that people routinely make when they're not\nl8 deliberately lying, but maybe it makes them feel a litle\nl9 beter about themselves.\n\n2o (Continued on next page)\n2l\n22\n23\n24\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3o of l97 257l\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl remember if the witness --\n\n2 THE COURT: It's fine.\n\n3 MS.

As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021228.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Na 3536o38, Paged6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 348\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment. That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges. *!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was... a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[M]arie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou.

During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.48 On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021235.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON eL 3536o38, Page63 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him.* Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“narticularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021244.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page/2 of 258\nSA-7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment.

My <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered.\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims. If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to\ngive hope to more girls.\nAs far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone\nconclusion, I don’t knou of any case in the Office where an\ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict. And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently. I worked with\nthe agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment\npackage that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of\ncrimes have been commited.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.?® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, ““You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means .. . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n38 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like... this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n99 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021265.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOL 3536o38, Page93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. ©’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about... a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . .. that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021266.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E92 3536o38, Page94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, ‘““Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” l°\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”'”’ The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nl9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021294.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l3o | 3536o38, Pagel22 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2o of 348\n\nD. Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” *” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'°! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of this call, and Lourie also could\nl49 The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2oo7, but provided that Epstein\ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl5o State v. Epstein, No. 2oo6-CF-9454, Notice of Hearing (Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Dec. 7, 2oo7).\nIsl In a meeting with Acosta and Sloman on November 2l, 2oo7, Lefkouitz informed them that Starr had placed\na call to Fisher.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021313.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”'’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021353.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel8l of 258\nSA-l79\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 348\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, lasked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, ... “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ...to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021377.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o3 3536o38, Page2o5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 348\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “‘pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

That\nwould have sent them thru the roof.” Lourie explained to OPR that he thought a judge, after seeing\nan indictment charging the full nature and scope of Epstein’s conduct, might not agree to a plea\ninvolving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges.\"!\n\nLourie told OPR that despite Oosterban’s favorable opinion of the case, “[t]his was ...a\nbit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were unlike the case law Oosterban had cited.\nAlthough Lourie had some concerns about the legal issues and about the witnesses, he “probably”\ndid not see any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Lourie “was not in favor of\nwalking away, which is what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought\nwe could have won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were\nnearly as good as you want in a criminal case, and . . . the things that we had to gain [through a\nplea agreement] were much more than [in] a normal criminal case,” in which the only cost of a\nloss would be that the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment. On May lo, 2oo7, Lourie emailed Villafafia:\n\n[Marie\n\nI believe that Epstein’s at[orneys] are scared of the victims they\n\ndon’t knou. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were many.\n\nThus I believe the flir]st indictment should contain only the victims\n\nthey have nothing on at all. We can add in the other ones that have\n\nmyspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a [superseding\n\nindictment]. I think for the first strike we should make all their\n\nnightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”\n4 Lourie explained to OPR that the government’s dismissal of counts in an indictment required the court’s\napproval, and that, while “it’s rare,” it was possible that a judge, seeing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as\nset forth in an extensive indictment, might not allou substantive counts to be dismissed.\n“2 Lourie’s references to MySpace pages and “prior testimony” referred to the impeachment information\nbrought forward by defense counsel.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023069.jpg": "we are contemplating so Dershouitz can tell us why they don’t apply.”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I\ndon’t see the dounside,” but added, “Marie is against it.” Menchel responded that it was\n“premature” to provide the information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically\nrecall why he believed it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,\nbut speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for\nAcosta to have made a decision about hou he wanted to proceed. This <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is consistent\nwith the May 2oo7 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2oo7, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a leter to “confirm” that\nEpstein’s atorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached\na final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the leter to Menchel and Sloman, but\nnoted that Epstein’s defense team was “really ready for the next level,” rather than another meeting\nwith him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex\nwould be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.” Lourie also emailed\nLefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,\nand suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie’s emails shou that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers\nmeeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that\nMenchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafafia on the afternoon of\nMay 23, 2oo7.*° On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned to send to\nSloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although\nthe email was writen for Sloman and Menchel, Villafafia sent it as a draft only to her immediate\nsupervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to hou to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Mat — I just want to again voice my disagreement with\n\npromising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or\n\nany other of Epstein’s atorneys. As I mentioned, this is not a case\n\nwhere we will be siting doun to negotiate whether a defendant will\n\nserve one year versus two years of probation. This is a case where\n\nthe defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison\n\ntime. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently than\n\nthey would handle a probation-type case, we need to handle this case\n\ndifferently. Part of our prosecution strategy was already disclosed\n\nat the last meeting, and I am concerned that more will be disclosed\n\nat a future meeting.\n\nMy co-chair . . . who has prosecuted more of these cases than the\n\nrest of us combined and who actually worked on the drafting of\n\nsome of the child exploitation statutes, also opposes a meeting. We\n\nhave been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our\n‘te Dershouitz had jomed Lefcourt and Sanchez in representing Epstein for the federal case.\n48 During her OPR interview, Villafafia could not recall the meeting with specificity, but believed the purpose\nwas to discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,\ntold OPR that he could not remember anything specific about the meeting.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023071.tif": "for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023073.tif": "Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n“4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023075.tif": "include concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney], but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°*® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “‘non-starter.””> Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”*? Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\n37 Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9° In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023082.tif": "e-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand. After that concern was brought to my atention several\nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of\ncommand. ... If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a black box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims.

And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span>. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023103.tif": "Villafafia told OPR that during the meeting, the group discussed the draft NPA, but she did\nnot think they gave a copy to Krischer and Belohlavek. Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcem about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts identified in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about... a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023104.tif": "going to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !8\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023132.jpg": "D. Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea\n\nThe addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the mater entered a new,\nprotracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the\nfact that Epstein and his atorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing\nto senior Department managers with the goal of seting aside the NPA entirely. Although\nultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.\n\nOn October 29, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted\nSloman to address with Lefkouitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA\nrequired Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply\nwith the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing\npostponement from October 26 to November 2o. Responding to Lefkouitz’s atempts to limit the\nUSAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO\nneeded to be able to communicate with the State Atorney’s Office and the victims’ atorney “to\n[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”\n\nThat same day, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge\nassigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2oo8. Belohlavek\nassured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that\nwas agreed on by all for the sentencing.” '*? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month\nshou that the USAO, the State Atorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate\nregarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2oo8\ndate for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that\nEpstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various\npotential dates, on December 7, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of\nHearing, seting the case for January 4, 2oo8.!°°\n\nE. Epstein Seeks Departmental Review of the NPA’s § 2255 Provision Relating to\n\nMonetary Damages for the Victims\n\nWith Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of\nthe NPA, this time within the Department. On November l6, 2oo7, Epstein atorney Kenneth Starr\ncalled the office of Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a\nmessage that he was calling regarding Epstein.'*! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late\nSeptember 2oo7 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,\nreturned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of this call, and Lourie also could\nse The NPA had required Epstein’s plea and sentencing to occur by October 26, 2oo7, but provided that Epstein\ncould report to begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl5o State v.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\na7 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023183.tif": "and guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.tif": "record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023191.tif": "In its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “TI always figured Mat just wanted ... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023215.tif": "the federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence.

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.””» Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment.

Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.7”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n289 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023296.tif": "In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023298.tif": "Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].”\"”\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember.

Alfredo\nand I reflect life’s issues and family maters as best fas] a Colombian and\nEnglish speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture\nspeaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his <span class=\"highlight\">recollection</span> of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233\n"};
