On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

Despite the fact that the term\n“United States” has a widely accepted meaning in\nperhaps every other context, when this term is used in\na plea agreement, it means something different in\nNew Jersey than it does across the river in New York\nCity. A criminal defendant who, after receiving a\npromise that he will not be prosecuted again by the\nUnited States, pleads guilty to resolve all criminal\nliability, is not in fact resolving all criminal liability\nbecause the United States remains free to prosecute\nhim anew so long as it does so in the Second or Seventh\nCircuits.\n\nThis Court should resolve this conflict, ensuring that\nplea agreements are enforced consistently throughout\nthe United States so that when the United States\nmakes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that\npromise.\n\nI. The circuits are split as to whether a promise\non behalf of the “United States” or the\n“Government” by a United States Atorney’s\noffice in one district is binding upon United\nStates Atorney’s offices in other districts.\n\nIn Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l), this\nCourt held that a prosecutor’s promise in a plea\nagreement binds other prosecutors, even those who\nmight have been unaware of the promise. 4o4 U.S.\nat 262. “Th[e] circumstances will vary, but a constant\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooooo49", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000060.jpg": "l8\nOPR report, precludes <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Annabi in this\ncase because the intent to bind the United States as a\nwhole, and not just the Southern District of Florida, is\nclear.\n\nThird, the Second Circuit misplaced its reliance on\na selective reading of the Judiciary Act of l789 and the\nUnited States Atorneys’ Manual to conclude that\nUnited States Atorneys are “cabined to their specific\ndistrict unless otherwise directed.” ll8 F.4th at 265.\nYet the Second Circuit ignored the Manual’s admoni-\ntion that United States Atorneys who do not wish to\nbind other districts should explicitly limit the scope of\na non-prosecution agreement to their districts.

The existence of this provision reveals\nthat AUSAs can bind other districts and that it is the\nobligation of the government to make explicit any\nlimitation in the scope of immunity, and not the other\nway around.\n\nFourth, the recitals of the NPA reveal that the\nintent was for a broad, complete resolution of the\nmaters addressed by the agreement. The NPA states\nthat “Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and\nfederal criminal liability.” (App.25). It also states that\n“the interests of the United States, the State of Florida,\nand the Defendant will be served” by the agreement.\n(App.25-26, emphasis added).

The Third Circuit reached the same\nconclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl96 (8d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the\nreasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-conviction contexts of criminal sentencing\nand immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal conviction. Id. at 59. “The language of § 32838,\nby contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That\nlinguistic expansion indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case. This reading accords with a robust\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool27", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000131.jpg": "68a\n\nthat it apply to prosecutions for offenses commited\nbefore the date of enactment. Instead of simply\nproviding a new limitations period for future conduct,\nCongress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses\nwill apply. That is, it prevents the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of any\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise apply to\npast conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other\nstatutes employing similar language. The Eighth\nCircuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283,\nwhich alloued prosecution of sex crimes against\nchildren until the victim reached age twenty-five,\napplied to past conduct. See United States v. Jeffries,\n4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second\nCircuit has observed that the Higher Education\nTechnical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L.

That\nstatute eliminated the statute of limitations for claims\non defaulted student loans by stating that “no\nlimitation shall terminate the period within which suit\nmay be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is\nquite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to\napply the extended limitations period as broadly as the\nConstitution allous. With each successive amendment\nto the statute, Congress further extended the limitations\nperiod, recognizing that sex crimes against children\n“may be difficult to detect quickly” because children\noften delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.

Instead, she contends that because the House\nversion of the bill included an express retroactivity\nprovision absent from its final form, the Court should\ninfer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply\nto past conduct. Houever, the legislative history makes\nclear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have\nproduced unconstitutional results. The Supreme Court\nhas explained that a law that revives a time-barred\nprosecution violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the\nConstitution, but a law that extends an un-expired\nstatute of limitations does not. Stogner v. California,\n5389 U.S. 6o7, 632-83 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who\ncosponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in\na commitee report that the proposed retroactivity\nprovision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it\n“would have revived the government’s authority to\nprosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.”\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l87, S5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3)\n(statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the\nprovision shortly thereafter for this reason. The\nremoval of the express retroactivity provision shous\nonly that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT\nAct to its constitutional applications, including past\nconduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of\nlimitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s\namendment to § 3283 reflect that it applies Maxwell’s\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000133.jpg": "7oa\nconduct charged in the $l superseding indictment.\nThe Court could stop here.

Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any\nvested rights.

Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a\ncombination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the\nsafety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed\nsupra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nYours truly,\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)-5o6-39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6-395o\nrweingarten@steptoe.com\nMartin G.

Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy.

These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

And I'm going to go over\n\n7 them with you right nou so that before the government and the\n\n8 defense speaks, they will knou what questions I would like them\n9 to address, if they wish to. Otherwise, they can say whatever\nlo they wish. But these are questions that I have on my mind.\n\nll So the first question is this. It involves some\n\nl2 discussion that I would like each side to address. As you\n\nl3 knou, this case involves two counts or two charges.\n\nl4 These are allegations contained in the indictment.\n\nl5 One is conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. And the other,\n\nl6 the second count, is the substantive count of sex trafficking.\nl7 The referenced statute is l8 U.S. Code, Section l59l. And for\nl8 our purposes, Since this is a bail proceeding, also the Bail\n\nl9 Reform Act.\n2o Section l59l, as is relevant here -- those cases are\n2l unusual in the criminal law insofar as they carry with them a\n22 presumption that \"No condition or combination of conditions\n23 will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required\n24 and the safety of the community.\"\n25 As you probably knou already, most cases carry a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo5l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000516.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 _ Filed o7/24/l9 Page 6 of 74 6\n\nl presumption that bail will be granted. That is not true with\n\n2 respect to the charges here.\n\n3 The presumption of remand, as in this case, may be\n\n4 rebuted by the defense. And if it is, the government has the\n5 burden of proving that remand is nevertheless warranted.\n\n6 Indeed, the government bears this burden of persuasion\n\n7 throughout.\n\n8 The burden with respect to the safety of the community\n9 is clear and convincing evidence, and the burden with respect\nlo to risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence.\n\nll The defense argues that the presumption of remand is\nl2 rebuted here. And I refer to several places where they say\n\nl3 that, but one is at page 6 and follouing of their leter\n\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for release of Mr. Epstein.\n\nl5 So my question as relates to this burden and\n\nl6 presumption is for the defense particularly, hou was the burden\nl7 rebuted in this case which is something that they contend\n\nl8 they've been able to do.\n\nl9 And my question for the government is whether that\n2o presumption has been rebuted and, if so, hou has the\n2l government been able to prove remand is appropriate, if it has.\n22 So here is another question. Actually, I have a lot\n23 of questions. But the ones that are on top of my mind are\n24 five. We have all the time in the world. So if you have more\n25 questions, I'd be happy to have them answered.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo5l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000517.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 7 of 74 7\n\nl So the question is the follouing: Mr. Epstein has\n\n2 been required to register as a sex offender in several states\n\n5 going back I believe to 2oo8 when he pled guilty to an offense\n4 in Florida.\n\n5 Those states include New York, Florida, and the Virgin\n6 Islands.

The state Supreme Court has even concluded\n\nl4 that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides\nl5 the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of\n\nl6 abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and\nl7 its constitution nou require the criminal justice system to\n\nl8 accommodate the rights of crime victims. Further, that the\n\nl9 abatement of criminal convictions has important implications\n2o for these rights.\n2l But coming back to our case, which is what you are\n22 concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude\n23 that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant\n24 as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the\n25 Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo647", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000648.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page lo of 86 lo\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction.\n\n2 So that's just some background I wanted to share with\n3 you.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The arrest and bail applications\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2o2o and since that\ndate has been detained in jaw-droppingly appalling conditions. The\ngovernment claims that Ms. Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s “associate”\nand helped him “groom” minors for sex back in the l99os and early\n2ooos. Doc. l87. The indictment does not name these accusers and the\ngovernment has refused to disclose their names or the specific dates\nthat Ms. Maxwell supposedly did anything criminal.\n\nAfter her arrest, the government moved for detention. Ex.A. The\ndefense responded. Ex.B. And the government replied. Ex.C. The trial\njudge held the arraignment and bond hearing over Zoom. Ex.D. The\ngovernment did not call any of the accusers in the indictment or present\nany witnesses related to flight, danger, or the strength of its case. The\ngovernment conceded that it was not asking for detention based on\ndanger to the community. The court ordered Ms. Maxwell detained at\nthe conclusion of the hearing.

Jd. at 82-87.\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a second motion for bail and addressed each of\nthese concerns. Ex.E. For starters, the defense explained that none of\nanonymous accusers’ testimony of abuse was corroborated and that it\nall related to Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell. In addition, Ms. Maxwell does\nhave significant ties to the United States, her assets were thoroughly\ndisclosed and veted, and she is willing to waive extradition. The\ngovernment responded. Ex.F. The defense replied. Ex.G. The judge\nagain denied bail, relying, for the second time, on the “strong” evidence,\neven though no evidence was presented to the court to rely on.4\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a third motion for bail. Ex.I. In this <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>,\nshe offered to renounce her foreign citizenship and also to have her\nl Ms. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from this Order, which is\ndocketed in Case No. 2l-58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo922", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000931.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page2l of 3l\nrequires relief.

The trial court erred in relying on the government’s\nproffer—which comprised nothing but old, anonymous,\nunconfronted, hearsay accusations—to refuse to set\nreasonable bail for Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe government stressed the strength of its case in seeking\ndetention, highlighting the “strength of the Government’s evidence” on\npage l of its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for detention.

Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong\nbecause “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell).\n\nOf course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v.\nGiampino, 68o F.2d 898, 9ol n. 3 (2d. Cir. l982). Every circuit with\npublished patern instructions inform juries that they are not to\nconsider the indictment as evidence.

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case.

As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'°\n'6 Tn United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000982.jpg": "Case F-26-4rBOBSHAURDSeuMEeNt IE Hied GPA B2o Pagerse of 28o\n\nMs. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal\ncircumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for detention.

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo994", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000997.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGvsnt DOM 2o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage aB26lol9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

Moreover, she has citizenship in\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo997", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000998.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGuisnt DOM 22o FilesoOAI3o2 aPage aM26lol9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v.

The MDC’s response to the pandemic was the subject of\nextensive evidentiary hearings in the context ofa civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York.\nSee Chunn v. Edge, No. 2o Cr. l59o, 2o2o WL 3o55669 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2o2o).

And the data—\nthough limited—suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-l9\nthus far.”).\n\nNumerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on assertions\nabout the hypothetical risks of COVID-l9, including multiple cases involving defendants who,\nunlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions.

(See Exs. A-N, W-X).

As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents | or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates.

Nevertheless, she has “no hesitation” posting her home because she knous “in every\nfibre of | her] being” that Ms. Maxwell “will never try to flee.” (/d.).\n\nSimilarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes:\n\nThis amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my\n\nhome es If I lost these assets\n\nbecause Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be\n\nfinancially ruined.

The head of the security company has confirmed that they have never done this\nfor a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company’s “long-\nstanding relationship with Ms. Maxwell” and because he is “confident that she will not try\nto flee.” (Ex. S).\n\nIn sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her\nfamily and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live\nwithout constant media harassment to support her. (See Ex.

The Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001158.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect 6 Gb 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll58", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001165.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck 3 Ob 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001166.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deagec? 4 Ob 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001169.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deageck 7l Ob 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001171.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck I Ob 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001174.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagecs A Ob 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001182.jpg": "CaSesk2o-ef (oo S3oc Aden (Dec Ante) l6o2l , BiB D2ol 872oePlage Hof 4\n\nLarticle 3 du Traite bilateral d’extradition signe le 23 avril l996 entre les Etats-Unis\nd’Amerique et la France stipule que «/Etat requis n'est pas tenu daccorder Textradition de l'un de ses\nressortassants, mais le Pouvoir executif des Etats-Unis a la Jaculte de te faire, discretionnairement, sil le fuse\napproprie ».\n\nEn <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> de ce Traite et du principe general de non-extradition des nationaux en dtoit\nfrancais, la France tefuse systematiquement d’accorder Vextradition de ressortissants francais aux\nautorites judiciaires americaines tandis que les autorites americaines acceptent regulierement d’extrader\nleurs ressortissants vers la France.\n\nIl convient de faire observer que le principe de non-extradition des nationaux vaut non\nseulement a legard des Etats-Unis mais egalement de tous les autres Etats A Pexception des Etats-\nmembres de Union europeenne, aux termes de la loi du 9 mars 2oo4 transposant la decision-cadre\ndu l3 juin 2oo2 sur le mandat d’arret europeen qui prevoit que la remise de la personne reclamee ne\npourra pas etre refusee au seul motif de sa nationalite francaise.\n\nCe temperament au principe de non-extradition des nationaux s’inscrit dans le contexte\npaticulier de la construction de espace judiciaire europeen qui s’inscrit lui-meme dans un processus\nd’integration politique tres specifique entre les Etats-membres de l’Union europeenne.

And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks.

The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July l4,\n2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the\nDefendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would\nensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied.\nThe Defendant has nou filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which\nthe Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\nhave been made then.

Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3). As a non-citizen, Ms.\nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool234", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001235.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF iG 82228 /2 49 Peigef 3 Ob 9\ncitizens of those countries. The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool235", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001236.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCuMentl l6o2 lFik6G 82728 /2 49 Pagel 4 Ob 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool236", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001237.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCuMentl l6o2 lF iG 82228 /2 49 Pagel 5 Ob 9\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to\nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense.\nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of\nwaivers of extradition. (See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6).

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec.

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001261.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiKRGS3S2e/Raghageor 6648\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets.

Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument.

The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o.

Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

Among other things,\nthe Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three from l994 through 2oo4 and specifically identified a fourth\nvictim of those conspiracies. The additional charges strengthen the evidence against\nMaxwell and further support Judge Nathan’s detention orders.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool32o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001325.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88).

On December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for bail,\npresenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After\nconsidering multiple writen submissions (Ex.

At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic.

Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement.

As the Government has explained in oral and writen proffers,\nthe allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of\nthree different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-lo). Each\nvictim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-\nwitnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence,\nincluding flight records, diary entries, and other evidence. (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F\nat lo-l2).\n\nll. Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District\nCourt, each of which was thoroughly briefed. Judge Nathan denied all three\napplications in careful and thorough decisions.\n\nl2. First, after receiving extensive writen submissions from the\nparties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o, at which\nshe heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims. Judge\nNathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and\nexplained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Ex. D at 79-9l). In reaching\nthis decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense\nhere weigh in favor of detention” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this\nearly juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83). Among other\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001446.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page6 of 24\nthings, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections\nabroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool446", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001447.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page/7 of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at l-2). Among other things,\nJudge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of\nthe Government’s proffer of evidence. (/d. at lo). Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6). Additionally, Judge Nathan was\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool447", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001448.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5.

See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001459.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel9 of 24\nnightime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to\nthe ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her\nfrom being able to prepare her defense.*\n\n36. It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool459", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001460.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001485.jpg": "4 o4 Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2 Filed o7/o2/2o Page l of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA | Unsealing Order\n_¥ 2o Cr. 33o\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, |\nDefendant.\n\nUpon the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the United States, by the Acting United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York, Audrey Strauss, by Assistant United States Atorney\nAlex Rossmiller;\n\nIt is found that the Indictment in the above-captioned case is currently sealed and the United\nStates Atorney’s Office has applied to have that Indictment unsealed, and it is therefore:\n\nORDERED that the Indictment in the above-captioned action be unsealed and remain\nunsealed pending further order of the Court.\n\nDated: New York, New York\nJuly 2, 2o2o\nKatha A tab, Qin be\nH RABLE KATHARINE H.

See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l2 of 26\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n° Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n\n’ The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool592", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 24 of 26\n3. The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas aresult of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'®\n\"© In United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Jd. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 25 of 26\n\nMs. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal\ncircumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in\nconnection with this bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them\nand their families from harm.\n\nThe proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this\nCircuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v.\nEsposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family\nwho was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions),\naff'd, 749 F.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001620.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page lo of l9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.” Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n? The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l3 of l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized\ncitizen who was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum\nof 2o years’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369\nF. App’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nThe defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate\nfamily members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her\nsiblings, as her time in hiding makes clear, she is clearly capable of maintaining those relationships\nremotely, which of course she could continue to do from abroad. Moreover, she has citizenship in\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool623", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l4 of l9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F.\nSupp. 3d 246, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“[T]he combination of Defendant’s alleged deceptive actions,\naccess to substantial financial resources, frequent international travel, complete lack of ties to the\nUnited States, and extensive ties to foreign countries without extradition demonstrates Defendant\nposes a serious risk of flight.”) (citing United States v. Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.) (denying bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> by defendant\nwith hypertension, stating that “[a]s serious as it is, the outbreak of COVID-l9 simply does not\noverride the statutory detention provisions [of the Bail Reform Act]” (internal quotation omited));\nUnited States v.

Apr. lo, 2o2o) (Ramos, J.)\n(“[B]ecause there is a pandemic does not mean that the jailhouse doors ought to be throun\nopen”)).

The MDC’s response to the pandemic was the subject of\nextensive evidentiary hearings in the context ofa civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York.\nSee Chunn v. Edge, No. 2o Cr. l59o, 2o2o WL 3o55669 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2o2o). In Chunn, the\nDistrict Court conducted extensive fact gathering about the conditions at the MDC before\nconcluding that “MDC officials have recognized COVID-l9 as a serious threat and responded\naggressively.” Jd. at *l; see also id. at 25 (“The MDC’s response to COVID-l9 has been\naggressive and has included, among other steps, massively restricting movement within the\nfacility, enhancing sanitation protocols, and creating quarantine and isolation units. And the data—\nthough limited—suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-l9\nthus far.’’).\n\nNumerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on assertions\nabout the hypothetical risks of COVID-l9, including multiple cases involving defendants who,\nunlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions. See, e.g., United States v. Hanes-\nCalugaru, No. l9 Cr. 65l, ECF No. 257 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2o2o) (Swain, J.)

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 3\nspeak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because\nthose victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in\nconnection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33-l Filed o7/28/2o Page l2 of l2\nDefense Counsel may make an appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the Court\nfor any such modifications.\nSO ORDERED:\nDated: New York, New York\n, 2o2o\nHONORABLE ALISON J.

Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool), while the Court ordered\nthe Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial,\nfollouing the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those\ncircumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District\nof New York opinion from 2oo9 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court\n' The Defense Leter states that the protective order was “entered” by the Court on July 3o, 2o2o.\nWhile that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on\nJuly 3l, 2o2o.\n> The Government’s most recent discovery transmital leter also included the months and years of\nbirth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether\nshe will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline\nfor any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page5of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The defendant\nidentifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that,\nas detailed belou, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery\nin this case.\n\nRegarding the defendant’s request in connection with access to discovery, the Government\nunderstands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s\nfirst discovery production at the time the Defense Leter was filed—she received the materials on\nTuesday, August ll. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week. Although this\narrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and\nis subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on\nan ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so.

(Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o.

The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial.

Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool732", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (holding that the need to “maintain\nthe secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain\nsentencing documents).\n\nFourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal\ndefendant should be permited to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2o2o WL l49588o, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page5of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery\nmaterials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 4 of5\n\n3.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review. Consistent with the Government’s\ncommitment to take a thorough and transparent approach to its disclosure obligations, this leter\noutlines the relevant investigative files of which the Government is currently aware and describes\nthe Government’s approach as to each.\n\nl. Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v.

In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files.

Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nWith regard to the November 25\" Leter, Ms. Maxwell requests redaction of three\nsentences. The first sentence must be redacted because it contains information that will identify\na proposed co-signer. The government, itself, concedes that such information should be\nredacted. (See November 25\" Leter at 3). The reference in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l\nF.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should\nweigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.... [C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

We are acutely mindful that courts are\ngenerally reluctant to seal anything in a court filing beyond what is required by statute or local\ncourt rules. We are therefore proposing targeted redactions, consistent with the case law in this\nCircuit, that are no more extensive than necessary to protect these third parties. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256\nF. Supp. 3d 355, 4ll (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\non privacy grounds). Ultimately, we seek the same privacy protections for these people that the\ngovernment has sought and obtained for Ms. Maxwell’s accusers and for other information\ncovered by the Protective Order in this case.\n\nBy making this request for redaction, we are not trying to litigate this case in secret. We\nare merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for Ms. Maxwell without further\nrisking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. This is the first of\nseveral confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will\nbe looking at the Court’s ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to\nbe afforded. These individuals have requested that their privacy and safety be appropriately\nprotected by the Court.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court file the proposed\nredacted version of the November 25\" Leter, atached as Exhibit A, and the proposed redacted\nversion of this leter, atached as Exhibit B. In the alternative, we request leave to withdraw both\nleters and refile the November 25™ Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool857", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page l of 4\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP l2l2 987 76oo phone\nwww.cohen gresser.com\n; USDCSDNY—t™\nMaks oe ” DOCUMENT\npape ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nmcohen@cohengresser.com aia pt, a\nceverdell@cohengresser.com DATE Ficep:_l2/7/2o___\nNovember 25, 2o2o\nTO BE FILED UNDER SEAL\nVIA EMAIL (SUBMITTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 2(B)\nOF JUDGE NATHAN’S INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES IN CRIMINAL CASES)\nThe Honorable Alison J.

They point to a sale of property in 2ol6.\nl3 According to the government, the property was sold for $l5\n\nl4 million. There is no secret about that. Those records are out\nl5 there. The government claims our client cleared $l4 million\n\nl6 from that in 2ol6 and apparently has it all today, which would\nl7 probably make it the first New York real estate transaction to\nl8 that effect. There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims. We\n2l think the number is far less than what the government asserts.\n22 But even taking that number, it's a number far louer than that\n23 in Khashoggi, far louer than that in Dreier, far louer than in\n24 many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,\n25 should be addressed by bail conditions.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool937", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 65 of 9l 65\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl litigation before your Honor about what is in the NPA, and the\n2 government, we expect, is going to take the position that\n\n3 unlike 'o7 is covered and nothing else.

Ghislaine is completely horrified and flabbergasted by these\nunfounded and completely horrendous accusations, as indeed am I.\n\nI feel totally safe around Ghislaine, in fact, I feel safer with her. I have never had any\nhesitation in my children visiting her or being with her — as they have been — both as young\nchildren and nou they are older. Neither they nor I have ever seen any signs or signals of the\nalleged criminal conduct. I personally witnessed her be a warm, lovely, understanding and\ncaring When visiting Ghislaine more recently as well as in\nthe past I was\nimpressed by her interaction with them and by their evident trust in and great affection for her\nwhich was entirely natural and unforced. Every exchange was totally normal and just lovely\nto watch hou each of these P| clearly liked P| and she them. Although\nGhislaine was certainly part of the New York social scene in the past, for many years, it had\nbecome clear to me that she was happy in a long-term loving relationship with her previous\npartner of over 7 years far away from the New York scene and with i\nleading a happy family life with people she loved and trusted and who were similarly equally\nloving and trusting of her. I saw the same patern of strong domesticity and family happiness\nwith her spouse a I have personally witnessed hou much they love\nbeing with and being loved by Ghislaine.\nIn terms of character, Ghislaine is compassionate, capable, and proactive. Ghislaine is very\nkind and caring, She brovch i l. siay with\nher in New York for extended periods so that they could spend quality time together.

They are an incredibly strong and close family unit.\nGhislaine has lived in the United States since the beginning of the l99os and has had to deal with\nfluctuating amounts of press interest in her life. This was notwithstanding her huge and understandable\nmistrust of the media which started with the fall-out from the sudden death of her Father and has\ncontinued to this day. Despite the tremendous ramping of press interest in her follouing the death of\nJeffrey Epstein in August 2ol9 Ghislaine remained living in the States. This was primarily so that she could\nbe with her family but also to ensure she was available to deal with any civil or even criminal allegations\narising from her past connection to Epstein should these arise.

Even my parents and children were harassed. JG hislaine’s house in\nLondon and today still there are journalists knocking on the door and filming the house. Ghislaine was\nterrified of being found by the press, or by deranged individuals and conspiracy theorists who threatened\nto harm her.

She had\nto isolate herself to protect her family and friends as much as herself. | spent a couple of days and nights\nwith her in October 2ol9 — we went for a walk and | directly experienced for myself the pressure and fear\nshe was living under. Any car or person that went by the house, or any unusual sounds she heard when we\nwere in the house, she thought the press or bounty hunters might have found her. She was genuinely\nterrified for her safety and this ended up making me feel terrified too.\nGhislaine has always met problems head on and has never been afraid of the truth. | have personally\nwitnessed this at many points in her life when she has had to pick herself up and rise to the challenge in\nfront of her.

In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*?

Athe bail hearing of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on l4 July 2o2o, the US Government made\n\nthe follouing point in support of its motion to detain the defendant:\n“The government has spoken with the Department of Justice ataches in the\nUnited Kingdom and France. With respect to France, we have been informed\nthat France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States.””.\n\n2. The international ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French nationality appear as one\nof the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\n“Ms Maxwell’s history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of\nflight. Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States. She holds multiple foreign citizenships, has familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant\nvalue. In particular, she is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to\nextradite its citizens”.\n\n3. The present report intends to evaluate whether the contention that France is a nation that\ndoes not extradite its citizens is correct as a mater of law.\n\n4. It will first set out the various steps of the French extradition procedure (Part I, and\nthen outline the grounds on which extradition requests are analyzed under French law,\nand especially the status of the rule against extradition of nationals, in order to assess the\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of these principles to an extradition request made by the USA, in particular\nwhere, as in this case, the requested person has executed an irrevocable waiver of his/her\nright to contest extradition and is present in France only because she fled the United\nStates in violation of her bail conditions.

Under Article l3.4 of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, if, within 6o\ndays of arrest, the government of the requested State has not received from the requesting\nState the formal extradition request as well as supporting documents required by the\nTreaty’, the requested person is discharged from custody.

Second stage: <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> for extradition (Ministerial phase)\n\nll. Article lo.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France provides that “all\nrequests for extradition shall be submited through the diplomatic channel”.\n\nl2. The Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not specify which internal\nprocedures must be folloued in each contracting State follouing the transmission of the\nextradition request through the diplomatic channel pursuant to Article lo. We must\ntherefore refer to provisions of the French Code of Criminal Procedure to outline the\nprocedure folloued by French institutions upon receipt of an extradition request made\nby the USA.\n\nl3. Under Article 696-9 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, the procedure folloued\nin France is as follous:\n\n7 Article lo of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 7\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 9 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n- The Minister of Foreign Affairs first verifies that the file is properly constituted in\naccordance with the requirements of the Extradition Treaty. The Minister of Foreign\nAffairs only verifies that the request contains all the required documents.\n\n- The file is then transmited to the Minister of Justice, which verifies the regularity\nof the request. At this stage, the French nationality of the requested person does not\ninfluence the control of the Minister of Justice.\n\n- The Minister of Justice must then forward the file to the Prosecutor General. This\nobligation to transmit the file to the Prosecutor General is binding, as Article 696-9\nuses imperative language requiring the Minister of Justice to do so.\n\nC. Third stage: Arrest and presentation before the Prosecutor General (beginning of\nthe judicial phase)\nl4. Any person arrested pursuant to an extradition <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> must be transferred to the\nterritorially competent Prosecutor General within 48 hours after the arrest®.\nl5. The Prosecutor General informs the requested person, in a language he or she\nunderstands, of:\n\n- the existence and the content of the extradition <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>;\n\n- the right to be assisted by an advocate and to have an interview with this advocate\nimmediately;\n\n- the right to consent to or to oppose his or her extradition, and the legal consequences\nof consenting to extradition;\n\n- the right to waive the principle of specialty (according to which the person who is\nextradited can be prosecuted only for the crimes specified in the extradition request),\nand the legal consequences of such renunciation.\n\nl6. The Prosecutor General hears the statements of the person and his or her counsel, and in\n\nparticular, the consent or opposition to extradition, which shall be officially recorded.\nl7. The Prosecutor General decides whether to release the requested person or not. If he\nconsiders that the requested person should remain in detention, the requested person then\nappears before the l President of the Court of appeal, who may order the person’s\nrelease (without any control, or with judicial supervision, or under house arrest with\nelectronic surveillance) or his/her incarceration.

In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically motivated.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the\nright to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane\n\n5 Cass. Crim., 26 March 2ol9, nNo. l9-8l73l.\nl6 Einhorn v.

If the Investigating Chamber\nfinds that the requested person would face a risk of being subject to violations of their\nArticle 3 rights, or that there is a risk of a “flagrant denial of justice” in the requesting\nState, it must deliver a negative opinion to the extradition request.\n\n37. In the recent years, human rights bars to an extradition request made by the United States\nof America are only the subject to in-depth scrutiny by French courts when the requested\nperson faces the imposition of the death penalty'® or the imposition of a life\nimprisonment sentence without the possibility of parole in the USA. We understand that\nthis is not the case here. It can be underlined that, when needed, the USA can commit\nnot to impose such a sentence and that such a commitment suffices to allou extradition.\n\n38. As long as the French government receives necessary assurances related to human rights\nwhen requested, such an argument would be very likely to be rejected in this case.\n\n(i) Dual criminality\n\n39. A further possible bar to extradition is the dual criminality rule, which requires the\nconduct in respect of which extradition is sought to constitute a criminal offense in the\nlaw of both requested and requesting States.\n\n4o. Article 2.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France expressly states that\n“fa]cts shall be extraditable if they are punished under the laws in both States by\ndeprivation of liberty for a maximum of at least one year or by a more severe penalty. If\nextradition is requested for purposes of enforcing a judgment, the time remaining to be\nserved must be at least six months.”\n\n4l. There is no doubt that the conduct referred to in the Grand Jury charges against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, contained in the Superseding Indictment Sl 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), filed\non July 8\", 2o2o, also constitutes criminal conduct under French law, as the crime of\n“proxenetisme’’.\n\n42. Article 225-5 of the French Criminal Code defines the crime of “proxenetisme” as “the\nfact, by anyone, in any manner whatsoever: l° To aid, assist or protect the prostitution\n\n” Soering v United Kingdom, o7/o7/l989, <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> No. l4o38/88; Cass.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn December l6, 2o2o, the Government filed its opposition to Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s renewed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail. In accordance with this Court’s December 7, 2o2o\nOrder, see Dkt. No. 89, the Government filed its materials under seal and proposed narrouly\ntailored redactions on those materials. The Defendant did not file any opposition to the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions.\nThe Court will adopt the Government’s proposed redactions after applying the three-part\ntest articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are\n“Judicial documents;” (ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the\nmaterials; and (ll) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at\nll9-2o. “Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd.\nat l2o (quoting United States v.

The Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l6 of 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 23 of 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 24 of 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 27 of 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo-2 Filed l2/l8/2o Page 2 of 4\n\nLarticle 3 du Traite bilateral d’extradition signe le 23 avril l996 entre les Etats-Unis\nd’Amerique et la France stipule que «/Evsat requis n'est pas tenu daccorder lextraition de l'un de ses\nressortassants, mais le Pouvoir extculif des Etats-Unis a la jaculte de ie faire, discretionnairement, sil le fuse\napproprie ».\n\nEn <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> de ce Traite et du ptincipe general de non-extradition des nationaux en dtoit\nfrancais, la France tefuse systematiquement d’accorder Pextradition de tessortissants francais aux\nautorites judiciaires americaines tandis que les autorites americaines acceptent reguherement d’extrader\nleurs ressortissants vers la France.\n\nIl convient de faire observer que le principe de non-extradition des nationaux vaut non\nseulement a l’egard des Etats-Unis mais egalement de tous les autres Etats a Pexception des Etats-\nmembres de l'Union europeenne, aux termes de la loi du 9 mars 2oo4 transposant la decision-cadre\ndu l3 juin 2oo2 sur le mandat d’arret europeen qui prevoit que la remise de la personne reclamee ne\npourra pas etre refusee au seul motif de sa nationalite francaise.\n\nCe temperament au principe de non-extradition des nationaux s’inscrit dans le contexte\npaticulier de la construction de espace judiciaire eutopeen qui s’inscrit lui-meme dans un processus\n@integration politique tres specifique entre les Etats-membres de Union europeenne.

On this renewed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks.

In any event, the new information provided in the renewed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\n\nonly solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2233", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2247", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2o of 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\ndiscovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.?\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

As discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, because the statements at issue are not perjurious, the\nquestions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed. None of the questions, or\nany answers, were material to any issue in the defamation action. There were no “crimes”\nconcealed by Ms. Maxwell’s answers which were both true and reflective of the poor\nquestioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate hou statements like:\n“T don’t knou what you are talking about,” an admission that Ms. Maxwell “could not make a\nlist” upon demand, her lack of knouledge about undefined “devices” or “toys” could possibly\n“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported connection between the Perjury\nCounts and the Mann Act Counts defies logic and is insufficient to permit joinder under Rule\n8(a). See Boti, 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the\nlink” between structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS agent and separate corruption\ncounts); Mitan, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3 (joinder improper where alleged perjury arose from\nfalse statement in connection with defendant’s bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, not an atempt to “cover up”\nunderlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).\n\nB. The Perjury Counts Should Be Severed Under Rule l4(a) Because Their\n\nInclusion Will Substantially Prejudice Ms. Maxwell at Trial\n\nEven if the Court finds that joinder is proper under Rule 8, the Court should nevertheless\nexercise its discretion to sever Counts Five and Six under Rule l4(a) because of the substantial\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and these proceedings. A joint trial of the Perjury Counts will require\na full-bloun re-litigation of the defamation action, which will result in a collateral mater taking\nover the trial. Substantial amounts of evidence that would be inadmissible and irrelevant as to\nthe Mann Act Counts will, necessarily, be presented in order to prove the Perjury Counts. For\nexample, there will need to be a collateral trial on whether Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s statements\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo229l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l5 of l9\njury would convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act Counts based on a false inference of criminal\npropensity. Similarly, it would create a substantial risk that the jury will confuse the legal and\nfactual issues pertinent to the Perjury Counts and convict Ms. Maxwell without independently\nconsidering those counts. See Ramos, 2oo9 WL l6l99l2, at *2 (severing “temporally distinct”\ndrug counts involving a different controlled substance from other drug counts because of “the\npotential for jury confusion, or improper propensity inferences, with respect to the drug-related\naspects of the original charges”).\n\nFurthermore, the government’s decision to allege violations only in the narrou l994-\nl997 time period was deliberate—it did so, in part, to try to avoid the impact of Epstein’s 2oo7\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”). In its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s initial bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the government argued that the NPA did not protect Ms. Maxwell from prosecution\nprincipally because the Indictment did not charge conduct covered by the NPA, which the\ngovernment argues “was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7, a time\nperiod that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 22 at 5-6).? The\ngovernment nou wants it both ways. It has confined the allegations in the Indictment to the\nearlier time frame to try to prevent a legal challenge that would result in the dismissal of the\nMann Act Counts, but at the same time it seeks to introduce conduct from the later time period\nby joining the Perjury Counts. The government should not be permited to do so.\n\nIn addition, joinder of the Perjury Counts would prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it could\nimpact the ability of Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice to participate in the criminal trial. The\nPerjury Counts will involve complicated legal issues about permissible deposition questions,\nwhether the answers to the poorly formulated questions would have been alloued, the role of a\n\n? The defense disputes that the coverage of the NPA is so limited.

The multifactor test, houever, remains applicable. See, e.g., United States v. Cooper, 886\nF3d. l46, l55 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8) (appellate court applied the Second Circuit multifactor test to two\nconspiracies charged in the same indictment and determined that the charges were multiplicitous,\nremanding the case to the district court with directions to vacate one of the convictions).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5of8\n\nIn many cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is lou.

Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y).

The Government’s False Statements To i\n\nOnly in August 2o2o, after she was indicted in this case, did Maxwell finally learn that\nthe government had obtained the J file by grand jury subpoena. Maxwell also\nlearned that, to overcome the strictures of the Protective Order, the government had instituted an\nex parte proceeding before ee (S.D.N.Y).

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 22\n\nMaxwell had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her EE because\nshe reasonably sought to preserve them as private.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the\nunderlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\nprosecutions for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the\nindictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of\nthe parties to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an\nevidentiary hearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nOn or about September 24, 2oo7, Epstein and his counsel entered into the NPA with\nAcosta, the United States Atorney for the SDFL.* While USAOs in a number of judicial\ndistricts, including this District, typically use a standard template for plea agreements and other\nnon-prosecution agreements, this NPA did not follou such a standard format. To the contrary,\n\n* A copy of the NPA is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 38\nmoved to dismiss a subsequent indictment in this District as barred by what they claimed was an\nearlier “plea agreement” in the Eastern District, and the court denied the motion. /d. The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 27 of 38\n\nHere, we understand that senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved in the\nnegotiation and approval of the NPA, and the NPA itself reflects the involvement of the FBI.\nNPA at l.

Kan. l976) (“if state law is silent and there is a\nconflict of authority in other jurisdictions, the federal court construing the law of the state will\nassume that the state court would follou the weight of authority”).\n\nHere, the weight of authority holds that, at least when a plea agreement refers to “the\nUnited States” or “the Government,” it binds USAOs in all districts absent a provision to the\ncontrary. See, e.g., United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 547-49 (3d Cir. 2oo2) (characterizing\nthe Second Circuit’s statement in Annabi as an “illogical posture” unsupported by the prior\nSecond Circuit cases on which it relied); United States v.

Harvey, 79l F.2d 294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986) (“It is the Government at large—not\njust specific United States Atorneys or United States ‘Districts’—that is bound by plea\nagreements negotiated by agents of Government.”).

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n: Julie K.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002650.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively. To the contrary, the conference commitee considered and rejected an express\nretroactivity provision in the House version of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-\nsponsors acknouledged on the Senate floor that the omission was intentional. Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2655", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002659.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 25\nthe law.” Bouen v. Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail to include an express\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2659", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of 25\nretroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a\nprovision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment not be retroactive. Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). Here, the\nlegislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,\nwhich would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity\nprovision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. llo4, lo8th Cong. § 2o2 (2oo3) (“The\namendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense commited\nbefore, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo266o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002663.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 25\nhad expressly prescribed that the 2oo3 Amendment would not be retroactive; Weingarten\nconsidered only whether there was an express prescription that the 2oo3 Amendment would be\nretroactive, concluding that the defendant’s counsel could have made “colorable” arguments that\nthere was no such prescription. Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the principle that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8), which the government cites in support of its contention that the 2oo3\nAmendment may be applied retroactively. Gov. Mem. at 6.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2663", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 25\n\nIn the civil context, the Second Circuit has acknouledged a distinction between\nretroactively applying an extended limitations period to revive a stale claim, which has been held\nimpermissible under Landgraf, and retroactively extending the limitations period for a live claim,\nwhich has been held permissible. See, e.g., Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(collecting and comparing civil cases). The criminal context, houever, is fundamentally\ndifferent.\n\nAta minimum, Toussie “potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach” in\ncriminal cases. United States v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 645 (lst Cir. 2ol8) (evaluating 2oo3\nAmendment in adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claim). “In other words, when\nCongress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from applying an enlarged\ncriminal statute of limitations retrospectively.” Jd. As shoun in the first step of Landgraf, the\ntrumpet sounded by Congress in enacting the 2oo3 Amendment was anything but uncertain:\ncongressional intent is clear.\n\nIn the criminal context, the retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of an extended statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim is not merely an impermissible effect under Landgraf; it violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3).* As Landgraf itself\nrecognized, houever, the principle against retroactivity is not simply an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; rather, it is a “deeply rooted” presumption based on “[e]lementary\nconsiderations” of fundamental “fairness.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 265-66. See also Thom v.\nAshcroft, 369 F.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., writing for the majority but noting\nhe was speaking for himself) (stating that anti-retroactivity presumption in Landgraf is “triggered\n+ For this reason, the government would be barred from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell for any offense against the third\naccuser (identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-3) even if the 2oo3 Amendment otherwise applied, because\nthe third accuser reached age 25 in a. and thus the statute of limitations as to her had expired by the time\nof the 2oo3 Amendment.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2664", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l6\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years” could be brought\nuntil the victim reached age 25. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged\n\nConspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause\none or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of\nthe conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3). As a non-citizen, Ms.\nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2733", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 3 of 9\ncitizens of those countries. The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2734", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 4 of 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2735", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 5of9\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to\nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense.\nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of\nwaivers of extradition. (See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account’”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6).

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted.

The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o.

For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

The key fact there, houever, was that the\ndefendants’ grand and petit juries were both drawn from White Plains, see id., which made it ,\nonly logical to conclude that the White Plains counties represented the relevant community.

Accordingly, this factual distinction precludes\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Johnson’s conclusion that the relevant community is “the district or division .\n\nwhere the trial is to be held.” See 2l F.

See, e.g., United States v. States v. Wey, 252 F.

(“It has been held, houever, that in limited\ncircumstances, both the government and a defendant may make an ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for a pre-\ntrial subpoena duces tecum” (emphasis added)). But see Ray, 2o2o WL 6939677 at *8 (“Courts\nin this District have long folloued the practice of permiting both the defense and the Government\nto submit ex parte applications for Rule l7(c) subpoenas.”); United States v.

Notice of Rule l7(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse\nand address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language\nof Rule l7: while Rule l7(b) expressly provides for an ex parte procedure for indigent defendants\nseeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for the\nproduction of documents and objects pursuant to Rule l7(c).4\n\n‘In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule l7(c) is simply an extension of Rules l7(a) and (b)’s\nprovisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice. See 2o2o WL 6939677, at\n*8 (quoting United States v. Florack, 838 F. Supp. 77, 79 (W.D.N.Y. l993)). Houever, Rule l7(c)\nsubpoenas for records are quite unlike subpoenas for trial testimony: they can be made returnable\nbefore trial, and Rule l7(c)’s text provides that materials obtained pursuant to such a subpoena\nmay be returnable to the Court, which may in turn “permit the parties and their atorneys to inspect\nall or part of them,” and subjects the subpoenas to motions to quash.

Indeed, the defendant has\nalready sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government’s interests\nby expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications\nwith the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears\nthat the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which\nplainly runs afoul of the Nixon test.

These procedures are,\nat a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding ex parte or under the rules that govern subpoenas\nfor trial testimony.\n> The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court’s\nMarch 24, 2o2l Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2o2l. To the extent the defendant did\nfile such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the\nGovernment is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF\nsubpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2897", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95_ Filed o4/o5/2l Pagellofll\nPage ll\nIV.

Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are\ntypically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery.

(internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, in this Circuit, District Courts regularly\naccept the Government’s proffer regarding its evidence when considering a bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. And\nhere, of course, the Court has not only the Government’s proffer but also the grand jury’s\ndetermination that probable cause exists as to each of the charged offenses. Defense counsel’s\nrequest to deviate from that ordinary practice appears to be a thinly veiled atempt at a fishing\nexpedition through which the defense hopes to obtain early Jencks Act material and a pretrial\nopportunity to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses, including victims of sexual abuse. It\nis to avoid such a fishing expedition, among other reasons, that courts in this Circuit proceed by\nproffer when considering bail motions. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir.\nl986) (“a detention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial . . . or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant”). The S2 Indictment offers no reason to deviate from that practice.\n%* %* %*\n\nFor the reasons above, the Government respectfully submits that trial can and should\nproceed as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe in-person arraignment on the S2 Indictment also serve as a conference at which to finalize a\nschedule for supplemental pretrial motion briefing as well as a schedule for trial-related\nsubmissions.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-oooo292o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 7 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, which presumes\na narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively\nestablish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”’) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 35 of 239\nprosecution . . . will be instituted in this District”). In other words, the NPA was expressly limited\nto the USAO-SDFL.? Given this provision, it would be unnatural to read a broader <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to\nother districts—based on no textual indicia—into the provision relating to co-conspirators.\nMoreover, the defendant’s reading of the NPA would require the Court to adopt the view that,\nwhere a plea agreement contains limiting terms, they must be repeated in every paragraph in order\nto have their natural and common-sense effects.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the defendant’s interpretation strains common sense.\nIn order to accept the defendant’s arguments, the Court would have to reach the counterintuitive\nconclusion that Epstein expressly bargained for broader immunity for his co-conspirators than he\ndid for himself. That is, under the defendant’s reading of the agreement, Epstein bargained to\nprotect co-conspirators nationally for crimes they commited with Epstein, but Epstein only sought\nprotection for himself in the Southern District of Florida. The text of the agreement does not\nsupport such a puzzling interpretation. Instead, the more natural reading of the NPA is that its\nrepeated references to the U.S. Atorney’s Office and “this District” reflect a universal limitation\non the NPA: it applies only to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nFinally, at several points in her motion, the defendant emphasizes that the NPA contains\nthe word “global,” but she does not appear to argue that this creates an affirmative appearance that\nthe NPA binds other districts. (Def. Mot. l at 9, l2). Nor could she. The phrase “Epstein seeks\nto resolve globally his state and federal liability,” by its terms, refers to Epstein’s liability alone.\nSee NPA at 2. Moreover, this language appears directly after several paragraphs describing\ninvestigations conducted by the Florida State Atorney’s Office and the USAO-SDFL. See id. at\nl-2. Thus, in this context, the terms “global” and “state and federal liability” plainly refer to\n> In fact, the NPA states that it was executed ‘on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United\nStates Atorney for the Southern District of Florida.” NPA at 2.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2969", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 239\nlimitations. As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea\nagreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. l at 3o (citing\nUnited States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (“[W]hile the district court’s analysis\nmight have been compelling with respect to a contract arising out of commercial negotiations\namong private parties, we believe the court did not correctly apply the standards that govern the\ninterpretation of plea agreements with the government. We have long recognized that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l3, l998) (“Even if Santobello could\nestablish the existence of plea agreements between the Government and his co-defendants, there\nis litle knoun authority that would allou him to enforce the agreements as a third party\nbeneficiary.”) (citing United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (lst Cir. l99l)).\n\nFollouing this logic, at least one court has concluded that third parties lack standing to\nenforce plea agreements. In United States v. Mariamma Viju, the defendant claimed that the\nGovernment had entered into a plea agreement with her husband, under which the Government\nhad promised not to prosecute her. No. l5 Cr. 24o, 2ol6 WL lo784l, at *l (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll,\n2ol6).

Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v.

In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred.

Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4).

(Def. Mem. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). The USAO-SDNY first contacted Boies Schiller about its\ninvestigation on or about December l8, 2ol8.

(See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at\nl-2). None of the documents apparently provided to AUSA-l during the February 2ol6 meeting\nwas an email.

Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN). Because\nof the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard\npractice under such circumstances, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel\nthat it had issued the subpoenas.\n\nIn response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not\ncovered by the protective orders in the relevant civil cases. Houever, Boies Schiller also had\nadvised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest compliance with the\nsubpoenas, it believed that the protective orders precluded full compliance.» (Exs. 8 & 9).\nAccordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet\nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective\nprotective orders to permit compliance with the subpoenas.

The Government wrote, “Where, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the\nrecipient of the subpoena is not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply\nwith the subpoena—a court should grant such permission through limited modification of an\napplicable protective order, absent countervailing interests not present in this case.” (/d. at 2).

In its leters, the Government noted that its “specific knouledge of the subject\nmater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential nature” of the litigation.\n(/d. at 2 n.l). The Government also submited that the court need not employ the Martindell\nbalancing test to evaluate the Government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a\nprotective order because (l) the Martindell balancing test generally relates to “instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without [ ] grand jury process” and (2) “any\npresumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where, as here, the\nprotective order is on its face temporary or limited.” (/d. at 3-4).\n\n6. Proceedings before Chief Judge McMahon\na. March 26, 2ol9 Hearing\nJudge Sweet passed away in March 2ol9 before ruling on the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>.\nAfter Judge Sweet’s death, but before the civil case was reassigned to a new judge, Chief Judge\nMcMahon took up the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Chief Judge McMahon subsequently inquired\nabout the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in two transcribed ex parte and sealed hearings. (Def. Mot.\n3, Exs. D & E). At the first hearing, on March 26, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon inquired as to\nwhy Boies Schiller did not make an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for permission to be relieved from the protective\norder, to which the Government replied that it could not “speak to why Boies Schiller in particular\ndidn’t make their oun <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 3). The Government further noted that\nBoies Schiller “simply isn’t in a position to be able to describe the investigation in the way that\nwe have in our submission.” (/d. at ll-l2). Chief Judge McMahon noted that she believed that\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003030.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 239\nMartindell was applicable. (/d. at 3). She stated that were the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> disclosed\nto the parties, “Maxwell would protest” and argue that the Government lacked standing as it was\nnot a party to the protective order. (/d. at 8). In response to questions from Chief Judge McMahon,\nthe Government explained that the protective order, on its face, did not implicate the types of\nconfidential business information or trade secrets ordinarily considered by courts in conducting\nthe Martindell balancing test. (/d. at l3).\n\nChief Judge McMahon stated that the protective order did not contain a provision allouing\na party to the order to disclose materials requested by law enforcement without permission of the\ncourt, noting her understanding that “it may have been negotiated out.” (/d. at l4-l5). The court\ninquired whether the Government’s position was that “reliance on the nondisclosure of\nconfidential materials to law enforcement in connection with a grand jury subpoena that has been\nduly authorized would be unreasonable.” (/d. at l4). The Government responded in the\naffirmative, stating that the Government believed a provision precluding compliance with a law\nenforcement request would be void for public policy. (Ud. at l5). The Government further cited\nChemical Bank in support of the proposition that it would be unreasonable to rely on a protective\norder provision that barred the disclosure of information to law enforcement. (/d. at l5-l6).\n\nIn response to questions about the breadth of the subpoena, the Government explained that\nit was “essentially unable to significantly narrou the request for information ... . We have either\nlitle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are [and]\nwho was deposed.” (/d. at l7). In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the protective order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003031.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 239\nof the materials in light of the “extraordinary protections” of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedue\n6(e). Ud. at l7-l8).\n\nFinally, Chief Judge McMahon also inquired whether the materials sought by the\nGovernment might be used to commence criminal proceedings against either of the parties to the\nlibel case, i.e., including Maxwell. (/d. at l8). The Government acknouledged that possibility as\na general mater. (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon noted that the parties to the protective order relied\non that order “in order to give whatever in discovery they gave, whether it was deposition\ntestimony they gave or — then again, I can’t fathom why anybody who has any criminal exposure\nwould not have taken the Fifth Amendment in response to questions in a civil deposition, but I\ndon’t knou.” (/d. at l8-l9). The Government stated, “I do not knou, but I think it is entirely\npossible that what we are seeking is page after page of people taking the Fifth. That is entirely\npossible. But to the extent that it is not or there are other materials -- and this may be bad for our\nargument, but in all transparency and candor, I think there may be other individuals who also relied\non the protective order.” (/d.). The Government further explained that it “want[ed] to have a\nformal <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>” for the relevant materials and took that approach to “avoid the types of\nproblems” created by other less formal government requests in other cited cases. (/d. at 2o).\n\nb. April 9, 2ol9 Hearing\n\nChief Judge McMahon held another conference on April 9, 2ol9. She stated that she\nwanted “to make sure I’m not in a Chemical Bank kind of situation, so I would like to knou about\ncontacts between [the USAO-SDNY and Boies Schiller] prior to the issuance of the subpoena on\nthe subject of your investigation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added)).*4 In Chemical\n4 Tellingly, Maxwell omits the italicized portion of this question from her motion, thereby\nstripping important context from the nature of Chief Judge McMahon’s question which, as asked,\nwas focused on “your investigation.” (See Def. Mot. 3 at 7).\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o3l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003032.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 239\nBank, of course, as noted above, the subpoena recipient produced materials to a prosecutor in\ndirect violation of the relevant protective order, without seeking a modification of the protective\norder and without any court authorization to do so. l54 F.R.D. at 93. Moreover, in that case, the\nDistrict Atorney seemingly opened its investigation and issued the subpoena in direct response to\ninformation provided by the subpoena recipient who was then a party to civil litigation. /d.\n\nThe Government responded to Chief Judge McMahon by explaining its contacts with Boies\nSchiller in connection with the instant (and only) investigation it had opened on Epstein, that is,\nthe investigation prompted by, and opened follouing, public reporting on Epstein in November\n2ol8. In particular, the Government explained that the USAO-SDNY opened an investigation\nfirst, on either November 3o, 2ol8 or December 3, 2ol8, and then made contact with Boies Schiller\nshortly thereafter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). In this respect, the Government further explained\nthat the USAO-SDNY, after opening the investigation, had endeavored to identify counsel who\nrepresented victims or witnesses in public filings or media reports, which included Boies Schiller,\nnoting that “[w]ith respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during the\ninvestigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil litigation” and\nindicated that the USAO-SDNY intended to make document requests. (/d.). The Government\nalso noted that, unlike in Chemical Bank, here Boies Schiller had informed the Government that it\nwould be unable to comply with the subpoena in light of the protective order. (/d. (noting that\nBoies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there was a protective order that would\ngovern at least some of the materials, and that is why we ultimately made the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the\nCourt.”)).\n\nCc. Chief Judge McMahon’s Memorandum and Order\n7l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 239\n\nOn or about April 9, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon granted the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nand issued a memorandum and order. (Def. Mot. 3, Exs. F & G). The Court noted that while the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was procedurally “[i]rregular,” there was precedent for granting the\nGovernment’s request and, therefore, the Court would consider the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.\nG at 6, 8-9). The Court found that, contrary to the Government’s arguments, it was appropriate\nfor the Court to analyze the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in light of the Martindell factors. (/d. at 9-\nl2).\n\nIn so doing, Chief Judge McMahon considered, among other things, “the degree to which\n. . . the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing[] reasonably relied on the protective\norder.” (/d. at l6). She concluded that such reliance was unreasonable. (/d. at 22). She evaluated\nthe factors under Second Circuit case law that are relevant to assessing whether a party’s reliance\non the protective order was reasonable, namely the scope of the protective order, the language of\nthe order itself, the court’s level of inquiry before granting the order, and the nature of reliance on\nthe order. (/d. at l7). She concluded that first three factors favored granting the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for modification. (/d. at l7-2o). Chief Judge McMahon noted that, as the order\n“plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure to anyone—law\nenforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic\npermission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s\nscrutiny.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\nAs to the last factor, Chief Judge McMahon found that “the nature of the parties’ reliance\non the order does seem to weigh against modification.” (/d. at 2o). She noted that the record\nindicated that “Giuffre likely could not have secured Maxwell’s deposition—at least in the absence\nof substantial court involvement—without” the protective order. (/d.). “Houever, the only thing\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 239\n\non which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is that Giuffre or her lawyers would\nnot do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, forward discovery materials in their\npossession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 239\nprovided to Boies Schiller shortly after it was issued.

Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN),\nof Chief Judge McMahon’s decision via ex parte and sealed leter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.

Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the\nprotective order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional\ncircumstances or a compelling need. (/d. at 3). She concluded that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the protective order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and\n“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn concluded that “the\nGovernment must demonstrate not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that\nthe reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to\nmodify the Protective Order. The Government has not met that standard.” (/d. at 7) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n8. Unsealing of Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nThree months after Chief Judge McMahon issued her Order, Giuffre v. Maxwell was\nreassigned to the Honorable Loreta A. Preska on July 9, 2ol9. On or about July 23, 2o2o, Judge\nPreska ordered unsealed certain litigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell’s April\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 239\ncommited perjury.” According to two anonymous sources, “a second meeting occurred.”\nHouever, the Article cites another anonymous source as “insist[ing] [a second meeting] never\nhappened.”\n\nB. The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\nAmendment, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the protective order to permit compliance with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> under Martindell, properly exercised her discretion\nin modifying the protective order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) protective order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 239\nsupervision of a judge, the longstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s\nevidence,’ except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory\nprivilege is particularly applicable to grand jury proceedings.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’!

Mar. 2, 2olo) (finding that the parties’ reliance on a\ncivil protective order “was not unreasonable given the nature of the litigation,” but “not so\noverwhelming as to warrant the indefinite <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Martindell’s strong presumption against\nmodification because the order’s broad scope and express language, and the minimal level of court\ninquiry outweigh the Parties’ reliance.”).\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 239\npublic interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious\ncrime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 239\nway circumvented Martindell; rather, the Government sought court approval to enforce a subpoena\nand then folloued the directives it received.*”\n\nMost critically, houever, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell,\nMaxwell offers no legal authority for the proposition that suppression is the proper remedy.*®\nIndeed, none of the Second Circuit cases applying Martindell contemplate suppression as a\nremedy. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional circumstances or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of protective orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\ndiscretion in modifying the protective order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\nprotective order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a protective order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s invitation to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\nprotective order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a protective order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other\nindividuals’ depositions, who were not parties to the protective order.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 239\ni. Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 239\nestablish that a law enforcement officer has acted in good faith in conducting the search.” J/d.\n(internal quotation marks and citations omited); see also Golino v. City of New Haven, 95o F.2d\n864, 87o (2d Cir. l99l) (noting that the “issuance of a warrant by a neutral magistrate, which\ndepends on a finding of probable cause, creates a presumption that it was objectively reasonable\nfor the officers to believe that there was probable cause”). Indeed, the good faith exception does\nnot apply only in four narrou circumstances:\n\n(l) where the issuing magistrate has been knouingly misled; (2)\nwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial\nrole; (3) where the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> is so lacking in indicia of probable\ncause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the\nwarrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nUnited States v. Moore, 968 F.2d 2l6, 222 (2d Cir. l992) (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 923). The good\nfaith exception analysis applies in the context of court orders. See, e.g., Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at\nl43 (applying good faith analysis in Fourth Amendment challenge to cell phone location\ninformation obtained by subpoena issued pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 27o3(c)(2)); United States v.\nSerrano, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol4 WL 2696569, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. June lo, 2ol4) (finding good\nfaith exception would apply to cell site information obtained pursuant to a subpoena authorized by\nmagistrate judge pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 27o3(d)); United States v.

Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2).\n\nIn Chemical Bank, counsel for a civil party approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s\nOffice “suggesting that it had evidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” l54 F.R.D. at\n93. In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2o of 239\nconsidered the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and then issued a lengthy opinion ruling on that\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Government was entirely reasonable in its understanding that the order was lawful.\nIt was therefore similarly reasonable for the Government to obtain materials from Boies Schiller\nin response to the subpoena that had been analyzed and blessed by a court order. The Government\nacted with an “objectively reasonable good-faith belief’ that its conduct was lawful and in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s order. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at l43 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omited).\n\nc. Suppression of Certain Materials Would Be Improper Under\nthe Inevitable Discovery Doctrine\nTo the extent materials the Government obtained from Boies Schiller have nou been\nunsealed and posted on the public docket, there is no basis to suppress such materials because the\nGovernment would have inevitably been able to access them upon unsealing.\ni. Applicable Law\nUnder the inevitable discovery doctrine, “evidence that was illegally obtained will not be\nsuppressed ‘if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably’\neven if there had been no statutory or constitutional violation.” United States v. Roberts, 852 F.2d\n67l, 675-76 (2d Cir. l988) (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 43l, 447 (l984)). When a claim of\ninevitable discovery is raised, the court must “determine, viewing affairs as they existed at the\ninstant before the unlawful search occurred, what would have happened had the unlawful search\nnever occurred.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citation omited) (emphasis in original); see also United\nStates v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (The <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine “turns on a central question: Would the disputed evidence inevitably have been found\nthrough legal means ‘but for’ the constitutional violation? If the answer is ‘yes,’ the evidence\nseized will not be excluded.”).\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 239\nb. Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In Valentine, the\ndefendant was convicted of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o. The Second Circuit reversed\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 239\n\nThe law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority does not extend to suppressing\nevidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.\nat 737 (holding that “the supervisory pouer does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered\nlimitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976\n(2d Cir. 2ol4) (same); United States v. Jennings, 96o F.2d l488, l49l (9th Cir. l992) (“Absent a\nviolation of a recognized right under the Constitution, a statute, or a procedural rule, a district court\nis not entitled to exclude evidence as a sanction against government practices disapproved of by\nthe court.”). The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that principle, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 4ol-o2 (“We can\nappreciate the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact\nthe integrity of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an\nadversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing\nevidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise\nits supervisory pouers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth\nAmendment right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot\nbe described as a recognized right.” (internal citations omited)).\n\n6. The Defendant Is Not Entitled to a Hearing\n\nThe defendant argues that if the Court is “disinclined” to grant the extraordinary relief of\n\nsuppression she seeks, she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to probe the Government’s\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 239\nF.2d at 929). Offenses may be joined “where the same evidence may be used to prove each count\nor if the counts have a sufficient logical connection.” United States v. Page, 657 F.3d l26, l29\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). “For purposes of analysis under\nRule 8(a),” houever, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish ‘similarity’ of offenses,\nand each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v. Blakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d\nCir. l99l) (internal quotations and citations omited). For instance, in United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o), the “Second Circuit found sufficient similarity between two cargo\nthefts that occurred two years apart and only one of which was violent in nature,” because “both\noffenses arose out of [defendant’s] scheme to use his position as an insider . . . to obtain money or\nproperty carried by it.’” United States v. Smith, No. o5 Cr. 922 (DLC), 2oo7 WL 98o43l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2oo7), aff'd, 348 F. App’x 636, 638 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (first alteration in original)\n(quoting Werner, 62o F2d at 927).\n\nJoinder is also proper for “distinct criminal acts where they originated from a common\nscheme.” United States v. Ying Lin, No. l5 Cr. 6ol (DLI), 2ol8 WL 5ll3l39, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. l9, 2ol8) (citing Werner, 62o F.2d at 927). Specifically in the context of perjury, “[t]he law\nin this circuit clearly supports the joinder of underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts\nwhere, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.” United States v. Potamitis,\n739 F.2d 784, 79l (2d Cir. l984); see United States v. Sweig, 44l F.2d ll4, ll8 (2d Cir. l97l).\nFalse statements can “concern” or be connected with substantive offenses even if they were not\nmade as part of an investigation into the specific substantive conduct. See United States v.

It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his possession of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “sufficient logical connection” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.

Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein.

The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4o of 348\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”?

According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®!

According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 5 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—trelied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide protection against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebuted\nand the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.\n\n* An <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of\nwitnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in\nthe course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo85l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3548", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot. Order at 2\n(designating as “confidential” only information that is “confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of” the plaintiff and defendant”). “Aside from those restrictions\n[laid doun by the Fourth or Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes], hiding possible criminal\nviolations from law enforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\nconfidentiality.” Chemical Bank, l5 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nFinally, this is unlike a case in which the contours of the civil litigation are publicly\napparent. Cf Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the\nbankruptcy examination in that case “was made available to the public”). In Subpoena Duces\nTecum, for example, not only was the government apparently unconcerned with the confidentiality\nof the grand jury investigation, but the government knew from a lengthy public report precisely\nwhat it might replicate through a grand jury investigation. /d. Not so with respect to the Litigation,\nwhich resulted in no such report, no trial, and limited public filings.\n\nFor all of these reasons, and for the reasons set forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court grant the <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nGEQ@FFREY S.

The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—relied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide protection against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebuted\nand the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.\n\n* An <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of\nwitnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in\nthe course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo923\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3554", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”).

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary.

Opp. 27. Under Landgraf, the first step is\n“to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach”; if it has,\nthere is no need to proceed further. 55l U.S. at 28o. Ifit has not, the court must determine\n“whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties\nwith respect to transactions already completed.” Jd.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3659", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page8of 22\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s opening memorandum (“Mem.”) has demonstrated, proper <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nof Landgraf prohibits retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment. Congressional intent\ncould not be clearer; Congress considered and expressly rejected a provision that would have\nmade the 2oo3 Amendment retroactive. That ends the Landgraf inquiry at step one. Even if the\ninquiry proceeds to step two, houever, the government has failed to adequately rebut Ms.\nMaxwell’s shouing that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment here would have impermissible\nretroactive effects.\n\nA. Step One: Congress Did Not Expressly Prescribe Retroactivity and Rejected\n\na Proposal to Do So.\nl. Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision ends the\ninquiry at step one in Ms. Maxwell’s favor.\n\n“TW |here the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (l99o)). As Ms.\nMaxwell’s opening memorandum demonstrated, congressional intent with respect to the\nretroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment is clear: the House version of the bill included\nan express retroactivity provision, the Senate version contained no retroactivity provision, and, in\nthe words of one of the bill’s co-sponsors, the House-Senate conference “agreed to drop\nlanguage from the original House-passed bill that would have extended the limitations period\nretroactively.” Senator Leahy, Amber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3). The Court\nneed look no further. Such an unambiguous expression of congressional intent establishes\nconclusively that the 2oo3 Amendment is not retroactive.\n\nThe government argues that Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision is not\nprobative, because according to Senator Leahy’s floor statement, the decision was grounded in\nconcerms about the revival of time-barred charges rather than the extension of live charges, and at\nleast some of the charges here were live at the time of the 2oo3 Amendment. But to the extent\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 22\n\nIt will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that\n\nretroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.\n\nThat consideration, houever, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against\n\nretroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursue a single goal, and\n\ncompromises necessary to their enactment may require adopting means\n\nother than those that would most effectively pursue the main goal.\n\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 285-86 (emphasis added). Thus, it is not anomalous at all that Congress\nwould “exempt[] all past offenders” from the new limitations period, as the government asserts\n(Opp. 3l); to the contrary, the law presumes that past conduct is exempt from legislation. Here,\nCongress’ clear intent that the 2oo3 Amendment not be retroactive resolves the Landgraf inquiry\nin Ms. Maxwell’s favor at step one.\nDe Cases applying the 2oo3 Amendment retroactively are readily\ndistinguishable.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases that have applied the 2oo3 Amendment\nretroactively (Opp. 26-27), most of those cases analyzed the issue under the Ex Post Facto\nClause and gave litle, if any, consideration to congressional intent regarding retroactivity (as\nopposed to the intent of the amendment itself). In all but one of those cases, no Landgraf\nanalysis was performed, and it does not appear that Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity\nprovision was considered or even raised.’ But the government does not dispute that Landgraf is\nthe appropriate framework—nor can it, given the Second Circuit’s acknouledgment that the\nretroactivity of the 2oo3 Amendment must be analyzed under Landgraf. Weingarten v. United\nStates, 865 F.3d 48, 54-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\n* No Landgraf analysis was performed, nor was Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision discussed, in\nUnited States v.

Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9 (E.D. Va. 2ol9). In\nNader, the court performed a Landgraf analysis in analyzing the retroactivity of the 2oo3\nAmendment, and it appears to be the only previous case in which Congress’ explicit rejection of\na retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment has even been mentioned. In Nader, houever,\nthe court noted the legislative history of the 2oo3 Amendment but held that only the ‘ext of the\namendment was relevant to step one of Landgraf. 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627 (finding legislative\nhistory arguments “misplaced within the first step of the Landgraf analysis, which asks only\nwhether the statute at issue contains ... language unequivocally delineating the time period to\nwhich it applies”).\n\nNader’s exclusion of legislative history from the Landgraf analysis‘ cannot be reconciled\nwith the Supreme Court’s applications of Landgraf—or, for that mater, with Landgraf itself.\nSee, e.g., Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264 (considering legislative history); Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S.\n343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history” as part of first Landgraf step).\nAnd as the government acknouledges, “the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the\nstatute and the legislative history” at the first Landgraf step. Opp. 28 (citing Jn re Enterprise\nMortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol, 4o6-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo4)). Thus, Nader is not persuasive\nauthority.\n\nIn short, no court has considered Congress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision\nin performing a Landgraf analysis of the retroactivity of the 2oo3 Amendment. In fact, the\ngovernment cites only three cases that have analyzed the 2oo3 Amendment under Landgraf at\nall: the Second Circuit and First Circuit opinions in Weingarten and United States v. Miller, 9ll\nF.3d 638 (lst Cir. 2ol8), respectively, which were ineffective assistance of counsel cases and\n* Although the court in Nader explicitly characterized legislative history arguments as “misplaced” within step one\nof Landgraf, it also omited them from step two of its Landgraf analysis.

In l99o, “the only existing limitations period to which the\nlanguage could have referred was the [five-year] default limit set forth in [l8 U.S.C. § 3282].”\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 644. That is the logical reading of the same provision here.\n\nThe government cannot prevail on step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. Maxwell’s\nfavor, the inquiry must proceed to step two.\n\nB. Step Two: <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s Alleged\n\nOffenses Would Have Impermissible Effects.\n\nEven if the Landgraf inquiry were to proceed to the second step—whether retroactive\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> would have impermissible effects—Ms. Maxwell should prevail. In arguing\notherwise, the government effectively claims that in the retroactivity context, Landgraf permits\nthe Court to ignore the bedrock principle that “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally\ninterpreted in favor of repose.’” TYoussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting\nUnited States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 5l8, 522 (l932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a civil case,\npurports to limit that principle, let alone abrogate it.\n\nThe government asserts that no court has held that retroactively extending a filing period\nfor live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf (Opp. 35),\nbut that is not so. In United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J. 2ol7), the court held\nthat it would be impermissible to retroactively extend a statute of limitations for live charges\n“absent clear legislative intent” to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Jd. at 655. In\ndoing so, the court read Landgraf in conjunction not only with Toussie but also with Hughes\nAircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 52o U.S. 939 (l997), a post-Landgraf opinion in which the\nSupreme Court reiterated the law’s presumption against retroactivity and reiterated that “we\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 22\napply this time-honored presumption unless Congress has clearly manifested its intent to the\ncontrary.” Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 654 (quoting Hughes, 52o U.S. at 946 (emphasis added\nby court)).° The First Circuit, addressing the issue on an ineffective assistance of counsel of\nclaim (and thus not reaching a merits decision), issued a similar caution in the specific context of\nthe 2oo3 Amendment:\n\n[W]hen Congress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from\n\napplying an enlarged criminal statute of limitations retrospectively. ... Seen in\n\nthis light, Toussie potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach.\n\nMiller, 9ll F.3d at 645.°\n\nBy contrast, the government cites only one case—Nader—in which a court has held that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct is permissible under\nthe second step of Landgraf. Like the government here, houever, the court in Nader offered no\npath to reconciling Landgraf with Toussie. Instead, it applied Landgraf, a civil case, in a manner\nthat interprets Toussie out of existence in the retroactivity context, without any suggestion from\nthe Supreme Court that it intended such an effect. The opinions in Miller and Gentile, in\nacknouledging the need to read Landgraf and Toussie in harmony, provide the correct legal\nframework for the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the second step of Landgraf. This is particularly so in light of\nCongress’ explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2oo3 Amendment, a factor not\nconsidered in Miller and absent from Gentile.\n\nIn arguing that “Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions” (Opp. 34) (emphasis added), the government completely misses the point.

See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 34\nTo the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is\ninappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes that call for <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\n\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54.

For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003690.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the\nprimary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’” United States v.

Any number of\n\nstraightforward follou-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry.

See Razzaia, 37o F.Supp. at 578-79. Left naked, the government's imprecise\n\nquestion did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with\n\na sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering\n\nas he did. Jd. at 579.

The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4.

Resp. l4l. “Similar character,” for purposes of F.R.E. 8(a)\n“means nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects or having a general likeness.” United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o). The alleged perjury in an unrelated defamation\ncase more than 2o years after the fact bears no likeness to allegedly enticing someone to travel\nfor an illegal sexual purpose.\n\nB. The Perjury Charges Do Not “Concern” the Mann Act Offenses.\n\nNor do the Perjury Counts “concern” the Mann Act Counts as claimed by the\ngovernment. Resp. l43. The government cites the supposedly “setled law in this Circuit that\njoinder of ‘underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts’ is appropriate ‘where . . . the false\ndeclarations concern the substantive offenses.”” Jd. (citing United States v. Potamitis, 739 F.2d\n784, 79l (2d Cir. l984)). But it is wrong on both the facts and the law.\n\nThe cases cited by the government involve a distinct fact patern: the defendant allegedly\nmade a materially false statement that relates directly to the underlying crime and the crime is\ntemporally related to the false statement. The Potamitis case that the government relies upon\nprimarily for this proposition is a good example. In that case, the defendant was charged with\nmaking false statements to FBI agents, commiting perjury before the grand jury, and obstruction\nof justice because he lied to the FBI agents and the Grand Jury about the underlying crimes for\nwhich he was being investigated and questioned.

First, BSF admits that these communications occurred. Second, the\ncommunications about trying to get Ms. Maxwell indicted were “prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation or for trial,” admiting both relevance and admissibility. BSF does not and cannot\nplausibly explain hou a joint effort to procure a civil opponent’s indictment is protected by the\nwork product doctrine. BSF’s ipse dixit fails because the\n\n“burden of justifying the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the work product doctrine is on the asserting\n\nparty, and the burden is a heavy one because privileges are neither lightly created\n\nnor expansively construed.

This is precisely the\npurpose of Nixon’s specificity requirement—to ensure that Rule l7 subpoenas are narrouly\ntailored to obtain only relevant and admissible evidence, not to obtain discovery in the hopes that\nsomething relevant and admissible might turn up, and to allou the recipient to lodge relevance and\nadmissibility objections as to the precise documents being requested.

See United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698-99\n(l974) (citing Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l)).

As a result, courts must be mindful not to allou the Rule l7(c) process to become a\n“broad discovery device” that would undermine the discovery procedures set forth in Rule l6.\nUnited States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995). Thus, if an item is not\ndiscoverable under Rule l6, a party cannot make it discoverable simply by subpoenaing it under\nRule l7. United States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4-CR-l86 (SCR), 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nA. The BSF Subpoena\n\nThe proposed subpoena makes twelve requests.

On the specificity prong alone, Requests | through 5 fail to satisfy\nthe Nixon standard.\n\nRequests l and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials\nsought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests l, 2, and 8 all seek documents\nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests l and 2 seek\ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2ol5\nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that\nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government’s failure to comply with its\ndiscovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be\notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the\nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government\nhas not met its discovery obligations, the Rule l7(c) subpoena process is not the proper\nmechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly\njoined, Maxwell must make some shouing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief\nfrom this Court.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF\nand two of its clients who are alleged victims.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nWe write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to\naccept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in\nthis case for Ms. Maxwell’s use at the MDC.\nIn an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell’s review of the discovery, defense counsel have\ncreated a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by\nthe government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is\nnot permited to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master\ndrives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one\nplace and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November l8,\n2o2o production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which\ncontains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and\nother formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and\neliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her\nreview.\nDefense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the\nMDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permited to accept\nhard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Atorney’s Office. We have conferred with\nthe government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to\nthe Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government\nrequested, houever, that the Court allou MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their\nobjections to the Court.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 265 Filed o5/o3/2l Page2of3\ncounsel’s current <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> is that this Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of\nthe in-person atorney-client visit.

Houever, the\nCourt highlighted the apparent anomaly of this rule, noting that an agreement with “the\nGovernment” to dismiss counts of an indictment “might be thought to bar the United States from\nreprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the agreement expressly limits\nthe scope of the agreement to the district in which the dismissed charges are initially brought.”\nId. The Court further explained that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the “affirmative appearance” rule was\nnevertheless appropriate because it had not been presented with a situation where the counts in\nthe second prosecution were identical to the dismissed counts. /d. Although the defendants had\nargued that the charges in Counts One and Three of the SDNY indictment “result[ed] from the\nsame conspiratorial agreement” as the dismissed counts in the EDNY indictment, the Court\nfound that the SDNY charges covered conduct “extending more than two years beyond the date\nof the period covered by the dismissed charges,” are were therefore “not the same as the charges\nthat were dismissed.” /d.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l34 of 349\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4l of 349\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l42 of 349\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?!

Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 26\nIndictment before determining whether the plain-statement rule of Annabi applies. Annabi, the\ndefendant suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between newly\ncharged offenses and earlier plea agreements: if the offense is not covered by the plea agreement,\nthe agreement is irrelevant; if the offense is covered by the agreement but different! from a count\n“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Annabi rule applies; and if the offense is identical\nto a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent.

Instead, the language the defendant points to in\nAnnabi simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish precedent. Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itself, those cases evaluate the text and history of plea\nagreements to determine the scope of the immunity provided by those agreements, including by\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the affirmative appearance rule.

The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 26\nfailure to honor a plea agreement.” United States v.

And, as described above, the NPA presents no\nbarrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six should be denied.\n\nIl. Counts Five and Six Are Timely\n\nCounts Five and Six are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse . . .\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and the victim identified in Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment remains alive. The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “essential ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later prosecuted the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l6 of 26\nquestion is simply “whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts\nalleged in this case.” (Apr. Op. at l3). As was the case for Counts One through Four, there is no\nquestion that Counts Five and Six involved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts alleged in this\ncase. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nCounts Five and Six are also timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3299, which eliminated the statute\nof limitation for certain sex crimes, including violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Enacted in July\n2oo6, § 3299 provides that:\n\nNotwithstanding any other law, an indictment may be found or an\n\ninformation instituted at any time without limitation for any offense\n\nunder section l2ol involving a minor victim, and for any felony\n\nunder chapter lo9A, llo (except for section 2257 and 2257A), or\n\nll7, or section l59l.\nBecause Count Five alleges a conspiracy to violate § l59l and Count Six alleges a substantive\nviolation of § l59l, there is no statute of limitation for these counts, pursuant to § 3299,\n\nApplying § 3299, which was passed in 2oo6, to charges arising from conduct between 2ool\nand 2oo4 is appropriate under Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994). At step\none of the Landgraf analysis, the statute unambiguously applies to offenses notwithstanding any\nother statute of limitations, as the plain text of § 3299 applies “[n]otwithstanding any other law.”\nAnd at step two, because the statute of limitations for Counts Five and Six had not run in 2oo6\nwhen § 3299 was passed, its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> here has no impermissible retroactive effect. Indeed, in\nmany respects the analysis of § 3299 under Landgraf mirrors the analysis of § 3283, which the\nCourt has held applies to pre-enactment conduct. (See Apr. Op. at l6 (analyzing the retroactive\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of § 3283 and concluding that the statute applies to pre-enactment conduct)).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4723", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 _ Filed o6/o4/2l Page3of6\nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she\ntook with Epstein.

It further held that a\ncourt should modify a protective order that a party reasonably relied on only if the order had\nbeen improvidently granted or upon a shouing of extraordinary circumstances or compelling\nneed.\n\nJudge McMahon held a second ex parte hearing on April 9, 2ol9. At that hearing, citing\na district court case called Chemical Bank for the proposition that civil litigants ought not foment\ncriminal investigations against their opponents to gain strategic advantage, she asked the\nGovernment about contacts between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF on the subject of the\nGovernment’s investigation. The Government explained that BSF had informed the Government\nthat some of the documents the Government sought were covered by a protective order. The\nGovernment did not mention any of the communications with BSF atorneys in 2ol6.\n\nJudge McMahon issued a sealed order granting the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> folloued\nby a sealed opinion dated April 9, 2ol9. In the opinion, she explained that Martindell governed\nthe Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, but that two of the Martindell factors supported modification of\nthe protective order. First, Maxwell did not reasonably rely on the protective order because it\nwas subject to modification. Second, the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances\nsupporting modification of the protective order because it could not otherwise obtain information\nabout the high-profile targets of its investigation without tipping them off. Magistrate Judge\nNetburn denied the Government’s similar <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in another case, applying the same\nstandard but concluding that the Government had not shoun extraordinary circumstances or\ncompelling need.\n\nFollouing Judge McMahon’s order, BSF turned over its records from the civil litigation\nto the Government. Those documents included transcripts of Maxwell’s depositions. The\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel5of2l\n\nAlthough Maxwell relied on Franks in her opening brief, she argues in reply that she\nneed not satisfy that standard. See Dkt. No. l34, at l6; Dkt. No. 285, at 23. Houever, she\nprovides no explanation for why Franks should not apply. To the extent she offers any\nalternative framework in her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever any\nfactual issue related to a motion to suppress is in dispute. That formulation is far too broad.\n\nThe Court agrees with the Government (and the suggestion in Maxwell’s opening brief)\nthat Franks provides the appropriate standard for whether Maxwell is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on her motion. To be sure, these cases are not identical. Franks dealt with an alleged\nfalse statement in a warrant affidavit. This case involves an alleged false statement in a hearing\nto modify a protective order to allou a grand jury subpoena. Franks involved a claim under the\nFourth Amendment, while Maxwell couches hers in the Fifth. But while not identical, these\nsetings are closely analogous. Each involves alleged misstatements to a court that alloued the\nGovernment to obtain evidence. Each presents a risk of a defense fishing expedition where no\nwrongdoing appears on the face of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Each requires balancing\nsimilar interests—deterrence of deliberate misconduct on the one hand, and suppression of\nevidence inevitably discovered or obtained through innocent error on the other. The Second\nCircuit has already extended Franks past its precise factual context to a motion to suppress based\non alleged misrepresentations in a wiretap <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. See United States v. Rajaratnam, 7l9\nF.3d l39, l5l (2d Cir. 2ol3). The Court concludes that Maxwell must at least meet this standard\nfor a similar claim invoking the Court’s inherent authority.\n\nMaxwell must thus make a substantial preliminary shouing on each of Franks’\nrequirements to justify an evidentiary hearing. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll3 (2d\nCir. l998). That is, she must first make a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4799", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel6of2l\ndeliberately or recklessly misrepresented facts to Judge McMahon. Second, she must make a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing that Judge McMahon would have denied the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> absent any such misrepresentation. The Court finds that Maxwell has not made a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing on either prong.\n\nMaxwell’s argument here centers on the Government’s statements to Judge McMahon\nduring the second proceeding on April 9, 2ol9, concerning its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to modify the\nprotective order. At that proceeding, Judge McMahon explained that she wanted to make sure\nthe Government’s request did not present a similar situation to that in Chemical Bank v.\nAffiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), where a party in civil litigation urged\nprosecutors to instigate a criminal investigation and then provided confidential documents in\nviolation of a protective order. To that end, she asked the Government to explain “contacts\nbetween the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of\nthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation.” The prosecutor at that hearing informed\nJudge McMahon about all communications between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF after\nthe current investigation began—namely, that the Government told the firm that it intended to\nmake a document request and that the firm told the Government that some of the materials were\nsubject to a protective order. Although the prosecutor was included on an email several months\nearlier from the AUSA who met with Giuffre’s atorneys in 2ol6, he did not inform Judge\nMcMahon about any communications with BSF before the current investigation began.\n\nMaxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government’s\nstatement was a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation. The AUSA could reasonably have\nunderstood Judge McMahon’s question to concern only communications about the\nGovernment’s current investigation. Maxwell contends that the question asked for any\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel7 of 2l\ncommunications between BSF and the Government related to Epstein or Maxwell. But an\nequally plausible understanding of the phrase “‘on the subject of your investigation” is “related to\nthe investigation itself.” That interpretation is all the more reasonable in context, because\nChemical Bank involved communications between a party subject to a protective order and\nprosecutors during a pending criminal investigation. See Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. It\nwas not unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that Judge McMahon was concerned with\nthose sorts of communications, not communications years earlier that did not lead to a criminal\ninvestigation. The Government has represented that its present investigation into Epstein (and\nlater Maxwell) began only follouing publication of the Miami Herald expose in 2ol8. Maxwell\nhas made no substantial preliminary shouing to the contrary.\n\nThe Court also concludes that Maxwell has made no substantial preliminary shouing that\nJudge McMahon would have denied the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to modify the protective order\nif she knew about the 2ol6 communications. Materiality under Franks requires more than that a\nfact be important. It allous suppression only if “the allegedly false statement is necessary” to\nthe court’s finding. Franks, 438 U.S. at l56 (emphasis added). If Judge McMahon would still\nhave ruled that the Government was entitled to ex parte modification of the protective order even\nafter seting aside the Government’s alleged misrepresentation, then Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression. Judge McMahon’s opinion reflects that she would have.\n\nJudge McMahon’s ruling rested on two independent grounds. Analyzing the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> under Martindell, she first held that Maxwell could not have\nreasonably relied on the protective order to keep the Government from obtaining documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Judge McMahon reasoned that a civil litigant ordinarily may\nnot rely on a protective order subject to modification to keep evidence out of the hands of\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors. As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Page 2o of 2l\nentitled to deference. As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is necessary or appropriate in these circumstances. If\nnecessary, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a protective order in her earlier civil\ncase. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o8 Filed o7/ol/2l Pagelofl\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK I I yeti\nDATE FILED:_7/l/2o2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request. The Circuit Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that, because the agreement was not formalized and accepted by the\ncourt, the defendant was not entitled to specific performance under a contract law theory.\nId. at 362. The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the\nprosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his\nright to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, houever, that, by contrast, when a\n“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this\ninduced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24\n\nConsidered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their\nword, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full\nunderstanding of the circumstances, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of\none or more constitutional rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or\ndecisions under principles of contract law or by <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the fundamental fairness\nconsiderations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 66 of 8o\nAmendment's self-incrimination clause “is not only a protection against conviction and\nprosecution but a safeguard of conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression\nas well.” Ullmann v.

(l5-cv- |\n7433, Dkt. No. l.) Boies Schiller represented the plaintiff in the litigation, and continues to :\nrepresent her on a pending post-setlement appeal, which is described belou. |\nOn March 3, 2ol6, Maxwell moved before the assigned judge, the Hon.

Atacks on the Protective Order |\n\nBoth during and after the setlement of the Giuffre Action, third parties made highly- |\npublicized applications to have documents that were filed under seal by order of Judge Sweet |\nunsealed and made public. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 362, 55o, 935.) Harvard Law professor and |\ncriminal defense lawyer Alan Dershouitz, whom Giuffre publicly alleged of perpetrating sex |\ncrimes alongside Epstein, moved to unseal a limited portion of the record in order to clear his |\nname. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 364 at l.) Alt-right activist and provocateur Michael Cernovich |\nalso sought to unseal the papers filed as part of Maxwell’s motion for summary judgment, |\narguing, “Cernovich Media cannot conduct its Forth [sic] Estate function if this Court allous the |\nParties to conduct theit dispute outside of the normal sunlight of transparency and accessibility.” |\n(l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 55l at l.) The Miami Herald Media Company and investigative journalist |\nI\n\nJulie Broun, whose feature story about Epstein recently garnered significant public interest, also |\nmoved post-setlement to unseal the entire record. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 936.) |\nAll such applications were denied by Judge Sweet. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 439 (sealed), |\n\n892, 953.) A consolidated appeal from the orders denying the unsealing motions is currently |\npending before the Second Circuit. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir.), On March 6, :\n2ol9, the Court of Appeals heard argument on the consolidated appeal, which was widely |\ncovered in the legal press. I think it is fair to say that during the argument, the panel seemed |\ncritical of the district court’s failure to make specific findings about why any particular document :\nas to which unsealing was sought should remain sealed.

See |\nIn re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d l22l, l225 (2d Cir. |\nl99l) (“The proper procedure .., is... to subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a |\npending proceeding such as a grand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised |\n2 All materials under this docket number, l9-mc-l49, including this opinion, will be kept under seal as |\nrelated to a pending grand jury investigation. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo88o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo493o |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004931.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 8 of 27\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nby motion to quash or modify the subpoena . . . or to seek permissive intervention in the private\naction.”) (internal quotations omited); but see Palmieri v. State of N.Y., 779 F.2d 86l, 862 (2d\n\nCir. l985) (considering appeal where the New York State Atorney General, rather than the :\nsubject of the subpoena, was the moving party). |\nDuring the conference, the Government was not able to explain why it, rather than Boies |\nSchiller, made the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, Boies Schiller is perfectly capable of protecting its oun interests.\nThe law firm’s failure to seek for itself permission to respond to the subpoena seems particularly |\nmysterious in light of the fact that it has filed papers on behalf of Giuffre, in both the district and |\nappellate proceedings, supporting the intervenors’ applications to unseal the entire record, See, |\ne.g., Br. for Pl.-Appellee Virginia L. Giuffre, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir. Dec. 27, |\n2ol8), ECF No. 83 at l (“Ms. Giuffre . . . is nou prepared to have the world see what the record\ncontains.”). I suppose that Boies Schiller might not want to seem too cooperative with the |\n~ Government, especially if it is concerned about ending up as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging |\nbreach of contract if it has failed to return or destroy the Confidential Materials in its possession. |\nSee Aioi Nissay Doua Ins. Co. v. ProSight Specialty Mgmt. Co., No. l2-cv-3274, 2ol2 WL |\n3583l76, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2l, 2ol2). But that does not strike this Court as a reason for the |\nGovernment to carry the firm’s water—the moreso because Judge Sweet ruled some months |\nbefore he died that the intervenors’ appeals in Giuffre meant the lawsuit had not “concluded,” ,\nand so had postponed the day when that contractual obligation kicked in. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n967 at 6.)\na This ruling came in response to a motion by Maxwell to compel Giuffre’s compliance with the document\ndestruction provision. It argued that Giuffre’s obligations thereunder were triggered at the time of setlement. (l5- :\nmm Dkt. Nos. 957.) Judge Sweet denied that motion in light of the pending appeals. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo88l |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo493l |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 27 |\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order. Permissive |\nintervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |\nprotective order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na protective order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o |\n(2d Cir. l986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |\nTel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l, 294 (2d Cir. l979)], that ‘this extraordinary writ [mandamus] would |\nhardly be available ... where the only purpose was to obtain modification of a pretrial order for |\ninvestigative purposes.’”), Or it could have filed a writ of mandamus, since “mandamus lies to |\ncompel a judge to unseal documents shoun to be material and necessary in litigation,” United |\nStates v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 423 (2d Cir. l983). But the Government has done neither of the |\nabove; instead, it has moved pursuant to the All Writs Act. It cites no authority for that |\nprocedure. |\nNonetheless, there is precedent in this Circuit for granting procedurally puzzling :\napplications by the Government to unseal materials for use by a grand jury. For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations. Jd. at 42o-2l. On appeal, the Second Circuit rejected the defendant- |\nappellants’ argument that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting the |\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>: “A court may direct access to such material upon a proper shouing of\nSDNY_GM_ooooo882\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4932 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nneed. Here such a shouing was amply demonstrated. To have refused access to these records in |\nthe face of a subpoena from a grand jury would have been an abuse of discretion.” Jd. at 423. |\nI will, therefore, consider the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. |\nB. The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., lo4 |\nF.R.D. 559, 57o (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd, 82l F.2d l39 (2d Cir. l987) (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d |\nat 295). The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nand that such an order should not be vacated or modified merely to accommodate the |\nGovernment’s desire to inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal |\ninvestigation[.]” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.\nSince Martindell, “It is well-setled [in this Circuit] .. . that a Rule 26(c) protective order |\n\nmay be overturned or modified [only] based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary |\ncircumstances or compelling need.” Andover Data Servs., a Div. of Players Computer, Inc. v. |\nStatistical Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir. l989). Moreover, the Second Circuit |\nhas held that Martindell applies to the Government, as well as to any other third party seeking to |\nmodify a protective order. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229 n.7. |\nThe Government argues that Martindell should not apply to the instant <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, for |\n\nthree reasons. (Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-5.) |\nFirst, it argues that the rule of Martindell is inapplicable because here the grand jury |\n\nissued a valid and proper subpoena to Boies Schiller, while in Martindell the Government “‘was |\nproceeding outside of its usual investigative pouers to secure the requested testimony, not by |\ngrand jury subpoena,’ Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422.” (See Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-4.) Houever, the |\nstatement from Davis that is quoted above concerned the testimony of a non-party appellant |\nwhose testimony was not subject to a Rule 26(c) protective order, but rather to an informal )\n“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing. Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. |\nThe opinion underscored that the parties’ unwriten understanding about the confidentiality of\nthis deponent’s testimony would not trump a formal grand jury subpoena. That discussion is |\nirrelevant to the question of whether this Court is required to apply the Martindell rule in |\nevaluating this <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo884 |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4934 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004935.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 27\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nSecond, the Government argues that Martindell does not apply when “as here, the\nprotective order is on its face temporary or limited.” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 4.) But the Protective\nOrder in this case is at least arguably not temporary or limited. It would have expired had the |\ncase gone to trial, but, as the case setled, it appears to me to bind the parties permanently. It is |\ntrue that nothing in the Protective Order seems to prevent either Giuffre or Maxwell from |\nmaking public documents that were designated confidential by that party once the lawsuit is |\nover. Houever, as to documents designated confidential by the other party, the promise of |\nconfidentiality plainly survives termination of the lawsuit—even to the point of requiring that :\nthose materials be returned or destroyed. ;\nThird, the Government argues that applying Martindell to its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> here “would risk |\nrendering | Martindell] in even further conflict with the well-reasoned decisions of numerous |\nother Circuits,” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5 n.3.) Martindell is indeed an outlier; every other Circuit |\n|\nthat has considered the clash between protective orders and grand jury subpoenas has questioned |\nits wisdom and has come up with a standard more favorable to the Government’s position. See |\ngenerally Dane L. Steffenson, Are Rule 26(c) Protective Orders Viable Against Grand Juries?, |\n26 Golden Gate U. L. Rev. l83 (l996); 8A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2o44.l (3d ed. Nov. 2ol8). |\nI happen to agree with the other Circuits, but Martindell is the law in this Circuit, and I am not at |\nliberty to ignore it. |\nThe Government argues that the Court should decline to analyze its request pursuant to |\nMartindell in light of Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), |\nLike this case, Chemical Bank arose in a somewhat unusual posture: a party to a protective order |\nunilaterally approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office, “suggesting that it had :\nevidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” Jd. at 93. The District Atorney then issued |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo885 !\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4935 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004936.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l3 of 27\n: To Be Filed Under Seal\n\na grand jury subpoena, with which the party (the defendant) complied. At no point did the\ndefendant seek relief from the protective order. Id. When the other party to the protective order |\nlearned of the defendant’s blatant disregard of its obligations, it moved for sanctions in the civil |\naction. Id.\nThe district court condemned the defendant’s behavior as “entirely unnecessary and |\ninappropriate,” but nonetheless refused to sanction the defendant—apparently because, had the |\ndefendant sought relief from that order, the judge would have granted its request. Jd. at 93-94, |\nWhile the Martindell factors were never mentioned expressly by the district court, Judge |\nBroderick observed that the confidentiality order did not implicate “technological trade secrets, |\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which |\ncould benefit rivals”—factors that, if present, he would have had more difficulty balancing |\nagainst the investigative needs of law enforcement. Id. at 94. |\nThere are three reasons why Chemical Bank does not justify this Court’s refusing to |\napply the Martindell factors to the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. First and foremost, the opinion of ,\nanother district judge does not trump an opinion from the Second Circuit. Second, while a reader |\nof Chemical Bank cannot be certain whether the district court complied with Martindell, the |\n|\nlanguage quoted above certainly suggests that the district court engaged in the balancing exercise |\nthat Martindell contemplated. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the Government’s |\ninvestigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I will return later |\nin this opinion. |\nThe Court will, therefore, analyze the Government’s request in light of the Martindell |\nfactors. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo886 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4936 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order. And |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89l |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494l |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2l of 27 |\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal |\nthat confidentiality originated with the consent of the parties, and not with a judicial |\ndetermination that the materials at issue were deserving of protection, militates against a finding :\nof reasonable reliance. “[C]ourts have been reluctant to find reliance, or that reliance was |\nreasonable, where a protective order is, as here, a blanket order entered by stipulation of the |\nparties.” In re NASDAQ Mkt.-Makers Antitrust Litig., l64 F.R.D. 346, 356 (S.D.N.Y. l996). |\nAs for the last factor, the nature of the parties’ reliance on the order does seem to weigh |\nagainst modification. “The classic situation in which a party ‘relies’ on a protective order is |\nwhere the party creates material during the course of the litigation on the understanding that it |\nwill be kept confidential—for example, by . . . giving confidential testimony.” Allen v. City of |\nN.Y., 42o F. Supp. 2d 295, 3oo-ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6). The record shous that Giuffre likely could |\nnot have secured Maxwell’s deposition—at least in the absence of substantial court |\ninvolvement—without the Protective Order.® Maxwell specifically mentioned “the specter of |\nsome theoretical prosecution” when arguing in support of the entry of her version of the |\nProtective Order, Although, as noted above, she discounted the likelihood of any such |\nprosecution (see supra, at l8.), she argued that, “A witness adverse to Plaintiff would be :\nreluctant to testify and may be bullied into asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid the |\npotential of information being forwarded to a prosecutor by the Plaintiff or her lawyers.” (Def.’s |\nReply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt.

More to the point, “Uncertainty about the ultimate |\noutcome of a protective order will mean that no deponent may always effectively rely on a |\nprotective order to secure his right against self-incrimination.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d |\nat lo84 (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)). |\nBecause Maxwell’s reliance on the Protective Order to shield her from the court-ordered |\ndisclosure of Confidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the |\nCourt may exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. “Where a litigant or |\ndeponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of a protective order, a court may |\nproperly permit modification of the order.

In )\nMartindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |\n“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the maters in connection with |\nwhich the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |\ngrand jury investigative processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |\nthe mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 4o |\nF.3d 592 (2d Cir. l994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :\nshouing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |\none day invoke the Fifth Amendment at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |\nprosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |\ncivil proceeding]... [.] Prosecutors often make do without the testimony of a defendant.” Jd. at |\n595-96 (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296). |\nHere, houever, the extraordinary amount of publicity surrounding all aspects of what I |\nwill call the Epstein mater does create practical limitations to the grand jury’s ability to secure |\ncertain information with the secrecy it requires to conduct an appropriately thorough and |\nthoughtful investigation. Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a situation in |\nwhich the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |\nindependently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743. This is not a case, like United States v. :\nOshatz, 7oo F.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, |\nl99l, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the bankruptcy examination, which |\nincluded deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nEven though I do not currently represent Ms. Maxwell in any proceedings and\nhave never entered an appearance in connection with her trial before Your Honor, the\nGovernment submited a leter “to bring to the Court’s atention” an article that I wrote\non June 3o, 2o2l, and asked that the Court “issue an order pursuant to Local Rule\n23.l(h)” directed at me. (Dkt. No. 3o9). This Court ordered that I respond (Dkt. No.\n3l2), and I do so here. I respectfully request that the Court deny the Government’s\nrequest for the follouing reasons:\n\nI. The local rules do not apply as I do not currently represent Ghislaine\nMaxwell in any proceeding and have not entered an appearance in\nthis Court.\n\nBecause undersigned counsel does not currently represent Ms. Maxwell in any\ncourt and has never entered an appearance as her lawyer in this Court, the local rules\ndo not apply. See, e.g., Local Rule 23.l(h) (explaining that the Court “may issue a\nspecial order governing such maters as extrajudicial statements by parties and\nwitnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial by an impartial\njury’) (emphasis added). Because undersigned counsel does not represent a party ora\nwitness, the Government’s request should be denied.\n\nUndersigned counsel was previously retained to represent Ms. Maxwell’s family.\nThen, when this Court denied her third bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, undersigned counsel was\nretained to represent Ms. Maxwell in the Second Circuit on her bail appeal (and not\nregarding the merits of the case). That proceeding is concluded, and undersigned\ncounsel no longer represents Ms. Maxwell in any capacity.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4955", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 _ Filed o7/3o/2l Pagellof3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT Sree ieee\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: //3o/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Government has moved for an order requiring David Markus to comply with Local\nCriminal Rule 23.l follouing an op-ed that he authored opining on the merits of this pending\ncase. Dkt. No. 3o9.\n\nMr. Markus is plainly a lawyer associated with the defense in this case. His formal\nrepresentation has involved handling at least one pre-trial issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular,\nappeals to the Second Circuit of this Court’s bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. l73; see also\nUnited States v. Maxwell, Nos. 2l-58-cr(L), 2l-77o-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held\nhimself out as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the\nop-ed at issue in the Government’s leter <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, which describes him as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” He has also atended a proceeding in this mater and spoken on Ms.\nMaxwell’s behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell’s atorney. See\nStephen Rex Broun, Ghislaine Maxwell Makes First In-Person NYC Court Appearance, N.Y.\nDaily News (Apr. 23, 2o2l), htps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-ghislaine-maxwell-\narraignment-2o2 lo423-b3azaSeh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html.\n\nNevertheless Mr. Markus argues that he is not subject to Rule 23.l because he does not\ncurrently represent Ms. Maxwell in any proceedings and has not made an appearance in this\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l5 Filed o7/3o/2l Page2of3\nCourt. Dkt. No. 3l4. Rule 23.l is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the\nrule limits its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary,\nas the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others)\n“associated” with “pending or imminent criminal litigation.” S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule\n23.l(a) (last updated Oct. 29, 2ol8); see also Rule 23.l(b) (“a lawyer participating in or\nassociated with the investigation’); Rule 23.l(c) (“lawyer or law firm associated with the\nprosecution or defense”). An atorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently\n“associated” with a case as to justify <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial\nstatements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess\ninformation that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold\ngreater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. l982); see also People v. Butafuoco,\n599 N.Y.S.2d 4l9 (Nassau Cty. Ct. l993).\n\nSuch is the case with Mr. Markus’s role in the pending mater. As noted, Mr. Markus has\natended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell’s behalf.\nHe has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court’s pre-trial bail determinations.\nMoreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer in a published\nop-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which\nincludes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information\nregarding the pending mater and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable.\nMr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and\nthe Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.l given the potential lack of clarity\nwith respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4963", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 329 Filed o8/25/2l Pageilofil\n[UspcspNy\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: 8/25/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Apr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nOn April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l, the Court denied Maxwell’s request for an order\nauthorizing issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Boies, Schiller, Flexner LLP. See Dkt. Nos.\n252, 298. In doing so, the Court noted that the requests contained in that proposed subpoena all\nfailed the Nixon test. The proposed subpoenas to these four individuals seek similar materials,\nand the subpoenas fail for similar reasons.\n\nA. Subpoena Recipient-l\n\nThe Court begins with the proposed subpoenas to Subpoena Recipient-l. The proposed\nsubpoena to her makes five requests which overlap entirely with requests contained in the\nproposed subpoena to BSF. Specifically, Maxwell requests (l) any contingent fee and\nengagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-land any atorneys; (2) Subpoena\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o3l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Pagelooflo\nIi.

The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936).

Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case.

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 4o\nprivate rather than public,” which avoids “catering” to “sensational” interests. (Gov’t Mot. at l6\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995); United States v. Cohen, 366\nF. Supp. 3d 6l2, 626-627 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (alterations and internal quotation marks omited)).\nThis limited sealing request is significantly protective of the interests of the Minor Victims, who\nwere sexually abused as minors, and minimally burdensome to the public. See Paris, 2oo7 WL\nl484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim identities outweighs the public\ninterest in access to information because “the public and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’\nand Minors’ testimony in full’); cf. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9 (d)(2) (permiting any papers that disclose\nthe name of a child to be filed under seal without the necessity of a court order). !”\n\nAlthough the defense argues that this request is “contrary to well-established Second\nCircuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor of access\nassociated with public dissemination of records that are already shared publicly at trial. See United\nStates v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l49 (2d Cir. 2ool); <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of National Broadcasting Co.,\n635 F.2d 945, 95l-52 (2d Cir. l98o). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies\nfor evidence submited under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of\ncourt was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at l49 (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of National Broadcasting\nCo., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared\nin open court, so these cases are inapposite.\n\nTo the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at\n22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5575", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel4 of 24\nassault. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from\npsychologist in prosecution for traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex\nwith a minor because psychologist’s “experience in the field of child sexual abusers and their\nvictims is one-sided, as it is limited to therapeutic sessions with victims of sexual abuse,” and\nbecause she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l-NGG-\nVMS, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.\nEssef Corp., 434 F.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v.

Al-Sadawi,\n432 F.3d 4l9 (2d Cir. 2oo5) and Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3, to exclude evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell’s supposed “flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the\ngovernment from arguing to the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law\nenforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of, her arrest, or that her conduct during this time\nperiod is proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from\npublic view after Epstein’s arrest was emphatically not for the purpose of evading detection by\nlaw enforcement, but instead was an effort to protect herself and her family members from an\nonslaught of intrusive media atention and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\nintroduce evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\nconsciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\nunsupported inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl4\nthat would confuse the issues in the case and cause undue delay. It should therefore be precluded\nunder Rule 4o3.\n\nBACKGROUD\nThe government repeatedly and erroneously argued in the context of Ms. Maxwell’s bail\napplications that Ms. Maxwell went into “hiding” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein to avoid\ndetection by law enforcement. See 7/2/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Supp. of Detention (Dkt. oo4) at 8\n(“[Ms. Maxwell] made intentional efforts to avoid detection”); 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in\nSupp. of Detention (Dkt. o22) at 8 (measures that Ms. Maxwell took “to conceal herself” after\nEpstein’s indictment “are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement”); l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s\nRenewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant\nwas hiding not just from the press, but also from law enforcement.”). The government also\nrepeatedly and erroneously argued that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct at the time of her arrest\nevidenced an intent to evade law enforcement. See 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in Supp. of\nDetention (Dkt. o22) at 7-8; 7/l4/2o2o Tr. of Bail Hrg. at 3l:2o-34:5; l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in\nOpp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l-22.\nThe government’s assertion rests on groundless speculation concerning actions which\nMs. Maxwell was forced to take in the days after Epstein’s arrest to protect herself and her\nfamily and friends from unrelenting harassment by the media and the very real danger of\nphysical threats against them. In particular, the government has noted the follouing in its prior\nsubmissions:\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5692", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page /7ofl4\nmorning of her arrest, which had nothing to do with evading capture by law enforcement. See\nid., Ex. S 79 4-l3. This individual stated that he had spoken to the security guard who was on\nduty with Ms. Maxwell that morning. /d. 47. The security guard reported that he had seen a\nhelicopter flying above the property in the early morning hours and assumed it was the press. Jd.\nBelieving that the press had discovered the property, the head of the security company instructed\nthe security guard to prepare Ms. Maxwell to move to a safe room in the event that the perimeter\nof the property were breached. /d. Roughly two hours later, the security guard saw vehicles\napproaching the residence and again assumed they were members of the press, not FBI agents.\nId. 9§ 8-9. He radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that members of the press were on the grounds\nand approaching the house. /d. 4 9. Ms. Maxwell then folloued a pre-established safety\nprotocol that she had been instructed to follou in the event that her security was threatened while\nshe was inside the residence. /d. 9 lo-ll. Pursuant to the protocol, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. Jd. Ms. Maxwell was not trying to\navoid arrest; she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself from\nwhat she had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained at the initial bail hearing and in\nMs. Maxwell’s second bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from\naccessing her phone after the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with\nthe phone number unredacted. See l2/l4/2o2o Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Bail\n(Dkt. 97) at 24. Moreover, the cell phone was subscribed in the name of Ms. Maxwell’s charity\nand was therefore easily traceable to Ms. Maxwell. See id. at 24-25.\n\nIn sum, the government cannot establish a sufficient factual predicate to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell’s actions were evidence of flight, much less evidence of consciousness of guilt.

Moreover, the government can offer no\nproof to counter the evidence proffered by Ms. Maxwell in her bail submission and instead relies\non its vague and unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal Ms. Maxwell’s intent to evade\nlaw enforcement. See l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt.\nloo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the\npress, but also from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding Ms. Maxwell’s\npurported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks any factual foundation and would be highly\nprejudicial. It should therefore be excluded.4\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\n“TT]t is widely acknouledged that evidence of flight or related conduct is ‘only\nmarginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 55o\nF.2d lo36, lo49 (5 Cir. l977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir.\nl973)). While flight can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory\nfactual predicate must exist from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”\nbefore such evidence may properly be admited. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (citations omited).\n“Since flight evidence can be pouerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures\nthat the evidence is probative in a legal sense and protects the defendant against the possibility of\nthe jury drawing unsupported inferences from otherwise innocuous behavior.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Amuso, 2l F.3d l25l, l26o (2d Cir. l994)).\n4 Tn its Opinion and Order denying Ms. Maxwell’s second bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court did not resolve whether Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein was designed to protect herself from the press or evade law\nenforcement. See l2/28/2o2o Op. and Order (Dkt. lo6) at l9. We submit that it was clearly the former. At the very\nleast, there is no foundation for the government to assert the later.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5695", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page /7 of 84\n\n579, 588 (l993) (quoting Beech Aircraft Corp. v.

Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat’l RR.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). “[T]hese criteria,” houever, “are not\nexhaustive.” Jd. Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94).

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to once again ask the Court to release Ghislaine Maxwell prior to trial on the\nconditions set forth in her previous bail applications. My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating circumstances that I have ever experienced in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice. As disturbing and invasive as they are for no\njustifiable reason, I get to leave; Ms. Maxwell does not. The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr.\nHannibal Lecter’s incarceration as portrayed in the movie, “Silence of the Lambs,” despite the\nabsence of the cage and plastic face guard. Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention for the past\nl6 months continue to be reprehensible and uterly inappropriate for woman on the cusp of\nturning 6o with no criminal record or history of violence. It is unwarranted, unrelenting, and\nuterly inappropriate.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the correction officers,\npoor and unsanitary living conditions, insufficient nutrition, difficulties reviewing the millions of\nlegal discovery documents in the case against her, and sleep deprivation. She has been\nconsistently housed in segregation from all other inmates, with rotating teams of multiple\ncorrections officers per daily shift which rotate on a bi-weekly basis. Many of the officers are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page6eof7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived. Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse. Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future. Marshal Ralph Sozio\npromptly responded and informed me that the issue is under investigation.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page3ofll\nPage 3\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be insufficient” because\nthe defendant could remove the monitor and evade private guards. (/d. at 87-88).\n\nFinally, the Court rejected the defendant’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the\ndifficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated client, noting that the defendant had many\nmonths to prepare for trial. (/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2. The Court’s Second Detention Order\n\nThe defendant renewed her bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in December 2o2o, presenting a revised bail\npackage with additional financial restrictions. (Dkt. 97). After receiving further writen\nsubmissions (Dkt. loo, lo3), the Court denied the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in a writen opinion\nissued on December 28, 2o2o. (Dkt. lo6 (“Second Order”)). The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.\n(/d. at 2). The Court rejected the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of\nits case at the bail hearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o n.3).\n\n3. The Court’s Third Detention Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d.\nat 7).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Pageloofll\nPage lo\ncompromised. (See, e.g., Dkt. 282 at 2 (finding “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers”)).\n\nFinally, in a single paragraph, the defendant argues that the Jencks Act and Giglio material\nshe has received “contradict the purported ‘strength’ of the government’s case.” (Def. Mot. 6). But\nthat claim is supported by only the most conclusory of assertions that “there is no independent\ncorroboration” for the victims’ statements and that they “demonstrate contamination and collusion\nfrom various sources.” (/d.). The defendant has made such arguments about the strength of the\nGovernment’s case before (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at l9; Dkt. 97 at 3o-33; Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and each\ntime the Court has rejected the defendant’s bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. (See, e.g., Second Order at 9-lo\n(rejecting the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of its case at the bail\nhearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony”)). Moreover, since\nthe Court’s third detention order, the Court has also rejected the defendant’s pretrial motions to\ndismiss the charges (Dkt. 2o7, 3l7), the pendency of which the defendant had also claimed\nundermined the strength of the case (see, e.g., Dkt. l7l at 7-8), and a grand jury returned a\nsuperseding indictment charging additional counts based on an additional victim, and the\nGovernment intends to prove the existence of two additional victims at trial. Thus, the defendant’s\nlatest ipse dixit about the victims does not in fact “undermine the strength of the government’s\ncase.” (Def. Mot. 6). Quite the contrary, that the defendant is this close to trial and still cannot\nmake a more compelling argument about the strength of the case underscores what has been\napparent from the Government’s first proffer: the case is strong.\n\nThe defendant’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006300.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3of:\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v.

On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v.

In so arguing, she expresses concern that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will “‘radically\nsimplify’ an otherwise complex case” by “‘foist[ing] a damning teleology on a series of actions\neach of which might have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all.’” (Def.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant has subpoenaed four categories of information: (l) copies of any payments\nto the Minor Victims and their counsel, and (2) “[a]ny and [all [r]eleases executed by the [Minor\n? Although generally “production of impeaching evidence pursuant to Rule l7(c) is not required\nuntil after the witness testifies,” Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2, in this case the Government\nexpects each of the Minor Victims named in the subpoena to testify at trial. Accordingly, if the\nCourt permits enforcement of the subpoena, the Government does not object to production of the\nrecords to the Court before the Minor Victims actually testify for the sake of efficiency.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\nharmed by conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy—and she was—then she is a “victim” under\nthe relevant statutes.\n\nFinally, Minor Victim-3 is also a “victim” for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2,\nbecause she is clearly someone who “can reasonably be characterized as a ‘victim of alleged sexual\nmisconduct.’” Fed. R. Evid. 4l2, Advisory Commitee Notes (l994). Given Rule 4l2’s broad\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in not just criminal cases but also civil cases such as claims of sexual harassment, see\nWolak v. Spucci, 2l7 F.3d l57, l6o (2d Cir. 2ooo), it cannot be read to define victims as only those\nindividuals whose victimization would alone satisfy all of the elements of a charged crime. As set\nforth above, Epstein’s conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 is plainly “alleged sexual\nmisconduct,” and therefore she is a victim as defined in Rule 4l2.\n\nFor these reasons, Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under the provisions of federal law\ndiscussed above. Moreover, the Government respectfully submits that even if its reading of these\nprovisions is incorrect, that does not affect the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony as\ndirect evidence: evidence that does not itself establish every element of the charged crime may\nnevertheless be admissible as direct evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l,\n942 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo). And Minor Victim-\n3’s status as a “victim” under the foregoing provisions of law certainly does not affect the\nadmissibility of her testimony under Rule 4o4(b), which permits the admission of other act\ntestimony that almost by definition does not satisfy the elements of the charged crime. The\ntestimony should be admited.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 497 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page8oflil\nl Rules of Conduct\n2 Finally, let me caution you about certain rules and principles governing your\n3. conduct as jurors in this case.

So he's saying accurately that we\nl6 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n\nl7 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is\nl8 used to describe a process, a patern of behaviors. I'm not\n\nl9 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these\n2o particular behaviors, yes, we knou you're a child abuser. So\n2l he's making that point. But I don't think anybody —- I don't\n22 think that —- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with\n23 that.

This testimony, too, would not be\nprivileged, but it is irrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nKate testified that, at a meeting, she asked the Government to look into sponsoring her for\na U-Visa.

And the fact that her lawyer provided\nthe Government with a U-Visa form is not “pouerful evidence of motive of bias,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Leter at 6). First, as with Scarola’s proposed testimony, it could only be evidence\nof Kate’s bias to the extent she is aware of the fact, a predicate which the defense did not establish.\nSecond, it is not “pouerful” evidence of anything. Kate acknouledged asking the Government\nabout a U-Visa. Whether her lawyer, at the same time, gave the Government a partially complete\nU-Visa form is at most marginally confirming extrinsic evidence of Kate’s oun testimony. It does\nnot shou, for instance, that Kate or Edwards continued to seek a U-Visa after the meeting, that she\ncontinues to seek one nou, or that the Government has made any promises to Kate of any kind\nabout her immigration status, nor could the defense argue any of that from the anticipated\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document567 Filed ol/o3/22 Pagelofl\nUSDC SDNY\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED:_ l/3/22\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Jul. l4, 2oo8) (declining to\nunseal search warrant applications and affidavits because “[i]f such information is disclosed to the\nsubjects of investigations before the institution of charges, there exists a risk that those individuals\ncould conceal or destroy other evidence, influence information and testimony given by others, and\notherwise delay and obstruct the investigation.’’)\n\nJudge Caproni’s decision in United States v. Silver offers a useful example. In Si/ver, the\ngovernment filed under seal a pretrial motion in limine, which described the defendant’s extra-\nmarital affairs and sought permission to admit this evidence if the defendant put at issue his ethics\nor integrity or his character for truthfulness and honesty, among other things. Si/ver, 2ol6 WL\nl572993, at *l. Judge Caproni heard argument on the motion in a closed proceeding two weeks\nbefore trial and ruled that the submissions on this issue would remain under seal until the\nconclusion of the trial due to the concern that public disclosure of the defendant’s extramarital\naffairs so close to trial would “increase the difficulty of picking a jury” and thereby impact the\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. /d. at *2, *8. Follouing the defendant’s conviction, Judge\nCaproni gave the parties the opportunity to brief whether the submissions should remain sealed.\nId. at *2. She ultimately ruled that the fair trial concerns that led her to temporarily seal the\nsubmissions no longer existed and ordered them to be unsealed. /d. at *8.\n\nThe Court should follou the example of Judge Caproni in Si/ver. Here, to protect Ms.\nMaxwell’s right to a fair trial, it is necessary to temporarily seal the Motion (and likely any\nadditional submissions on this issue) for a short period of time until the Court rules on the Motion\nor until any additional fact-finding process ordered by the Court is complete.

It was not until just before trial, after the\ngovernment had questioned her about the New Mexico trip in her preparation for trial, that Jane\nclaimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at\nthe ranch. See supra note l.\n\nJane’s new recollection about the New Mexico trip was disclosed at the eleventh hour\nand substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her defense. See id.

Because the Mann Act counts as charged in the Indictment were\nbased on a violation of New York law, the defense vigorously litigated the extent to which the\ngovernment could introduce evidence of sexual activity that occurred in jurisdictions outside of\nNew York in support of the Mann Act counts. As part of that effort, the defense requested\nlimiting instructions with respect to the testimony of Kate and Annie Farmer. The limiting\ninstructions, which were read to the jury immediately before the witnesses began their testimony,\nspecifically instructed the jury that any sexual conduct that Kate or Annie Farmer said occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein “was not ‘illegal sexual activity’ as the government has charged in the\nindictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2; Tr. 2o48:22-2o49:l.\n\nHad the defense been given sufficient notice that Jane would testify that she was sexually\nabused in New Mexico, we would have litigated this issue before trial and, at the very least,\nmade an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the Court to give a limiting instruction before the start of Jane’s testimony\nsimilar to the one given for Annie Farmer, who also testified about a single instance of sexual\ncontact at the ranch in New Mexico when she was l6 years old, which could not have violated\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8946", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o8 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page2of2\nCounsel so that he may make a knouing determination as to whether or not he “wishes to be heard\non the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry, briefing by the juror's counsel may be filed by\nJanuary 26, 2o22”.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l32", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been convicted” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009238.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBmctien en O34 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 36 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, vy\n\nPAUL M.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

Parse objects to being held\nresponsible, for Guidelines loss calculations purposes, for the full amount of loss generated by the\ncorrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Parse argues that “a fair\nreading of the jury’s verdict is that Parse was convicted only for his role in what the [Presentence]\nReport describes as three instances of fraudulent ‘backdating.’”\n\nDefendant Parse’s position is contrary to law and has no basis in reliable fact. First, Parse’s\ncontention that he is being held responsible for acquited conduct ignores the fact that he was\nconvicted on the broad corrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud.

And the Second Circuit has\napplied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough\nhearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). As the\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly warned, “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences:\nsubjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, ll9-2o (l987) (citing\nMcDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267-68 (l9l5)). And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to\nafford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o6 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nThe Defendant argues that the considerations in Tanner and Janniello are inapplicable to\nher motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9547", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page9of2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009616.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 626 Filed o3/o2/22 Page l of l\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nMarch 2, 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been convicted” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo988l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

Pauley, III\nMarch 7, 2ol3\nPage ll\n\nOur louer Guidelines calculation begins from the premise that Mr. Parse was\nconvicted only of the three “backdating” transactions. If that is so, then the proper loss\ncalculation is this:\n\nColeman $2,738,63o\n\nBlair $ 47o,o35\n\nAronoff $ 536,77o\n\nToporek h  '62:553\n\nTOTAL $3,8o7,988\nThese numbers are based on the additional assessments calculated by the IRS, which are in\nevidence.\n\nMoreover, if the Guidelines calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”\ntransactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered.

The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo383", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 658 Filed o5/lo/22 Page l of l\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nMay lo, 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of conviction” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 Guidelines apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually incorrect. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\nGuidelines in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which Guidelines book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that determination, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 Guidelines; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 Guidelines in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n? The five-point difference in the total offense level is driven by the base offense level. Under the 2oo3 Guidelines,\nthe applicable base offense level is l9. See USSG § 2Gl.l(a)(l) (2oo3). Under the 2oo4 Guidelines, the applicable\nbase offense level is 24. See USSG § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4).

The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\nrecollection of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\nconviction’ for ex post facto purposes and ... <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\nreasonable to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 Guidelines. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 Guidelines to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\nnevertheless vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 Guidelines apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier Guidelines were in effect.

(“A judge might reasonably conclude that a sentence based almost entirely on\nevidence that satisfied only the normal civil standard of proof would be unlikely to promote\nrespect for the law or provide just punishment for the offense of conviction.”). Accordingly, the\nCourt should exercise its discretion to vary from the 2oo4 Guidelines and sentence Ms. Maxwell\nunder the 2oo3 Guidelines. See id. (the § 3553(a) sentencing factors “are broad enough and\nloose enough to allou the judge to dip belou the guidelines range if he is justifiably reluctant to\nimpose a sentence most of which rests entirely on a finding of fact supported by a mere\npreponderance of the evidence”).\n\nIl. The Five-Point Adjustment Under USSG § 4Bl.5 Does Not Apply.\n\nProbation and the government seek to substantially increase Ms. Maxwell’s Guidelines\nrange by adding a five-point adjustment under USSG § 4Bl.5 applicable to a “Repeat and\nDangerous Sex Offender Against Minors.” That one adjustment increases Ms. Maxwell’s\nadvisory sentencing range from l68-2lo months to 292-365 months — a roughly 75% increase.\nBut § 4Bl.5 was intended to apply only to habitual sexual offenders who present a high risk of\nrecidivism and pose “a continuing danger to the public.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background. The\nfacts of this case fall far outside the scenarios that Congress and the Sentencing Commission\nwere trying to address with § 4Bl.5. Here, the government concedes that the defendant is nota\ndanger to the public, there is no evidence that the defendant herself is sexually atracted to\nminors, the conduct that gives rise to the adjustment ended almost 2o years ago, and there is no\nevidence that the defendant has re-offended and no concern that she will ever re-offend.\nMoreover, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would lead to absurd results that the\nSentencing Commission did not contemplate. Section 4Bl.5 therefore does not apply.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel7 of 29\n\nThe case law bears this out. The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

McGrain, No. 6:2o-cr-o6ll3 (EAW), 2o22 WL 28735o, at *l-\n*6 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that\nassertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at 6o. It is\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo434", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l8 of 29\nnot. The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders. It\nfollous that convicted sex offenders who re-offend after being released from prison should\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo435", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2o of 29\n552 U.S. 85, lo8-o9 (2oo7) (“[A] district court may vary from the Guidelines range based solely\non a policy disagreement with the Guidelines, even where that disagreement applies to a wide\nclass of offenders or offenses.”).

The Guidelines are clear that for any of the three\naggravating role enhancements to apply, the Court must first find that Ms. Maxwell supervised at\nleast one other criminal participant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2 (“To qualify for an\nadjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or\nsupervisor of one or more other participants.” (emphasis added)); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d\nl46, l56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2). A “participant” is defined as “‘a person\nwho is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been\nconvicted.” USSG § 3Bl.l cmt. n.l; Skys, 637 F.3d at l56.\n\nThere is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offenses against “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn, which form the basis for the\nthree offense groups in the PSR. See PSR 4] 89-9o.” According to the trial testimony, the only\ncriminal participants in the offenses involving “Jane” and Annie Farmer were Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. There is certainly no support in the record that Ms. Maxwell supervised Epstein. In\nfact, the record is clear that the opposite is true: Epstein directed and managed Ms. Maxwell,\n\n7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is not a victim of the offenses of conviction, Probation and the government\nagree that the conduct related to “Kate” cannot be treated as a separate offense group and is not subject to a\nGuidelines analysis. See PSR at 58-59. We therefore do not address the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of any enhancements or\nadjustments based on evidence related to “Kate.” Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell\nsupervised another criminal participant in her offense conduct.\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo437", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page/7of77\nat the beach; and her husband, who was besieged by media coverage and had lost his employment\nand professional relationships. Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

The government has never argued, in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail applications or otherwise, that Ms. Maxwell is a danger to the community; nor could they.\nApart from the conduct at issue in this case, which occurred almost 2o to 3o years ago, Ms.\nMaxwell has never once been accused of a crime, much less sexual abuse of minors. In fact, after\nleaving Epstein, Ms. Maxwell was involved in commited, long-term relationships with two men,\nboth of whom had young children who continue to support her. Ms. Maxwell is not a dangerous\ncriminal or a habitual offender. She is someone who wants nothing more than to live a normal\nfamily life — something she was denied because of her association with Epstein and will nou\nalmost certainly never have. The public does not need to be protected from Ms. Maxwell and such\nconsiderations should have no weight in determining her sentence.\nA Guidelines Sentence is Not Necessary to Achieve Specific or General Deterrence\n\nA guidelines sentence for Ms. Maxwell would not serve the sentencing goals of either\nspecific or general deterrence. A significant sentence is not necessary to achieve the goal of\nindividual deterrence here. This is Ms. Maxwell’s only brush with the law. Ms. Maxwell has\nalready learned a painful lesson from her arrest and prosecution, has lost her marriage and her\nstepchildren, and has been harshly punished during pre-sentence incarceration. Ms. Maxwell\nhas already shoun that she will not reoffend and does not need to be further deterred from\ncommiting crimes in the future.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010508.jpg": "See Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 62 of 77\neee, om ee :\nani ____ Whilst | fully acknouledge the verdict of the Court, | continue to standby and support\naie peny Ne agi 5iter oo\nOO a ee\nae ___ Ghislaine.

During those meetings, I reviewed\nher personal, social, educational, vocational, and psychiatric histories. I performed a mental\nstatus examination to assess her intelligence, thought processes, cognitive functioning,\nmemory, credibility, orientation, judgment, insight, and impulse control. I reviewed numerous\nlegal correspondences between Ms. Maxwell’s legal counsel, MDC legal, and the Honorable\nAlison J. Nathan. Additionally, I conducted a collateral interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, part\nof Ms. Maxwell’s legal counsel and a longtime acquaintance, on July l6, 2o2l, to gain insight\ninto Ms. Maxwell’s current level of functioning.

Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel9 of 55\ncurrent version of the Guidelines as representing the most recent views of the agency charged by\nCongress with developing sentencing policy.” Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nWhere the Guidelines have increased after the offense conduct has concluded, “the court\nshall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was\ncommited.” U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l).

That is true even if the Guidelines were amended during the\ncourse of the offense conduct. The Second Circuit has explained that “[w]here a conspiracy began\nwhile one version of the Guidelines was in effect and ended after another version became effective,\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the later version to the coconspirators does not violate the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” United States v.

As a result, for Guidelines purposes,\nDecember 3l, 2oo4 is legally the last date of the offense conduct, and the 2oo4 Manual applies.\nIn her objections to the PSR, the defendant claims that the Ex Post Facto clause requires the jury,\nand not the Court, to determine the last date of the offense of conviction. The defendant further\nclaims that, as a factual mater, the offense conduct ended before November l, 2oo4, the date upon\nwhich the 2oo4 Manual became effective. For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant is wrong\nas a mater of law and as a mater of fact. The Court should apply the 2oo4 Manual.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo554", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2oof55\nl. The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply\n\nThe defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing\nGuidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument\nis inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The\nCourt should reject this argument.\n\nAs an initial mater, it is well setled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s\noffense level under the Guidelines need not be submited to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 56o F.\nApp’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Morel, No. lo Cr. 798 (PAC), 2o2l WL 282llo7,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2o2l). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of\nwhich Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court\nshould determine the last date of the conspiracy. <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Note 2 provides the follouing\nexample of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction\n(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was\nconvicted) was determined by the court to have been commited between October l5, l99l and\nOctober 28, l99l, the date of October 28, l99l is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2 (2oo4) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes\nplain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion\ninvolved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument\nentirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory\npenalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing\ndoes not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 26 of55\n“one involving five or more knouing participants” (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomited)). Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v. Kennedy, 233 F.3d l57, l6o-6l (2d Cir. 2ooo); see also Kent, 82l F.3d at 369\n(applying Carrozzella factors); United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l65-66 (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(same); United States v. Skys, 637 F.3d l46, l56-58 (2d Cir. 2oll) (same); United States v.\nRubenstein, 4o3 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Ritweger, 274 F. App’x 78,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 27 of 55\n\n82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (same). Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” prong\napplies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knouing participants; (i) the\nnumber of unknouing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with\nspecific criminal intent; (ill) the extent to which the services of the unknouing participants were\npeculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o3-o4. In seting out\nthese factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knouing participants” is “relevant” to\nthe analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knouing participants that is aided by unknouing\nparticipants is more likely to be ‘otherwise extensive’ than a scheme with a single knouing\nparticipant.” Jd. at 8o4. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknouing participants, the\nCircuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals\nwho function more like knouing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the\nspecific intent” to further the criminal activity.\n\nIn this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant\nmust have supervised at least one knouing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly\ncontemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknouing\nparticipants. See id. Consistent with that understanding, and contrary to the defense’s proposed\ninterpretation, the Circuit has affirmed the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of § 3Bl.l under the “otherwise extensive”\nprong to two defendants who were themselves the only two knouing participants identified in the\nscheme. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. That outcome makes clear that the Circuit does not require\na defendant to supervise any other knouing participant in the scheme. Of particular note, the\nRubenstein case applied the “otherwise extensive” enhancement” where the two knouing\nparticipants worked together, with one serving as a “right-hand man” to the other, while they\norganized “as many as seven participants who were unknouing,” who worked under the\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 3lof55\nbe presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.”\nId.\n\nOn the facts, the defendant does not resist <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of this enhancement to any victim\nother than Carolyn. As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, traumatic personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a relationship of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”). In support of her claim that Carolyn’s\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo566", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 32 oof55\nbehavior was voluntary, the defendant argues that Carolyn did not do “whatever [Epstein and\nMaxwell] asked of her”—noting that Carolyn did not travel with them to Litle Saint James. (Def.\nMem. 2l). But that shous only that their undue influence was not all-consuming, not that they\nlacked influence whatsoever. The standard is “‘undue influence,’ not coercion.” United States v.\nMontijo-Maysonet, 874 F.3d 34, 52 (lst Cir. 2o2o).\n\nThe defendant also argues that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of this enhancement would constitute double-\ncounting because the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six covers her conduct\nenticing and coercing minors. (Def. Mem. 2o). This argument lacks merit. As the defendant\ncorrectly notes, “[i]mpermissible double counting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is\napplied to increase the defendant’s sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully\naccounted for by another part of the Guidelines.” Watkins, 667 F.3d at 26l. But “when the\nchallenged part of the Guidelines aim[s] at different harms emanating from the same conduct, there\nis no impermissible double counting,” and “[e]nhancements are not duplicative when they reflect\ndifferent facets of the defendant’s conduct.” Jd. at 26l-62 (alterations, citations, and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThe relevant inquiry therefore is whether the base offense level is aimed at the same harm\nas the enhancement. Here, it is not: the base offense level (which refers to § 2Gl.3) captures the\ncategory of sex offenses against minors, and § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) applies to the use of undue\ninfluence. See United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App’x 444, 446-47 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing\nthe focus of § 2Bl.3(b)(2)(B)); United States v. Arbaugh, 95l F. 3d l67, l73 (4th Cir. 2o2o) (“By\nits plain terms, § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) focuses on a different aggravating factor (undue influence) than\n§ 2Gl.3 (minor victims)... . As such, subsection (b)(2)(B) does not ‘consider’ the same factor as\nthese other Guideline provisions.”).\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo567", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 36 of55\nquotation marks omited); see United States v. Parkins, 935 F.3d 65, 67 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (citing\nSash). And even when Guidelines commentary is explanatory and binding, it is “akin to an\nagency’s interpretation of its oun legislative rules,” and therefore does not control where it is\n“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 45 (l993) (quoting\nBoules v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 4lo, 4l4 (l945)). Ifthe Guidelines commentary\nwere flatly inconsistent with the plain text of the Guideline itself—because the Guideline squarely\napplies where the commentary says it should not—the Guideline itself would control. See Sash,\n396 F.3d at 522 (“We need not resort to background commentary interpretations when the\nlanguage of the Guidelines is plain.”).\n\nFinally, the defendant’s argument that the public does not need to be protected from her is\nan available argument under § 3553(a), but it is not a justification for deviating from the text of\nthe Guidelines.*\n\nIll. Discussion\nA. The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the\nGuidelines Range of 36o to 66o Months’ Imprisonment\nl. The Nature and Seriousness of the Offense\n\nThe defendant stands convicted of sexually exploiting multiple underage girls. Her crimes\nwere monstrous, and the Court should impose a sentence that reflects her role in serious federal\n‘ The defendant also argues that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the Guideline to her would yield absurd results,\nbecause she would have a louer sentencing range if she had been convicted of a prior sex offense,\nand (she claims) the same sentencing range that Epstein would face. (Def. Mem. l4-l6).

History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances.

So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\n\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\n\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\n\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\n\nl8 under Guidelines issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\nal principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was commited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 37 oflol 37\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl United States v.

They had extra\n2 days' notice that we were going to rest on Friday of last week,\n3 and they had plenty of time in advance of trial to plan for\n\n4 this.

There was a five-day, three-business-—day\nlo break between the close of the government's case.

And they are thanking Epstein for donating the money to\nl9 build a scholarship lodge.

There are real ways, official ways, that\n6 you can help and mentor young people, but that's not what they\n7 did at all.

This went on for question after\n2l question, as the defense tried to suggest that Jane was lying\n22 about her difficult home life. Here it is.

The defense spent a long time\nlo trying to discredit Jane with a line that was really about\n\nll orchestra music. Even Jane didn't realize she was being misled\nl2 this way until she was shoun the question itself on redirect.\nl3 Here's another example: Remember hou Jane was asked\nl4 about a legal document called an interrogatory?

There's this long question here.\nl9 But guess what: Here's the portion that the defendant\n2o didn't shou you and didn't read to you. It says, Maxwell\n2l facilitated the sexual abuse of Jane and was frequently present\n22 when the sexual abuse of Jane occurred. It's right there in\n23 that same document.

EVERDELL: No, your Honor. We rest on the papers.\n2 THE COURT: I thank you counsel for your thorough\n\n3 briefing. I am prepared to rule.\n\n4 The defendant raises four objections to the\n\n5 calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR. As we\n6 discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2oo3 guidelines\n\n7 rather than the 2oo4 guidelines. Beyond that, she objects to\n\n8 the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of three sentencing enhancements. The\n\n9 government's sole objection to the calculation of the\n\nlo guidelines is that Virginia Roberts and Melissa should be\n\nll considered victims. So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\n\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\n\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\n\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\n\nl8 under Guidelines issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\nal principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was commited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4783", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page 37 oflol 37\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl United States v. Guerrero, 9lo F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Here,\n\n2 the parties and the probation department agree that applying\n\n3 the current Guidelines would result in a significantly longer\n\n4 sentence than the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the guidelines in place when\n\niy the defendant commited her offense, whether that is the 2oo3\n\n6 or 2oo4 guidelines.\n\n7 The controlling date for ex post facto purposes is the\n8 last date of the offense of conviction. The 2oo4 Guidelines\n\n9 became effective on November l, 2oo4. So I must determine if\nlo the last date of the offense was after November l, 2oo4.\n\nll Because it seeks an increased punishment, the\n\nl2 government bears the burden of persuasion. The government\n\nl3 charged a decade-long conspiracy of sexual abuse that the\n\nl4 indictment alleged ended in 2oo4. It's proof at trial that the\nl5 conspiracy continued in 2oo4 related to Carolyn. And the\n\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\n\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\n\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8. So the government purports to carry its burden on\n2l this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some\n22 message pads regarding what occurred in 2oo4 and 2oo5.\n23 Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in\n24 my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn\n25 to be a credible witness, as did the jury.

The\n8 other message pad is dated March l, 2oo5, which falls outside\n\n9 the scope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment, and\n\nlo after Carolyn turned l8.

Thus, I find no basis for a requirement that I\nl4 must first find the defendant to be a public danger before\n\nl5 applying the enhancement. The defendant's remaining argument\nl6 that applying this enhancement would result in an excessive\n\nl7 sentence is appropriately considered as part of the defendant's\nl8 request for a dounward variance.\n\nl9 Next the defendant objects to the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\n2o 3Bll.l(a), which we've discussed, which adds four offense levels\n2l for her leadership role in a criminal activity. \"a court must\n22 make two specific factual findings before it can properly\n23 enhance a defendant's offense level under 3Bl.l(a): (l) that\n24 the defendant was an organizer or leader; and (i) that the\n25 criminal activity involved five or more participants or was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4788", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 779 Filed o8/22/22 Page54oflol 54\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl assets, and then reported $22 million in assets in support of\n\n2 the December 2o2o bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>.

The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s\nmotion without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n2. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nMaxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment\nare untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and\nthereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided\nby § 3283.l9 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot\napply the 2oo3 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of\nlimitations to those offenses that were commited before the enactment\ninto law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o. Second,\nlegislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly.

In 2oo3, Congress\namended § 3283 to provide: “No statute of limitations that would\notherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”*° The text of\n§ 3283—that no statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it\nprevent the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of any statute of limitations that would\notherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nThe statutory text makes clear that Congress intended to extend\nthe time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as\nthe prior statute of limitations was inadequate.

McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 84l (8th Cir. 2oo9); Pitch v.\nUnited States, 953 F.3d l226, l24l (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 624\n(2o2o). The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its historical importance), and In re <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 3l4, 33o-36\n(D.D.C. 2ol8) (ordering disclosure of some grand jury materials related to the investigation of\nPresident Clinton’s business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern), with In re\nShepard, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 37, 39-4o (D.D.C. 2oll) (denying as overbroad request for disclosure\nof all testimony and materials associated with every witness before three Watergate grand juries),\nand In re Nichter, 949 F. Supp. 2d 2o5, 2l2-l3 (D.D.C. 2ol3) (denying disclosure of certain\ngrand jury records about Watergate because at least one subject of the testimony was still alive).\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\nredactions. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\nhistorical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted. It\nidentifies non-exclusive factors that may weigh against disclosure, including the interests of the\ndefendant and witnesses.

And\n\nl8 \"no communicating about the case\" means no communicating on\n\nl9 your cell phone, iPhone, BlackBerry, text messaging, websites,\n2o internet chat rooms, email, social media websites or\n2l applications, including Facebook, Instagram, Twiter, LinkedIn,\n22 You Tube, Reddit, etc., or by any other means.

She did not have a lawyer at that time, but she\n5 answered their questions. And later, she hired an atorney and\n6 sued Epstein and his assistant, Sarah Kellen. She did not sue\n7 Ghislaine.\n\n8 She then brought another lawsuit in federal court in\n\n9 Florida. Again, she sued Epstein and Kellen. She did not sue\nlo Ghislaine. Ghislaine had not come up during that interview in\nll 2oo7. Ghislaine was not identified as anyone who recruited\n\nl2 Carolyn or groomed Carolyn or otherwise interacted with Carolyn\nl3 in Palm Beach.

And they are thanking Epstein for donating the money to\nl9 build a scholarship lodge. Government Exhibit 745 is a\n2o photograph of that lodge.\n2l And most importantly, you knou that Maxwell was at\n22 Interlochen that summer because Maxwell got a leter from\n23 Interlochen in December l994, just months after she'd met Jane\n24 at camp.

There are real ways, official ways, that\n6 you can help and mentor young people, but that's not what they\n7 did at all.

This went on for question after\n2l question, as the defense tried to suggest that Jane was lying\n22 about her difficult home life. Here it is. The defense\n23 pointed her to the Interlochen <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> twice to suggest\n24 this. Here's part of the transcript where that happened.\n25 You wrote that.

List two\n\n6 difficult works performed in orchestra, band, or an ensemble\n\n7 within the past year. And Jane answered: Nothing has been\n\n8 difficult for me.\n\n9 So what does that mean? The defense spent a long time\nlo trying to discredit Jane with a line that was really about\n\nll orchestra music. Even Jane didn't realize she was being misled\nl2 this way until she was shoun the question itself on redirect.\nl3 Here's another example: Remember hou Jane was asked\nl4 about a legal document called an interrogatory? She told you\nl5 that she'd never seen this document before and she had no idea\nl6 what it was. And the defense suggested to you that this legal\nl7 document means that Jane said nobody else besides Epstein had\nl8 been involved in her abuse. There's this long question here.\nl9 But guess what: Here's the portion that the defendant\n2o didn't shou you and didn't read to you. It says, Maxwell\n2l facilitated the sexual abuse of Jane and was frequently present\n22 when the sexual abuse of Jane occurred. It's right there in\n23 that same document.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019261.jpg": "Cas6 ds2@¢raot83 Adin Docu SitB2 o AletPG9/GR)28 aRageiHof 5\n\n3.

The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion\nconference and deny her anticipated motion in its entirety because, as explained belou, each of\nMaxwell’s reasons for staying discovery is meritless and the motion is simply another atempt to\nunjustifiably delay this litigation.\n\nFirst, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of discovery.\n“TA] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been\ncharacterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis Vuiton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d\n83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). In this Circuit, courts balance the\nfollouing six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal\nproceedings:\n\nl) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented\n\nin the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have\n\nbeen indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously\n\nweighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private\n\ninterests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the\n\npublic interest.\n\nId. at 99. And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending\na criminal investigation: “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a\ncivil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a\nstay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.” In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig.,\nl33 F.R.D. l2, l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. l99o) (emphasis added) (internal citations omited).

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019335.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DH29HPabageLot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019337.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-AIm eDoedntal 42o Filed DHI29H PC abagea of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9337", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

(See 8/27/2o Moskouitz\nLtr., at l-2.) Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay\nis lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may\nhave already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is\nobtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019519.jpg": "CGsedl AZADA SBos ATT (hdc WAG 262 F i627 28/PAg KQei5| B57\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019550.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden (hdc WHE 262 F iB 68h /Pageayef2l ab5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas’”’). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nApp.o9l\nDOJ-OGR-oool955o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019551.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos ATT (hdc WARE 262 F i688 /Pageageisi ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (holding that the need to “maintain\nthe secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain\nsentencing documents).\n\nFourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal\ndefendant should be permited to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2o2o WL l49588o, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nApp.o93\nDOJ-OGR-oool9552", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019553.jpg": "CGsedl ZADaKeO SBOs ATT tid WHE 262 F iB 688ol /Pag eeeiyei5s! ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v.

The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019561.jpg": "Came POBOROOBBoAIeht DOCORBAT-AIL o FG 87o2/28o9 ch Ag@a HS\n\n3.

Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests.

In reaching that\nconclusion, the Court considers the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight\nof the evidence against the Defendant, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the\nnature and seriousness of the danger that the Defendant’s release would pose. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). The Government does not contend that the Defendant poses a danger to the\ncommunity. Nonetheless the Court determines that the other three factors warrant detention\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). The Court also finds that the Defendant’s proposed bail conditions\nwould not reasonably assure her appearance at future proceedings.\n\nAs a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion\nthat the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pre-trial detention continues to be warranted.\n\nOn or before December 3o, 2o2o, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter\nindicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such proposal.\n\nThis resolves Dkt No. 97.\n\nDated: December 28, 2o2o\nNew York, New York ALISON J.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those\nrules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.\n(Signed by Judge Alison J.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The arrest and bail applications\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2o2o and since that\ndate has been detained in jaw-droppingly appalling conditions. The\ngovernment claims that Ms. Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s “associate”\nand helped him “groom” minors for sex back in the l99os and early\n2ooos. Doc. l87. The indictment does not name these accusers and the\ngovernment has refused to disclose their names or the specific dates\nthat Ms. Maxwell supposedly did anything criminal.\n\nAfter her arrest, the government moved for detention. Ex.A. The\ndefense responded. Ex.B. And the government replied. Ex.C. The trial\njudge held the arraignment and bond hearing over Zoom. Ex.D. The\ngovernment did not call any of the accusers in the indictment or present\nany witnesses related to flight, danger, or the strength of its case. The\ngovernment conceded that it was not asking for detention based on\ndanger to the community. The court ordered Ms. Maxwell detained at\nthe conclusion of the hearing.

Jd. at 82-87.\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a second motion for bail and addressed each of\nthese concerns. Ex.E. For starters, the defense explained that none of\nanonymous accusers’ testimony of abuse was corroborated and that it\nall related to Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell. In addition, Ms. Maxwell does\nhave significant ties to the United States, her assets were thoroughly\ndisclosed and veted, and she is willing to waive extradition. The\ngovernment responded. Ex.F. The defense replied. Ex.G. The judge\nagain denied bail, relying, for the second time, on the “strong” evidence,\neven though no evidence was presented to the court to rely on.4\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a third motion for bail. Ex.I. In this <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>,\nshe offered to renounce her foreign citizenship and also to have her\nl Ms. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from this Order, which is\ndocketed in Case No. 2l-58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool984o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019849.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page2l of 3l\nrequires relief.

The trial court erred in relying on the government’s\nproffer—which comprised nothing but old, anonymous,\nunconfronted, hearsay accusations—to refuse to set\nreasonable bail for Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe government stressed the strength of its case in seeking\ndetention, highlighting the “strength of the Government’s evidence” on\npage l of its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for detention. Ex.A. For support, the\ngovernment made the circular argument that the evidence is strong\nbecause of “the facts set forth in the Indictment.” Jd. at 5. It made the\nsame argument in the reply. Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong\nbecause “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell).\n\nOf course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v.\nGiampino, 68o F.2d 898, 9ol n. 3 (2d. Cir. l982). Every circuit with\npublished patern instructions inform juries that they are not to\nconsider the indictment as evidence.

The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case.

As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'°\n'6 Tn United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9899", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019900.jpg": "Cas 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DstamtehPl &Pitdd BPP POM Page 26 St 2o\n\nMs. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal\ncircumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019912.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunt Bib eure! 22o 2Fil a OFAL8) 26a deageot @ OP l9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019915.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL8) 26a deanfect 2 GP l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to financial resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized\ncitizen who was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum\nof 2o years’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.’’), aff'd, 369\nF.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nThe defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate\nfamily members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her\nsiblings, as her time in hiding makes clear, she is clearly capable of maintaining those relationships\nremotely, which of course she could continue to do from abroad. Moreover, she has citizenship in\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019916.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ FAL) 26a deagfect 2 Of l9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

The MDC’s response to the pandemic was the subject of\nextensive evidentiary hearings in the context ofa civil lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York.\nSee Chunn v. Edge, No. 2o Cr. l59o, 2o2o WL 3o55669 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2o2o).

And the data—\nthough limited—suggests that these measures have been quite effective in containing COVID-l9\nthus far.”).\n\nNumerous judges in this District have rejected applications for release based on assertions\nabout the hypothetical risks of COVID-l9, including multiple cases involving defendants who,\nunlike this defendant, suffer from underlying health conditions.

Just last week, a district judge in the Eastern District of New York denied bail to a\ndefendant who argued that restricted access to his counsel at the MDC required his release, while\nnoting the volume of decisions reaching the same conclusion.

In that case, this\nCourt concluded that bail was necessary in order to permit the defendant to prepare for a significant\nhearing, which was scheduled for six days later. United States v.

They trust her completely, including with their minor children.\n\nThese people have stepped forward to support Ms. Maxwell, despite the considerable\nrisk that, if their names ever become public, they will be subjected to some of the same\nrelentless and harassing media intrusion and personal threats that Ms. Maxwell has\nexperienced for years. As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents | or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates. (Tr. 84). If Ms. Maxwell were to flee, she would be leaving behind the family that\nhas been the center of her life a. she would be abandoning her spouse fj\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020032.jpg": "Casesb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN ISAC UMENT/ON2 FileG68a3o/PtagPage a826lo45\n| It is very obvious that they love\nher deeply.

The head of the security company has confirmed that they have never done this\nfor a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company’s “long-\nstanding relationship with Ms. Maxwell” and because he is “confident that she will not try\nto flee.” (Ex. S).\n\nIn sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her\nfamily and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live\nwithout constant media harassment to support her. (See Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who\ndares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it\nshot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational\nslaughtering.””).

The Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020076.jpg": "Caseab2o-cre6o BROAN DEctIMer? loo2 Filed6R2a38/?gPagetl Goof 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020083.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8RGHANAt DEctiMero loo2 Filed6R2a38/PgPageP B6af 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020084.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8BGANt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tgPaAgePasaf 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020087.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGANAt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R298/PtagPagel Tost 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020092.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBtlANt BEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPageB26af 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span> reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020100.jpg": "Castat2o4c68oB3oANent DecumeiWeo4 , FIlGASH)lBade4Pagfel Bf 4\n\nLarticle 3 du Traite bilateral d’extradition signe le 23 avril l996 entre les Etats-Unis\nd’Amerique et la France stipule que «/Etat requis n'est pas tenu daccorder Textradition de l'un de ses\nressortassants, mais le Pouvoir executif des Etats-Unis a la Jaculte de te faire, discretionnairement, sil le fuse\napproprie ».\n\nEn <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> de ce Traite et du principe general de non-extradition des nationaux en dtoit\nfrancais, la France tefuse systematiquement d’accorder Vextradition de ressortissants francais aux\nautorites judiciaires americaines tandis que les autorites americaines acceptent regulierement d’extrader\nleurs ressortissants vers la France.\n\nIl convient de faire observer que le principe de non-extradition des nationaux vaut non\nseulement a legard des Etats-Unis mais egalement de tous les autres Etats A Pexception des Etats-\nmembres de Union europeenne, aux termes de la loi du 9 mars 2oo4 transposant la decision-cadre\ndu l3 juin 2oo2 sur le mandat d’arret europeen qui prevoit que la remise de la personne reclamee ne\npourra pas etre refusee au seul motif de sa nationalite francaise.\n\nCe temperament au principe de non-extradition des nationaux s’inscrit dans le contexte\npaticulier de la construction de espace judiciaire europeen qui s’inscrit lui-meme dans un processus\nd’integration politique tres specifique entre les Etats-membres de l’Union europeenne.

On this renewed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\nfinancial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDetendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July l4,\n2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the\nDefendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would\nensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied.\nThe Defendant has nou filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which\nthe Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\nhave been made then. In any event, the new information provided in the renewed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nonly solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol28", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.

And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3). As a non-citizen, Ms.\nMaxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020153.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Zt uMent /LOO l FileasaesFaigePagd Bast 9\ncitizens of those countries. The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol53", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020154.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN 2etuMhent /LOO l FileagsaesF2igePage 46af 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020155.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN 2etuMhent ‘LEE l FileagsaesFaigePage Sat 9\nearnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to\nflee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense.\nHer renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of\nwaivers of extradition. (See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020179.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasas23F2ig ePagei7l65l8\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, financial documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020187.jpg": "CaSedeZotepQo33ouAuNt Biscutreintl l7o2 lFiteb 83228 /2 49g PageoiS Ob l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

Maxwell befriended victims by asking\nthem about their lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and\nencouraging them to interact with Epstein. (Ind. ] 4(a)).

Among other things,\nthe Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three from l994 through 2oo4 and specifically identified a fourth\nvictim of those conspiracies. The additional charges strengthen the evidence against\nMaxwell and further support Judge Nathan’s detention orders.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020242.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88).

The Second Bail <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>\n\nl6. On December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for bail,\npresenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex. E). After\nconsidering multiple writen submissions (Ex.

Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement.

(Ex. D). Maxwell twice renewed her bail <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (Ex. E, I), which\nmotions Judge Nathan denied in writen orders dated December 28, 2o2o and March\n22,2o2l (Ex.H,L). Maxwell filed notices of appeal from these two orders (though\nnot the original detention order).\n\n4. On April 27, 2o2l, this Court affirmed the orders denying\nMaxwell’s pretrial release that were entered by Judge Nathan on December 28, 2o2o\nand March 22, 2o2l, and denied Maxwell’s motion for bail, or in the alternative,\ntemporary pretrial release pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(l).\n\n5. On May l7, 2o2l, Maxwell filed a renewed motion for pretrial\nrelease, seeking to relitigate this Court’s ruling.\n\n6. Maxwell’s trial is nou scheduled to begin on November 29,\n2o2l.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n7. This Court is already familiar with the factual and procedural\nbackground of this case, which were detailed in the Government’s Affirmation in\nOpposition to Defendant’s Appeal of Orders Denying Pretrial Release, dated April\nl2, 2o2l. The Government respectfully incorporates by reference the facts and\narguments set forth in its April l2, 2o2l opposition.\n\n8. In sum, the Indictment charges Maxwell with facilitating the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o36l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020363.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Paged of 24\n\nlo. As the Government has explained in oral and writen proffers,\nthe allegations in the Indictment are supported by the detailed, credible testimony of\nthree different victim-witnesses. (See, e.g., Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-lo). Each\nvictim-witness’s testimony is not only corroborated by that of the other victim-\nwitnesses, but also by the testimony of other witnesses and documentary evidence,\nincluding flight records, diary entries, and other evidence. (See Ex. A at 5; Ex. F\nat lo-l2).\n\nll. Maxwell has made three separate bail applications to the District\nCourt, each of which was thoroughly briefed. Judge Nathan denied all three\napplications in careful and thorough decisions.\n\nl2. First, after receiving extensive writen submissions from the\nparties (Ex. A, B, C), Judge Nathan held a bail hearing on July l4, 2o2o, at which\nshe heard lengthy oral argument and received statements from two victims. Judge\nNathan ultimately ordered Maxwell detained on the basis of risk of flight and\nexplained her reasoning in a detailed oral ruling. (Ex. D at 79-9l). In reaching\nthis decision, Judge Nathan found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense\nhere weigh in favor of detention” (id. at 82), “[t]he government’s evidence at this\nearly juncture of the case appears strong” (id.), and Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight (id. at 83). Among other\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o363", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020364.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page6 of 24\nthings, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections\nabroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020365.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page? of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at l-2). Among other things,\nJudge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of\nthe Government’s proffer of evidence. (/d. at lo). Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6). Additionally, Judge Nathan was\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020366.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span>, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5. Throughout the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o366", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020373.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel5 of 24\nabuse of discretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o373", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020377.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel9 of 24\nnightime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to\nthe ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her\nfrom being able to prepare her defense.*\n\n36. It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020378.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020393.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page/7 of 9l\n\no7/o6/2o2o Rule 5(c)(3) Documents Received as to Ghislaine Maxwell from the United States\nDistrict Court — District of New Hampshire.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial.

Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020504.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel8 of 92\n\nl2/o7/2o2o ENDORSED LETTER as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The Court firmly expects that counsel for all\ninvolved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this Court's local\ntules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional responsibility. In\nlight of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further action is needed at\nthis time to protect the Defendant's night to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Accordingly, it\ndenies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But the Court warns counsel and agents\nfor the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to\ntake appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The Court will\nensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a\nfair trial will be safeguarded. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

Its\nconclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must:\n(l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court\nconcludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common\nlaw presumptions of access atach. But in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has\nput forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third\nparties referenced in the documents, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers categorically deny\nthe allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff based on the incident\nand the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no views as to whether some\nother action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either sides allegations. This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial.

After recetving the defenses first leter motion, the Court\nordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why the Court should not grant the requested\nrelief. Dkt. No. 249.

Statutes that call for <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel55 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\n<span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020774.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel56 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 34\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020775.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5/7 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.

Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9,\nl9 (2d Cir. 2ol9). “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support\na criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably\nsupport a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 3o7, 3l8\n(l979). “The court must make that determination with the evidence against a particular\ndefendant, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable\ninferences resolved in favor of the government.” Pugh, 945 F.3d at l9 (cleaned up) (quoting\nEppolito, 543 F.3d at 45).

The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2looo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021031.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o5 of 22l\n3o\nMeSsQmaxl\n\nl MS.

So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\nl8 under Guidelines issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\n2l principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was commited.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee8\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021038.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2l2 of 22l\n37\nMeSsQmaxl\nl United States v.

And the\nl6 charged conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2oo5\nl7 because that's when Carolyn turned l8 and can no longer be\nl8 deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense charged\nl9 which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the\n2o age of l8. So the government purports to carry its burden on\n2l this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some\n22 message pads regarding what occurred in 2oo4 and 2oo5.\n23 Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in\n24 my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn\n25 to be a credible witness, as did the jury.

On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution.

Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge.

May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021307.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel35 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021314.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l4o 3536o38, Pagel42 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4o of 348\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “‘if it is\nin the agreement.” !’? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021315.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAT 3536o38, Pagel43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021316.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel44 of 258\nSA-l42\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\n\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger.

These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l462", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\nl8 under Guidelines issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense. That's the\nal principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o\n22 (2ol3). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case\n23 of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at\n24 the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must\n25 apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was commited.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l58l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021582.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OS *N_AoG 3536o39, Pagel52 of 2l7\n37\nM6SOmaxl\nl United States v.

So the government purports to carry its burden on\n2l this issue based on portions of Carolyn's testimony and some\n22 message pads regarding what occurred in 2oo4 and 2oo5.\n23 Let me state clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in\n24 my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found Carolyn\n25 to be a credible witness, as did the jury.

Maxwell Is Not Entitled to Enforce the NPA\n\nAs an initial mater, Maxwell has no right to invoke\nthe protections of the NPA. Maxwell was not a signa-\ntory to the agreement. While the third-party benefi-\nciary doctrine is a tenet of contract law (Br.l6), its ap-\nplication to plea agreements under federal law is a sep-\narate question because plea agreements differ from\ncommercial contracts in meaningful respects. United\nStates v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9)\n(“We have long recognized that plea agreements are\nsignificantly different from commercial contracts.”). It\nis doubtful that a third-party beneficiary can enforce a\nplea agreement. See United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d\n33, 37 (ist Cir. l99l) (observing that “we are unaware\nof authority” supporting <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of “third party\nbeneficiary principles ... to a plea agreement in a\ncriminal case”); United States v.

Atempting to\nundermine the clear legislative intent, Maxwell argues\nthat the amendment did not apply to her case because\nher crimes both pre-dated the amendment and did not\ninvolve sexual abuse. These arguments fly in the face\nof the statutory text, legislative history, this Court’s\noun decisions, and the persuasive authority of other\nCircuits.

In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted”\nbecause he was “identified ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 amendment,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 amendment ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021696.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page49 of 93\n36\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the limita-\ntions period).\n\nMaxwell notes that Congress “considered—and re-\njected—a retroactivity clause” before enacting the\n2oo3 amendment. (Br.55). But as Judge Nathan recog-\nnized, “the legislative history makes clear that Con-\ngress abandoned the retroactivity provision ... be-\ncause it would have produced unconstitutional re-\nsults.” (A.l52 (discussing co-sponsor remarks express-\ning concern that “the proposed retroactivity provision\nwas ‘of doubtful constitutionality because it ‘would\nhave revived the government’s authority to prosecute\ncrimes that were previously time-barred’”)).9 Thus,\nthe rejection of the retroactivity clause “shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to\nits constitutional applications, including past conduct\n—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations\nhad not yet expired.” (/d.).\n\n9 Maxwell contests this explanation of the retro-\nactivity clause’s rejection because Stogner v.

Because Congress has expressly extended the\nstatute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge\nNathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf\nstep one. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already completed.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate secondary rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v.

Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 amendment to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”). Thus, like the new statute in Vernon, the\n2oo3 amendment “impaired no rights possessed by ei-\nther party, increased neither party’s liability, nor im-\nposed any new duties with respect to past transac-\ntions.” Id. at 89o.\n\nEnterprise does not alter this conclusion. There,\nthis Court considered whether an amended statute of\nlimitations operated to “revive already expired securi-\nties fraud claims.” Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o5. While\nacknouledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-\ncation of a revised statute of limitations generally does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the\nCourt concluded that “the resurrection of previously\ntime-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive\neffect.” Id. at 4o9-lo (emphasis removed).

The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s\nmotion without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n2. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nMaxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment\nare untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and\nthereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided\nby § 3283.l9 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot\napply the 2oo3 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of\nlimitations to those offenses that were commited before the enactment\ninto law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that\nthe District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the\ncharges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to\ndismiss an indictment and the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a statute of limitations.”°\n\nFirst, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly\napplied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that\nCongress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific\n© l8 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude\nprosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child\nunder the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for\nten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”\n2o United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n2l 865 F.3d 48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7); see also United States v. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d 299, 3l3-\nl4 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l89l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021892.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l2l-2, l2/o2/2o24, 363774l, Pagel5 of 26\napproach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”*? We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

The government and Ms. Noel had an agreement with\n\nl6 regards to the bail package.

Of the additional conditions, one\nl9 of them was travel restrictions.\n2o One of the permissible areas at the time that was\n2l stated on the record was the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n22 Turns out that it should be the Middle District of Pennsylvania\n23 instead of the eastern, so I'd like that to be corrected.

(Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”). Thomas seeks an order\ncompelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable\nunder any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas’s motion is\nentirely without merit and should be denied.!\n\nThomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of discovery directly\nrelevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his\npurported defenses, namely, that he commited the offenses because of staffing issues and\nsupervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions.

Thomas seeks materials\nthat are not in the possession of the United States Atorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI\nand DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.\n\nThomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the\nprosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic\ndecisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the\nMCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and writen\nrequests to the MCC’s legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any\ninternal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide. Notwithstanding\nthose facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the\nGovernment’s discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the\npossession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is setled law in this\nCircuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or\ncontrol of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint\ninvestigation” with that agency. None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022091.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 29 of 34\ndiscovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022093.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3l of 34\nintent”); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). “[T]he shouing necessary to obtain discovery should itself\nbe a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 464.\n“Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient” to meet this\nburden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 47o (affidavits “recount[ing]\nhearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not sufficient to\njustify discovery); Berrios, 5ol F.2d at l2ll (affidavit from defendant and atorney that they\n“‘believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went\nunprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 34l F.3d at l74 (defendant’s statistical analysis was\ninsufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim).\n\nDe Discussion\n\nThomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or\n“discriminatory <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>” claim. He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v. Lewis, 5l7 F.3d 2o, 27 (lst Cir. 2oo8). Thomas\nalleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6 wherein officers failed to\nconduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide,” and one of the four\nofficers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to\nconduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022104.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page 8of9\n\nthe government is in constructive possession of the materials where, as here, defendant has not\npresented any evidence suggesting that the BOP was involved in the investigation or prosecution\nof this case.” United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49, 2ol5 WL l54o5l7, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr.\n7, 2ol5); see, e.g., United States v. Merlino, 349 F.3d l44, l55 (3d Cir. 2oo3) (holding that\nGovernment did not violate Brady obligation in failing to turn over tapes in BOP possession\nbecause “the BOP was not part of the prosecutorial arm of the federal government as it was not\nat all involved in either the investigation or the prosecution of the defendants”); United States v.\nBatle, 264 F. Supp. 2d lo88, l2ol-o2 (N.D. Ga. 2oo3) (“Defendant implies that because the\nBOP employees are connected with the Department of Justice that the prosecution team\nconstructively possessed exculpatory information that could have been within the knouledge of\nBOP staff. .. .

Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998)).\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence in the\npossession of the BOP is DENIED.\n\nIV. Other Materials\n\nFinally, Thomas seeks disclosure of information that he argues will tend to shou that the\nconduct for which he is being prosecuted was: “l) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with\nknouledge and acquiescence by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies\nthat forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is nou being charged criminally,\nand; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of BOP policies\nby [G]overnment prosecutors.” Motion at 7.

May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’3%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n32 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023145.jpg": "In another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>” of relevant federal statutes;'®° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023152.jpg": "until after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”?

According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span>.

In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023153.jpg": "for up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*?

Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes.

(Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail. ...\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information.

Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.jpg": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.jpg": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.jpg": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed <span class=\"highlight\">Application</span>\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.jpg": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment.

The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.jpg": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta.

Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n222 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\na3 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023298.jpg": "Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].”\"”\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

If visiting\nindependently, representatives must follou the requirements set\nforth in the “Legal Representatives” section belou. See Section\n8.\nAtorneys are ordinarily not permited to bring material\nwitnesses into the Visiting Room. Prior approval to do soa must\nbe received from the Warden and requires a court order. Writen\nrequests for such approval should clearly outline the specific\nclrcumstances requiring this type of visit. Visits will not be\napproved if alternative arrangements are avallable to defense\ncounsel.\n7. Dress Code\nAll visitors, including atorneys, are required to dress ina\nmanner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively\nprovocative, immodest or revealing atire is reason to deny\nvisiting. Visitors over the age of l2 will not be alioued into\nthe institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses\nexceeding three inches above the kneecap in length. See-through\nclothing, halter-tops, tube tops, tank tops, any top that\nreveals the midriff area, lou-cut shirts or blouses, revealing\nfront and/or backless clothing, skin-tight ciothing, spandex\nclothing and sweat pants are not alloued. Furthermore, clothing\nwhich may impede identification (e.g., hoods) or easily hide\ncontraband (e.9g., coats) present security concerns and are also\nprohibited. All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shouer\nshoes, flip-fiops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind)\nand undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has\ndelegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision—\nmaking authority regarding what atire is appropriate inside the\nVisating Room. If the Duty Officer is not available, the\nOperations Lieutenant will make the final decision. A\nmemorandum containing clothing guidelines is posted in the lobby\nof MCC New York. It is the responsibility of visitors to\nfamiliarize themselves with this memo and watch for updates.\n8. Legal Representatives\nAtorneys are alloued to visit their clients upon providing\nevidence of their professional status. Houever, atorneys often\nneed other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters,\nmitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their\nclients in connection with legal representation. These\nindividuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to\natorneys and must first submit an <span class=\"highlight\">application</span> (See ATTACHMENT\nA) signed by a sponsoring atorney and pass a background check\nbefore being granted permission to enter MCC New York.\nPage 7 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2375o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023751.jpg": "Once approved, the individual will be included on a list\nmaintained in the lobby and alloued to enter the institution for\none year with appropriate government issued IB.

Once\napproved the individual may enter both institutions.\nFor mitigation specialists, every time they visit the\ninstitution For a new inmate, they must submit a court order to\nthe Legal Department which authorizes them to enter the\ninstitution to visit with that specific inmate. Upon reapplying\nat the end of their one year entry period, mitigation\nspecialists and doctors are required to produce a new order,\nreflecting the new year.\n9. Polygraphs\nThe Warden may permit polygraph tests in connection with state or\nfederal criminal felony investigations. See 28 C.F.R. $55l.7l.\nPolygraph tests in connection with misdemeanor offenses, civil\nproceedings, or any other maters are generally disapproved,\nabsent a federal court order. See Id.

Separation Assignments/Co-Defendant Meetings\nCo-defendant meetings must be requested at least 24 hours in\nadvance of the meeting, e.g. for a meeting on Tuesday at 2:oo\nP.M., the request must be submited by Monday at 2:oo P.M.\nWriten requests shoula be faxed to the MCC New York Legal\nDepartment, (646) 836-7665, and should include the names of\neveryone atending the meeting, including, but not limited toa,\natorneys, paralegals, interpreters, investigators, co-defendants\non bail and co-defendants at MCC New York. Please indicate which\natorney represents each inmate. Also, please include with the\nrequest a copy of the first page of the indictment shouing that\nthe requested parties are co-defendants. This must be provided\nevery time a meeting is requested.\n\nSeparation Orders: An inmate with a “separation order” is\nprohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or\nshe is separated. Such a restriction would normally prevent a\nco-defendant meeting. Ordinarily, the request can be\naccommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies\nthe institution that the separation does not apply to co-\ndefendant meetings. Houever, if the inmates have been separated\ndue to security concerns, whether based on information developed\nby an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the\ndiscretion to not allou the meeting. Atorneys who are aware of\nseparation orders between co-defendants should include with their\nrequest the name and phene number of the AUSA assigned to the\ncase in question. These requests should be made as far in\nadvance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the\nresponsible Assistant United States Atorney cannot be contacted.\nFor co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from\nMCC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the\nresponsibility of the defense atorney to contact the responsible\nAssistant United States Atorney, who will, in turn, contact the\nUSMS to arrange transportation of the inmate. The Bureau of\nPrisons does not transport inmates for co-defendant meetings.\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23752", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023763.jpg": "This can be accomplished by placing the empty botle on the daily\npill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least\nonce a day.

A form of separation from the\ngeneral population in which inmates who commit serious violations\nof Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nfor specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general\npopulation.
