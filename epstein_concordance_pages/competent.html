Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Third stage: Arrest and presentation before the Prosecutor General (beginning of\nthe judicial phase)\nl4. Any person arrested pursuant to an extradition application must be transferred to the\nterritorially <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> Prosecutor General within 48 hours after the arrest®.\nl5.

Fourth stage: Decision of the Investigating Chamber of the <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> Court of\n\nappeal\n\nl8. Once the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General whether he consents\nor not to extradition, the Investigating Chamber is immediately seized of the case. This\nphase varies depending on whether the requested person consents to extradition.\n\nl9. If the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General that he or she consents to\nextradition, Article 696-l3 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides that he\nor she must appear before the Investigating Chamber within 5 working days from the\ndate of presentation before the Prosecutor General. The same provision states that the\nrequested person may also decide to waive the rule of specialty before the Prosecutor\nGeneral.\n\n2o. If, at this appearance, the requested person confirms his or her consent to be extradited\nand the legal conditions for extradition are fulfilled, the Investigating Chamber informs\nthe person of the legal consequences of such consent and formally acknouledges this\nconsent within 7 days from the date of appearance, unless additional investigations have\nbeen ordered’,\n\n2l. The rules of this simplified extradition procedure must be read in light of Article ll of\nthe Agreement on Extradition between the European Union and the USA of 25 June\n2oo3 (“Simplified extradition procedures”), which states that “if the person sought\nconsents to be surrendered to the requesting State, the requested State may, in\naccordance with the principles and procedures provided for under its legal system,\nsurrender the person as expeditiously as possible without further proceedings. The\nconsent of the person sought may include agreement to waiver of protection of the rule\nof specialty”!°.

Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\nprosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the\nFrench government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all\nthe relevant facts were commited in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also\nlocated in the USA.\n\n79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition\nrequest, it would be difficult for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to\ndeny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”\n\n8o. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American nationality, and has\nsubstantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French\ngovernment as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.\n\n8l. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding\nWaiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail\nconditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive\nnot to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French nationality as a ban to\nextradition.\n\nWilliam Julie\n37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 2o\nyears, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases.

Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate.

Dr. Dietz is not remotely <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case.

See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case.

So rates of disclosure kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 disclosure is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays disclosure have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of childhood sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed disclosure in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why disclosure of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span>.

None of the government’s\narguments is well taken, houever, if only because, “as with an expert’s qualifications and the\nreliability of his or her methodology, the liberality of Rule 7o2 insists that ‘doubts about whether\nan expert’s testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless\nthere are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.’” Washington v. Kellwood\nCo., lo5 F. Supp. 3d 293, 3o8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (quoting Jn re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., 489 F.\nSupp. 2d 23o, 288 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo7)).\n\nC. Excluding Dr. Hall’s expert opinions would deprive Ms. Maxwell of her\n\nconstitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense.\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).

A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009268.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEum Butler G4 Fileddz/24/22agePage 426 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.

Moon, 7l8 F.2d\nl2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)). Mere “[g]ossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4). Rather, “[a]llegations of\nimpropriety must be ‘concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> and\nrelevant evidence.’” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o (quoting United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o,\n543 (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe Defendant argues that this is the wrong standard. Maxwell Reply, Feb. 9, 2o22, at 8\nn.4. But the Defendant does not identify an alternative standard. And the Second Circuit has\napplied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough\nhearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). As the\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly warned, “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences:\nsubjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, ll9-2o (l987) (citing\nMcDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267-68 (l9l5)). And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to\nafford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o6 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nThe Defendant argues that the considerations in Tanner and Janniello are inapplicable to\nher motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9547\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo983o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad discretion.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009947.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN RTE COA.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-l426\nDear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe,\n\nIam appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell. I was not trial counsel\nfor Ms. Maxwell. I filed an Acknouledgement and Notice of Appearance on July l5, 2o22. The\nClerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any\ninformation concerning the transcripts.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), the ready date for this case was July l5, 2o22.\nAccordingly, I have until July 29, 2o22, to file this briefing schedule request. Pursuant to Local\nRule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), I can request no more than 9l days from the ready date as the deadline for\nfiling Appellant’s Brief. That date would be October l4, 2o22.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(D), houever, I am permited to request a later deadline\nto file Appellant’s Brief ifthe case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.\nI request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 3o, 2o23, for the\nfollouing reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions identified by the rule. First, as noted,\nI am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week. As\nnew counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to\nprovide my client with the most <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> and effective representation on appeal. Second, the\nrecord is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of transcript including pretrial hearings,\nvoir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists\nof 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in\nlimine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct\nmy oun research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance\nof prevailing on appeal. This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size\nof Appellant’s Brief.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span> representation to a client.?°\n<span class=\"highlight\">Competent</span> representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide <span class=\"highlight\">competent</span>, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021530.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pageloo of 2l7\nSA-354\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 6 of 2l\nBaker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v.

Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time\nincluding a high profile case with extensive media atention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court\nproceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this\nwriter that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.\nDespite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly\ndenied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his\natorney, to take a shouer, and to brush his teeth.

The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable.
