Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag. Tr.” refers to the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2ol9;\n“T).

Background\nThis ruling follous the Court’s bail hearing held on July l5, 2ol9. The issue before the\nCourt is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or\n| whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\nconsideration of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. See <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span>, dated July 8, 2ol9\n(“7/8/l9 Tr.’’), at 2-3; <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span>, dated July l5, 2ol9 (7/l5/l9 Tr.”), at 4o. It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000490.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page l9 of 33\n(“Jeffrey Epstein never once checked in with City cops in eight-plus years since a Manhatan :\njudge ordered him to do so every 9o days”).\nMr. Epstein is a Level II sex offender in New York State which is the highest category\nof risk to reoffend. This designation requires that Mr. Epstein report his presence in New York to |\nlaw enforcement authorities every 9o days. As discussed at the July l5, 2ol9 bail hearing, .\ncounsel for Mr. Epstein made an application in New York State Supreme Court in 2oll to |\nreduce Epstein’s sex offender registration status from Level III to Level I. If granted, this\nreduction would have alloued Mr. Epstein to avoid his reporting obligations. In a Sex Offender |\nRegistration Act Hearing on January ll, 2ol8, held before the Honorable Ruth Pickholz, Mr. |\nEpstein’s application was (firmly) denied, principally because it had been established by the |\nBoard of Examiners of Sex Offenders.

I have to tell you, I am shocked.” Id. at 4-5. Judge Pickholz also ordered Mr. Epstein to\nreport as a Level III sex offender every 9o days in New York. Id. at l2. “I am sorry [Mr. Epstein]\nmay have to come here every 9o days. He can give up his New York home [on East 7lst. St.] if\nhe does not want to come every 9o days.” Id.

So one question I have for each side is what about\n\n7 New Mexico. That's half of the question.\n\n8 The rest of the question is as follous: Mr. Epstein\n\n9 has applied in New York state to louer his sex offender status\nlo from what's called a level 3, which is the highest level which\nll I think carries with it a high risk of recidivism, according to\nl2 these levels and to sex offender regulation.\n\nl3 And he sought to have that louered to level l. His\n\nl4 application was denied, as I understand the proceedings, by the\nl5 Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders New York state and then in\nl6 state court by the courts and, particularly, a decision of the\nl7 Honorable Justice Ruth Pickholz on our about January l8, 2oll.\nl8 I believe that decision was appealed to the New York State\n\nl9 Appellate Division and was unanimously upheld.\n2o I read this morning a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of the\nal proceedings before Judge Pickholz which I'm likely to place on\n22 the docket after today's session. And the question is for each\n23 side. First of all, they're free to comment on my description\n24 of the proceeding before Judge Pickholz.\n25 But the question is whether there were or are other\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo5l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000518.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 8 of 74 8\n\nl legal or administrative proceedings in Florida, the Virgin\n\n2 Islands, New Mexico, and any other jurisdiction comparable to\n\n3 the one before Judge Pickholz in which she ruled on l-l8-2oll.\n4 So I'm not suggesting that there are, although I think\n5 I did read someplace that there may be some proceeding pending\n6 in New Mexico.

I'm looking for any transcripts in\n\nlo particular and administrative or legal proceedings in other\n\nll states relating in any way to Mr. Epstein's sex offender\n\nl2 status.\n\nl3 The third question on my mind is this: The defense\n\nl4 has submited a brief financial summary to the Court of\n\nl5 Mr. Epstein's assets. And I, as you knou, permited that it be\nl6 submited under seal for, among other reasons that were on my\nl7 mind, not to slou the proceedings doun.\n\nl8 The summary is cursory I would say, short, less than a\nl9 page and does not fully assist me in rendering the bail/remand\n2o decision, that is to say, in its detail or absence of detail.\n2l And moreover, the information provided in that summary seems to\n22 be knoun already to the government in other ways.

I was surprised to learn that very recently. I’m\ncertain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.” Later in the :\nhearing, atorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.\nJust to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate\nor to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in\nsupport of Professor Dershouitz’s motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. :\nDershouitz, l:l9-cv-o3377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstein- /\nrelated.” My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, :\nor advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershouitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on\nanyone’s behalf in co-authoring the law journal article.\nVery truly yours,\nBruce A. Green\ncc: AUSA Maurene Comey; Martin G.

See United States v. Maxwell, l:2o-cr-33o, Dkt. No. l (S.D.N.Y. June 29,\n2o2o). In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts.

On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of ail\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No, 2o-33o (S.D.N.Y.). We\nare concerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #6l at 2 (emphasis added).)\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information.

Accordingly, while\nwe join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make\nthis narrou independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of\nwithholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo747\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000748.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66- Filed o7/29/25 Page 3of lo\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure; (ll) whether the\ndefendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\nthe disclosure; (i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular\ncase; (iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi) the\ncurrent status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that\nof their families; (vi) the extent to which the desired material—\neither permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously made\npublic; (vi) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who\nmight be affected by disclosure are still alive; and (ix) the additional\nneed for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nIn re Craig, l33 F.3d at lo6.\n\nOn July 22, 2o25, the Court directed the Government to file a memorandum of law\n“addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as germane to\nits application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). The Court also directed the\nGovernment to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, counsel for the Government\nreviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government provided notice to the\nvictims of the motion to unseal,” and to submit: (l) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand jury\nmaterials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of the\nEpstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein\nand Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits.

The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. Jn re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can\ngovernment opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n* See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000750.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 5oflo\nnature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the\nunderlying proceedings.\n\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000751.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 6of lo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000752.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 7 of lo\n6. The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.

Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by disclosure are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\ndetective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\nDetective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

In addition, the Government has nou provided notice\nto all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at issue in this\nmotion. The Government has atempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have\nbeen unsuccessful. In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other\nindividuals identified in the transcripts.\n\nC. Provision of Materials to the Court\n\nThe Court directed the Government to submit: (l) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of\nthe Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein\nand Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits.

As to the final category, the Government provides a description of all of the underlying\nmaterials presented to the grand jury as well as copies of, and proposed redactions to, certain\nmaterials presented to the grand jury.\n\nThe Government is submiting these materials ex parte and under seal, as they relate to\ngrand jury proceedings and include information related to victims, including but not limited to\nvictim-identifying information of individuals who neither testified at trial or who were the subject\nof testimony at trial.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000759.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 69 Filed o8/o4/25 Pagelof2\nMEMO ENDORSED August 4, 2o25 Page l\nDocket and file. e\nVIA EMAIL TO JUDGE BERMAN:\nHon.

Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”. In the end we are the biggest voices of the truth and the truth always comes\nout in time.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000761.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Pagelof4\n<S U.S. Department of Justice\nSE” United States Atorney\n\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Jacob K.

(Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nIn particular, on July l8, 2o25, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury\ntranscripts from these cases, subject to appropriate redactions. (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785). The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63;\nMaxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submited on July 29, 2o25 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell\nDkt. 796). In addition, the Court set a schedule whereby the defendants and victims could set out\ntheir positions on or before August 5, 2o25. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3-4; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 4).\n\nOn July 3l, 2o25, the Court directed the Government to provide additional information by\nAugust 4, 2o25, in particular, in the Epstein case, a leter:\n\nl.

Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000763.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of 4\nHon.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000764.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\n\nHon.

Engelmayer, U.S.D.J.\n\nAugust 4, 2o25\n\nPage 4 of 4\naffirmed l47 F.2d 336 (Sth Cir. l945) (“The same jurisdiction that was sought in the beginning\ncontinues to exist insofar as the integrity and preservation of the minutia and minutes and\nproceedings of those steps are concerned. What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged\nby either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.\nAnd the only jurisdiction over such maters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n\n‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n? Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000767.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 2of5\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000768.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of5\nBSF\n\nA. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000769.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of5\nBSF\naffirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000770.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 ~ Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of5\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. /d. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

The issue before the\nCourt is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or\n| whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\nconsideration of the facts and the law) that he is guilty.

It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000802.jpg": "Cas@’4Sol4-4648o-RME DbeuMenPsh Piles KV lSusagrd gets oF 33\n(“Jeffrey Epstein never once checked in with City cops in eight-plus years since a Manhatan :\njudge ordered him to do so every 9o days”).\nMr. Epstein is a Level II sex offender in New York State which is the highest category\nof risk to reoffend.

(McGuirk, Kelly) (Entered: l2/lo/2o2o)\n\nl2/l4/2o2o 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(McGuirk, Kelly) (Entered: l2/lo/2o2o)\n\nl2/l4/2o2o 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

This Opinion is provided pursuant to instructions from Peters and Peters Solicitors LLP’ dated l2\nAugust 2o2o in the context of bail proceedings relating to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell before the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York. Subsequent instructions have confirmed that Ms\nMaxwell will execute a waiver of her right to extradition that could be exhibited to a future extradition\nrequest made by the United States and relied upon in any extradition proceedings. The specific\nquestions asked by Peters and Peters are atached at Annex A. A summary of counsel’s relevant\nexperience is atached at Annex B. The waiver is atached at Annex C.\n\n2. Insummary:\n\n(a) Extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom are governed by the Extradition Act 2oo3\n(‘the 2oo3 Act’) and, in general, comprise; (i) a hearing before a designated ‘appropriate\nJudge’ (the extradition hearing); and (i) an appeal, subject to a leave requirement.\n\n(b) In proceedings under the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may consent to their extradition\nwhich has the effect of removing the need for an extradition hearing and waiving the\nperson’s statutory appeal rights.\n\n(c) In the majority of cases, proceedings in England and Wales in relation to US extradition\nrequests are concluded in under two years’. The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Detention dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l2 of 29\nthis as a weighty factor”. Second, a court would be likely to consider that the interests of the\nvictims’’ would be best served by a trial in the United States. The High Court has held that the\ninterests of victims” “will be in having a trial at a place where, if they do give evidence or wish to be\npresent, they can be so” ”. Third, Ms Maxwell’s connections to the UK*’ do not appear to be of a\ntype likely to be considered substantial in this context.\nMental and physical condition\n34. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to establish that her physical or mental condition\n\nis such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite her*'. In order to rely on her physical or\nmental health in opposition to extradition, Ms Maxwell would need to serve evidence sufficient to\nmeet the statutory test. Most cases in the ‘unjust’ category relate to the persons’ fitness to plead to\notherwise to participate in trial proceedings. Oppression is a high threshold, not easily surmountable*\nand stress and hardship, which occur in most extradition cases, are not sufficient®’. Even in cases\nwhere the requested person suffers from a serious medical conditions, it is often possible for the\nrequesting state gives an assurance as to the medical care that will be provided™, or an undertaking to\nreturn an individual if they are later found to be unfit to plead*, and thus ensure that extradition is\npossible notwithstanding the requested person’s medical problems.\n\n’® Love v United States [2ol8] l WLR 2889, para. 28.\n\n7” Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 83A(3)(a).\n\n8 Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 83A(3)(a).\n\n” Shaw v United States [2ol4] EWHC 4654 (Admin), paragraph 6l.

With respect to France, we have been informed\nthat France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States.””.\n\n2. The international ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French nationality appear as one\nof the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\n“Ms Maxwell’s history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of\nflight. Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States. She holds multiple foreign citizenships, has familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant\nvalue. In particular, she is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to\nextradite its citizens”.\n\n3.

The Protective Order in Giuffre v. Maxwell\n\nCounts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell commited\nperjury during two civil depositions taken in Giuffre v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case Virginia\nGiuffre filed in 2ol5. Giuffre claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell’s atorney-hired\npress agent denied as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Giuffre’s numerous allegations, over the span\nof four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause Giuffre to be “sexually abused\nand trafficked” by Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n' See Norman Mailer, “An Appeal to Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy,” 5/ll/8o New York\nTimes.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 23\nC. The Setlement And Boies Schiller’s Refusal To Comply With The\nProtective Order\n\nIn 2ol7, the parties setled the defamation claim, and the case was dismissed. Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, 325 F.

HH.\nNeedless to say, neither Maxwell nor her atorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that\napplication or to contest the government’s representations in support of the application.

At A Minimum, This Court Should Order A Hearing At Which Maxwell\nMay Inquire Into The Circumstances Surrounding The Government’s\nMisrepresentations To i\n\nIf the Court is disinclined to grant relief on the present record, then at a minimum it\nshould hold an evidentiary hearing to probe the government’s misstatements to [I\nand the extent to which the prosecutor’s office had, in fact, coordinated with J prior\nto the issuance of the grand jury subpoena.

Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to\nlead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v. Stern, No. o3 Cr. 8l, 2oo3 WL 22743897, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2o, 2oo3).\n\nAlthough issues of materiality are generally mixed questions of law and fact normally left\nto a jury, see Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23, under certain circumstances, like those presented in\nthis case, a court can decide this issue under Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a trial will\nnot assist in determining whether the Government can prove to a reasonable juror that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct violated l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). United States v. Nitschke, 843 F.

Counts 5 and 6 Should Be Dismissed\n\nNone of the questions that elicited the allegedly perjurious testimony were material to the\nproceeding in which the testimony was given. As Judge Preska ruled, the questions were “far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell.” Ex. l at 7. Ms. Maxwell was a civil defendant in a defamation action\npremised upon a statement issued by her lawyer in the United Kingdom that Giuffre’s claims\nwere “obvious lies”—a statement that was, as shoun above, true. Whether Ms. Maxwell was\nable to make a list of “girls” who were at Mr. Epstein’s properties, knew who Epstein was\nhaving sex with (apparently when Ms. Maxwell was having sex with Epstein), was aware of the\n“presence of toys or devices,” or gave a massage to Epstein or Accuser-2 was completely\nirrelevant to the defamation litigation.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s testimony could not have influenced any fact finder in the civil case, nor\ncould the questions—no mater hou they were answered—have reasonably led to any admissible\nevidence in the defamation action, which required Giuffre to prove that her statements about her\nage, her being trafficked to unspecified “foreign presidents” and Professor Dershouitz, or\nwhether President Clinton flew on a helicopter piloted by Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other\ndemonstrably false statements, were true.°\n\n® In the event that Counts Five and Six are not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell would request that\nadditional excerpts be read those to the jury beyond those set forth in the Indictment, including but not\nlimited to those set forth in this motion, for purposes of completeness.

In any case, the Court takes\n\n2 comfort in the fact that Ms. Maxwell recognizes that she has\n\n3 the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and evidence at her\n\n4 disposal when the appropriate time comes to fight this fight\n\n5 doun the road.\n\n6 A word about Ms. Maxwell's July 2ol6 deposition.

Excerpts of that <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> were also submited as\n\nll exhibits to various other briefing. Ms. Maxwell argues that\nl2 the \"privacy interests of those who resist disclosure\" -- in\nl3 the case of her deposition, Ms. Maxwell's interests -- counsel\nl4 against unsealing deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>. Ms. Maxwell argues\nl5 that her discussion of certain \"intimate maters\" during that\nl6 deposition should remain sealed.\n\nl7 During this deposition, Ms. Maxwell was asked\n\nl8 repeatedly about her oun sexual activity with consenting\n\nl9 adults. Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2ol6\n2o deposition, she provided testimony in response to those\nal questions. As noted earlier, the presumption of public access\n22 does atach to this <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> (although, has the Court has\n23 observed, to a lesser extent than if it were submited in\n24 connection with a dispositive motion).\n25 Here, houever, public access to certain parts of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002474.jpg": "LOAas6 W2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36-9 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 33 7\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> is outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's countervailing\n\n2 interests in resisting disclosure of the details of her\n\n5 private, intimate relationships with consenting adults. This\n\n4 testimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking\n5 and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute\n\n6 in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some\n7 may be left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in\n\n8 keeping private the details of her sexual relationships with\n\n9 consenting adults warrants the sealing of those portions of her\nlo testimony (and any materials that reference them).\n\nll For the sake of efficiency, my chambers will share\n\nl2 with the parties a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that highlights the\nl3 portions of Ms. Maxwell's deposition that should remain\n\nl4 redacted.

The Court finds, as it did for\n2o the last round of motions it considered for unsealing, that\n2l Ms. Giuffre's privacy interests in her medical records, where\n22 they reference the medical treatment she received, outweigh any\n23 public interests in those materials. So when I refer to\n24 medical information to be redacted, I am referring to\n25 information describing medical treatment.

Because these\n6 police reports were obtained through a public records request,\n7 they should be unsealed and docketed in the form that they were\n8 received from the law enforcement agency. This is also\n\n9 consistent with the approach that the Court of Appeals has\n\nlo taken. Consistent with the Court of Appeals' approach, other\nll personal information in these police reports, such as\n\nl2 addresses, should be redacted from previously undisclosed\n\nl3 reports, to the extent such information has not already been\n\nl4 redacted by the law enforcement agency.\n\nl5 As for the names and identifying information of\n\nl6 nonparty Does: At this stage, unless otherwise noted, the only\nl7 Does for whom names and identifying information should be\n\nl8 unsealed are Does l and 2.

STERNHEIAA\nTo be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay\nher trial but rests squarely on the government’s late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution.\nAt the initial appearance on July l4, 2o2o, the defense agreed to the July l2\" trial date\nbased on the government’s representation that is would not file a superseding indictment:\nThe trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's\napproval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is\none, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I\nassume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial\nschedule but other schedule as well.\n\nJuly l4, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at l6 -l7 (emphasis added).\n\nIn response, the Court made the follouing inquiry:\n\nLet me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I\nwill ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments\nadding either defendants or additional charges?\n\nId. at l7.\n\nThe government confirmed:\n\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we\ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.\nId.\n\nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July l2, 2o2l trial date and her\nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.\nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government\nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and\nMs. Maxwell’s prolonged detention.\n\nThis is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government. By adding\ncharges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally\ndestroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time alloted. The continual media\natention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely\nrequire the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that constitutional right\ncan be guaranteed.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002939.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of 239\nEXHIBIT LIST\nExhibit l: Notes from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nExhibit 2: June l4, 2oo7 Email\nExhibit 3: November 2o2o Report, U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Professional\nResponsibility\nExhibit 4: Notes from February ll, 2o2l Call\nExhibit 5: Notes from February 29, 2ol6 Meeting\nExhibit 6: November 3o, 2ol8 Email\nExhibit 7: December 6, 2ol8 Email\nExhibit 8: February 28, 2ol9 Government Leter to Judge Sweet\nExhibit 9: February 28, 2ol9 Government Leter to Judge Netburn\nExhibit lo: — <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> of April 22, 2ol6 Deposition\nExhibit ll: — <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> of July 22, 2ol6 Deposition\nExhibit l2: Affidavit of Dr. Bernard R.

(/d. at 3). She concluded that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the protective order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6).

Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-l at 2). On October l9, 2o2o,\nthe Second Circuit found that Judge Preska “correctly held that the deposition materials are judicial\ndocuments to which the presumption of public access ataches, and did not abuse its discretion in\nrejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests superseded the presumption of access.”\n(Id. at 3).\n\nOn October 22, 2o2o, Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed.

The New York Daily News Article\n\nOn October l3, 2o2o, the New York Daily News published an article describing the\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 meeting (the “Daily News Article” or the “Article”).*° The Article stated,\namong other things, that defense atorneys representing victims of Epstein and Maxwell “urged”\nthe USAO-SDNY to “open an investigation of the duo” during that meeting. Citing two\nanonymous sources, the Article described the defense atorneys’ alleged efforts to “pique” the\nGovernment’s interest “in a second meeting in the summer of 2ol6 after Maxwell allegedly\n3° See Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6: sources, New York Daily News, Oct. l3, 2o2o,\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7ycebfnszu-story.html.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 239\nway circumvented Martindell; rather, the Government sought court approval to enforce a subpoena\nand then folloued the directives it received.*”\n\nMost critically, houever, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell,\nMaxwell offers no legal authority for the proposition that suppression is the proper remedy.*®\nIndeed, none of the Second Circuit cases applying Martindell contemplate suppression as a\nremedy. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional circumstances or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of protective orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\ndiscretion in modifying the protective order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\nprotective order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\napplication and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a protective order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s invitation to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\nprotective order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a protective order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other\nindividuals’ depositions, who were not parties to the protective order.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 239\ni. Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift protective orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s exception to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d l37, l43 (2d Cir.\n2ol8) (quoting Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 238 (2oll) (internal quotation marks\n\n86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll7 of 239\n\nThe defendant repeatedly argues that the Government’s failure to mention AUSA-l’s prior\ncontact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6 was a misrepresentation that led to the modification of the\nprotective order. The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\nincorrect. As an initial mater, the Government did not insist, contrary to Maxwell’s twisted\nreading of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, that “there had been no contact whatsoever” between Boies Schiller and\nthe Government at any time prior to the Government opening its investigation. (Def. Mot. 3 at l).\nInstead, Chief Judge McMahon’s question was more specific: referencing Chemical Bank and the\ndesire to avoid “a Chemical Bank kind of situation,” Chief Judge McMahon asked about contacts\nbetween the two parties “prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation.”\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added); see also Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (omiting the italicized portion\nof the question)). In response, the Government described accurately its communications with\nBoies Schiller that had occurred in the time period surrounding the opening of its investigation and\nthe issuance of the subpoena. Additionally, and in light of the Government’s prior arguments to\nChief Judge McMahon relating to Chemical Bank,*® the Government atempted to address the\nmisconduct at issue in that case: namely the production of confidential documents without seeking\nmodification of a protective order by confirming that, here, no such production had yet occurred.\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2) (noting that Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there\n* See, e.g., Exs. 8 & 9 at 2-3 (discussing Chemical Bank as rejecting a contempt request where a\nparty “compl[ied] with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order” and\nfocusing arguments on the nature of the production of documents); (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l5) (the\nGovernment describing Chemical Bank as “essentially say[ing]: You should have asked, but of\ncourse this is fine for you to disclose this information to the government based on the validly issued\ngrand jury subpoena”); cf. (id. at 4 (Chief Judge McMahon describing Chemical Bank as saying\n“the proper procedure [for the production of documents] is for somebody to make a motion to be\nrelieved from the terms of the protective order”), 2o (Chief Judge McMahon stating that “in the\nChemical Bank case, it all was ex post facto and it all happened’’)).\n\n9o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003053.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 239\n\nSecond, the Government did not misrepresent the extent of its knouledge of the contents\nof Boies Schiller’s files. As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government\nhad “either litle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there\nare [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l7). In support of her argument, Maxwell\ncites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David\nBoies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2ol6, asking ‘if the\nSouthern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the\nGovernment has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-l does not\nrecall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-l\ndoes not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury\n(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2ol6 meeting refer to the existence of depositions\ngenerally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general\nunderstanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at\n2l). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knouledge of the\ncontents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon were incorrect.\n\nIn sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief\nJudge McMahon, and as such, the good faith exception applies. To the contrary, the record before\nthe Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nquestion and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in\nconnection with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knouledge of the contents of that file,\nand the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the protective order.\nUpon receiving a court order issued by a Chief United States District Judge who had carefully\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444).

As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 239\n\nThe defendant asks the Court for a drastic remedy, namely suppression of a// evidence the\nGovernment obtained pursuant to the subpoena, as well as the dismissal of Counts Five and Six.\nIn so doing, the defendant seeks a windfall to which she is not entitled based on unprecedented\nclaims that ignore the facts and the law. Suppression of all materials the Government obtained\npursuant to the subpoena is unwarranted here, particularly where certain of the materials have been\nsubsequently unsealed by Judge Preska in the underlying civil litigation, including Maxwell’s\nApril 2ol6 deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). The Second Circuit\naffirmed Judge Preska’s ruling in October 2o2o, finding that the Court “correctly held that the\ndeposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access ataches,\nand did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests\nsuperseded the presumption of access.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-\nl at 3).” On October 22, 2o2o, the defendant’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5\nCiv. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3). In February 2o2l, a redacted version of the defendant’s July\n2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l). In other words,\nhad the Government not obtained an order modifying the protective order, the Government\ninevitably would have discovered and obtained, at a minimum, the defendant’s April 2ol6\ndeposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> and a portion of the July 2ol6 <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that form the basis of the charges in\nCounts Five and Six.\n* Relatedly, the defendant moved to modify the criminal protective order in order to use\nconfidential criminal discovery materials in filings she intended to submit in civil litigation. The\ndefendant raised this precise point—that if the Court ultimately decided that it was inappropriate\nfor the Government to proceed by subpoena, the Government would claim inevitable discovery.\n(Dkt. No. 54 at 3). The defendant offered no coherent explanation of hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no\ncase law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery argument by the\nGovernment should foreclose unsealing in a civil case. This Court rejected the defendant’s motion\nto modify the criminal protective order. (Dkt. No. 5l). The Second Circuit also dismissed the\ndefendant’s appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 7l).\n\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 239\n\nContrary to the defendant’s argument (Def. Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), l998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary\ncircumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\nconcluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\nAmendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 239\njury.”). At this stage, the defendant must identify defects so fundamental that the charged\nstatements cannot, as a mater of law, support a perjury conviction. She has failed to do so, and\nher motion should be denied.\n\nl. April 2ol6 Deposition\n\nAt the April 2ol6 deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant about hou Giuffre\ncame to Epstein’s home (Ex. lo at l4:9-l7:4), whether hired massage therapists engaged in sexual\nactivity with Epstein (id. at 5l:l3-55:l6), and the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s Florida\ncriminal case (id. at l7l:25-l73:l2, l83:25-l86:2l), among other topics. The <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> makes\nclear that when the defendant did not understand a question, she said so. (See, e.g., id. at 9:4-9\n(“[C]an you please clarify the question. I don’t understand what you mean by female, I don’t\nunderstand what you mean by recruit.”), 39:23-24 (“I don’t understand what your question is\nasking.”’), 94:l8-95:4 (“You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap\nme, I will not be trapped.’’), l38:6 (“Define relationship.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a\ngood question, sorry.’’).\n\nCount Five charges the defendant with perjury arising from two colloquies at this\ndeposition. First, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions about whether the\ndefendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired\n“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-l8). Guiuffre’s counsel asked\nwhether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the\ndefendant testified that they were all adults except for Giuffre, who she acknouledged at least\nclaimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:l8-25l:l2). Giuffre’s counsel then asked questions\nabout whether Epstein had a “sexual preference for underage minors,” which drew objections from\n\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 239\ninteractions with the defendant and Epstein at Epstein’s various properties. See, e.g., Indictment\n§{ 7(a) (“MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-l on multiple occasions at\nEpstein’s residences.”). Accordingly, a rational juror, after hearing the evidence, could find that\nthe question called for the names of minors that the defendant interacted with at any of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s properties, that the defendant answered that she was aware of no such minors other than\nGiuffre, and therefore that her answer was false. And even if the defendant identifies some\nplausible ambiguity—and she has not—the terms in this question are ones “with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree,” and therefore are not fundamentally ambiguous.\nLighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThe defendant points out that, in response to an earlier question asking her to list the\nunderage girls she “met and brought” to Epstein’s house, she said that she could not do so. (Def.\nMot. 4 at l2-l3). She argues that the charged question was “improper” because it asked her to\ngenerate a list “from events that had happened nearly two decades previously.” (/d.). Her\nunpersuasive after-the-fact efforts to justify her answer provide no basis to keep this question from\nthe jury. As noted above, the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> makes clear (and a jury could find) that when the defendant\ndid not understand or could not answer a question, she said so. To the extent the defendant is\narguing that her answer was literally true, a reasonable jury could find otherwise. In this respect,\nthe Government notes, among other things, that in response to the earlier question, the defendant\nsaid that she could not make a list not because she could not remember events from that long ago\nbut “because that list -- it never happened that I can think of.” (Ex. lo at 382:4-l3) (emphasis\nadded). And in response to the charged question, the defendant said that she “was not aware of\nanybody” under l8—that is, the list would be empty. See Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d at 4l3 (“Olivieri,\nif truly confused, could also have asked for clarification.

Second, doing so “risks invading ‘the\ninviolable function of the jury’ in our criminal justice system.’” /d. at 28l (citation omited).\nAccordingly, if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined with a\ndefendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” Jd.\n\nThe exception to this rule is “extraordinarily narrou” because, in the normal course, the\n“government must make a detailed presentation of the entirety of the evidence before a district\ncourt can dismiss an indictment on sufficiency grounds,” which the Government is not required to\ndo at the motion-to-dismiss stage. /d. at 282 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). That\npoint is underscored by United States v. Nitsche, 843 F. Supp. 2d 4 (D.D.C. 2oll), on which the\ndefendant relies. There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a child enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence. First, houever, the court explained that the question was ripe\nbecause “(l) Defendant has stipulated to the entire record that is relevant to Count I; (2) the\nGovernment has had several opportunities to make a proffer of any additional facts, to conduct\nany subsequent investigation, and to ask the Court for further delay to seek more evidence; and (3)\nbecause the record is limited to the chat.” Jd. at 9. Accordingly, “[t]he transcripts themselves\nprovide the Court with all of the relevant undisputed facts to decide the motion.” /d. Here, of\ncourse, that is simply not the case and, in particular, there is no stipulation as to the entire relevant\nrecord.\n\nUnder the relevant legal standard, the defendant’s statements were material if they could\nhave led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the factfinder in the defendant’s\ncivil case. Evaluating that standard necessarily implicates facts beyond the deposition testimony\nitself and Judge Preska’s unsealing order,*’ such as identification of the allegedly defamatory\n°° The defendant observes that Judge Preska redacted some of the statements that form the basis\nof Count Six, stating that the “testimony is . . . far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 348\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.*®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter.

The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 42 of 348\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'’4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR.

Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

AK does not remember one\nway or the other if any of the atorneys referenced the possibility of perjury.\n\no AK recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have the same challenges.\nAK recalls thinking in her mind that if the depositions were about the underlying\nconduct that had all of the issues that gave AK pause after the meeting (length of\ntime that had passed, sense there must have been a reason SDFL resolved the case\nthe way they did) were not alleviated by a perjury-based prosecution.\n\no AK does not recall ever knouing anything about the substance of the depositions\nand does not remember anyone sending her a deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>.\n\no AK does not remember who had been deposed or who might have been the\nsubject of a possible perjury investigation.\n\no No investigation into perjury was ever opened.\n\ne AK took no further action re Epstein after calling Sean Watson.\n\no Though there may be emails or calls AK cannot remember, she knous that she\ntook no action after the call to Sean Watson.

Of course, the government\nmust knou that myriad examples exist. United States v. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236—37\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2), is instructive:\n\nSuccinctly, the prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin the witness doun to\n\nthe specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o. Any number of\n\nstraightforward follou-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For\n\nexample, in addition to the “atempt” question mentioned earlier, the government\n\ncould have cured the ambiguity by supplying the date, time or location of the target\n\nmeeting, focusing Cicalese's atention on the specific events at\n\nissue. See Razzaia, 37o F.Supp. at 578-79. Left naked, the government's imprecise\n\nquestion did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with\n\na sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering\n\nas he did. Jd. at 579. Asking simple follou-up questions could have resolved the\n\nimprecision and fulfilled the government's obligation under Bronston. Whether by\n\nstrategy or inadvertence, the government did not do so.\nThe Court granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. /d. at 232.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Landau, 737 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. l99o), the court\ndismissed a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's\ngrand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions here are fundamentally ambiguous\nand cannot as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction. Landau's motion is therefore\ngranted and the indictment is dismissed.” /d. at 784-85 (emphasis added). The same is true\nhere. In the context of the questions preceding the selectively quoted testimony in Counts Five\nand Six and the transcripts as a whole, the selected questions were fundamentally ambiguous.\n\nIn United States v. Manapat, 928 F.2d lo97 (llth Cir.l99l), the Eleventh Circuit\naffirmed an acquital on the grounds of fundamental ambiguity as a result of the content of the\nform that was the basis of the prosecution. There, the defendant applied for an Airman Medical\nCertificate to the Federal Aviation Administration. The application included a section entitled\n“Medical History” that contained twenty-four questions regarding “conditions.” The first twenty-\n\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of l6\nconvicted of perjury for an answer given under oath that is literally true, even if it is\nunresponsive and intended to mislead. The Court noted that “|t]he burden is on the questioner to\npin the witness doun to the specific object of the questioner's inquiry.” Jd. at 36o. The answers\nto the questions in Counts Five and Six are “literally true” as discussed in detail in Ms.\nMaxwell’s moving brief.\n\nIll. The Questions and Answers Were Immaterial\n\nThe government is confusing arguable “relevance” and “materiality” which “are not\nsynonymous.” United States v. Litvak, 8o8 F.3d l6o, l74 (2d Cir. 2ol5). It is not enough that any\nalleged “‘misrepresentation” concern “a variable that matered to the” recipient of the\ninformation. The government must prove that alleged misstatements were “capable of\ninfluencing a decision” of the intended recipient. /d. It remains unclear hou the government will\nargue this issue. Houever, the questions were improper and could not have produced admissible\nevidence for a jury to consider. There was nothing “influenced” on the part of the questioners\nwho would not have accepted any answer from Ms. Maxwell as true. Moreover, the questions\nwere not calculated to lead to discoverable evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court has the necessary transcripts to decide this issue in Ms. Maxwell’s favor,\npretrial.

First, the Protective Order by its terms affords Maxwell a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. Mot. 3, Ex. A, § 3 (defining “CONFIDENTIAL” information as that\nwhich “implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of . .. Ghislaine Maxwell”\n(emphasis added)). What would it say to civil litigants lf they could not rely on a court’s promise\nof confidentiality, at least absent notice and an opportunity to object to any breach of that\npromise (which, of course, Maxwell was denied here). See Mot. 3, Ex. A, § l4 (precluding\nmodification of the Protective Order absent “good cause shoun follouing notice to all parties\nand an opportunity for them to be heard”).\n\nSecond, Martindell affords Maxwell a reasonable expectation of privacy. Martindell, 594\nF.2d at 294. In Martindell, the Second Circuit held that “the proper procedure” to obtain\nconfidential material under a Protective Order, “as the Government should knou, was either to\nsubpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a grand jury\ninvestigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to quash or modify the\nsubpoena, [Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)] or to seek permissive intervention in the private action\npursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)], for the purpose of obtaining vacation or modification of the\nprotective order.” /d. (emphasis added)). By affording Maxwell a right to notice and an\nopportunity to be heard, Martindell makes clear that, having been denied those rights when the\nsubpoena was first issued, Maxwell has standing to challenge the government’s conduct nou.\nId.; see Lavender, 583 F.2d at 632.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 2o\nMaxwell’s two deposition transcripts, Resp. at 94 & n.4l. And as to Count 6 in particular\n(alleging perjury in the July 2ol6 deposition), the government concedes, as it must, that Judge\nPreska has refused to unseal all of the testimony charged in the indictment, except one question\nand one answer. Resp. at 94 n.4l. The government offers no explanation for hou it inevitably\nwould have obtained all 9o,ooo pages of material from Boies Schiller when the two deposition\ntranscripts don’t even total l,ooo pages.\n\nFourth, the government misunderstands the burden of proof. The government tries to\nfault Maxwell for seeking “suppression of a// evidence [it] obtained pursuant to the subpoena,”\ncalling this a “windfall.” Resp. at 95. But it’s the government’s burden to prove the applicability\nof the inevitable discovery exception. Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (inevitable discovery doctrine\napplies only “if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably\nwithout the constitutional violation”) (rejecting government’s inevitable discovery claim). The\ngovernment must explain why Maxwell isn’t entitled to this remedy, not the other way around.\nThe government has fallen far, far short of meeting its burden, if only because it offers no\nargument—on the facts or the law—for hou it might have inevitably discovered more than\n89,ooo pages of material that hasn’t been and won’t be unsealed by Judge Preska. This Court\nshould have no confidence, much less a “high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies\nnecessary to the legal discovery of the contested evidence would be resolved in the government's\nfavor.” United States v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (articulating inevitable discovery\nstandard).\n\nThe inevitable discovery doctrine does not apply.\n\nII.

This testimony is, in any case, far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to\nthe dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some may\nbe left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in keeping private the\ndetails of her sexual relationships with consenting adults warrants the sealing\nof those portions of her testimony (and any materials that reference them).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3847\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l7 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of6\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe testimony at issue is undeniably private: it relates exclusively to Ms. Maxwell’s\nconsensual adult sexual activities involving “‘sex toys or devices used in sexual activities” and\na “three-way sexual” encounter involving an adult “blond and brunete.” See Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 567 (U.S. 2oo3) (“It suffices for us to acknouledge that adults may\nchoose to enter upon [a] relationship in the confines of their homes and their oun private lives\nand still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate\nconduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is\nmore enduring.”); see also Griswold v. Connecticut, 38l U.S. 479, 485-86 (U.S. l965). And\nMs. Maxwell proposes only those redactions “narrouly tailored” to preserve her privacy\ninterest in her intimate, consensual adult sexual activities. Press-Enterprise IT, lo6 S.Ct. at\n2743. Rather than seek to redact either the argument or the surrounding testimony, Ms.\nMaxwell marked for redaction those limited portions of the deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that Judge\nPreska ordered sealed. The remaining unredacted portions generally describe the redacted\ntestimony such that the public and media will have no issue ascertaining the nature of the\nlegal issues nor fulfill their role in monitoring the Courts. Inclusion of the exact lines\nreferencing “three-way sexual activity” or “sex toys” does not add to the argument but\nredacting those lines does preserve Ms. Maxwell’s privacy in testimony that was both\ncompelled and obtained under highly improper methods.\n\nIn addition to her privacy interests, Ms. Maxwell seeks to preserve her right to a fair\ntrial free from unfair pretrial publicity concerning what may ultimately be deemed\n“inadmissible” evidence at the criminal trial. United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d l2l, l28 (2d Cir.\nl995) (“compelling interests” that counterbalance any presumption of access include the\n“privacy interests of the defendant” and the fair trial rights of the defendant).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l9 Filed o4/l9/2l Pagelof2\nPN U.S. Department of Justice\nSE” United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 43 of 349\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l38 of 349\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, houever, did not\nask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form\nfurther clarified the sentence, providing that after serving l2 months in the Palm Beach County\nDetention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention\nFacility . . . to be served consecutive to the l2 month sentence,” folloued by “l2 months\nCommunity Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand writen after “6 months” but then crossed\nout and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”\n\nA. June 3o, 2oo8: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court\n\nEpstein, with his atorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of\nsolicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of\nprocurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.'”4 At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the\nFBI case agent atended as spectators, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts\nof the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal\ninformation:\n\n[B]etween August l, 2oo4 and October 3l, 2oo5, the defendant in\n\nPalm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit\n\n[prostitution] on three or more occasions.

Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom.

Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l4 of 349\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l6 of 349\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\nFe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

It further held that a\ncourt should modify a protective order that a party reasonably relied on only if the order had\nbeen improvidently granted or upon a shouing of extraordinary circumstances or compelling\nneed.\n\nJudge McMahon held a second ex parte hearing on April 9, 2ol9.

The\nGovernment did not mention any of the communications with BSF atorneys in 2ol6.\n\nJudge McMahon issued a sealed order granting the Government’s application folloued\nby a sealed opinion dated April 9, 2ol9. In the opinion, she explained that Martindell governed\nthe Government’s application, but that two of the Martindell factors supported modification of\nthe protective order. First, Maxwell did not reasonably rely on the protective order because it\nwas subject to modification. Second, the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances\nsupporting modification of the protective order because it could not otherwise obtain information\nabout the high-profile targets of its investigation without tipping them off. Magistrate Judge\nNetburn denied the Government’s similar application in another case, applying the same\nstandard but concluding that the Government had not shoun extraordinary circumstances or\ncompelling need.\n\nFollouing Judge McMahon’s order, BSF turned over its records from the civil litigation\nto the Government.

Much of what the Government obtained through its subpoena,\nincluding the bulk of the deposition transcripts Maxwell nou seeks to suppress, have since been\nunsealed by court order in the civil case. See Giuffre, No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. ll37, l2l2.\n\nI. Discussion\n\nMaxwell objects both to the Government obtaining documents covered by the protective\norder and to the Government’s conduct in doing so. She contends that she agreed to testify in the\ncivil case only because of the protective order, and thus that the Government’s use of her\ndeposition testimony against her would violate her right against compelled self-incrimination.\nShe contends that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents covered by the\nprotective order, and thus that the Government should not have been able to obtain them without\na warrant. And she contends that the Government circumvented the requirements of Martindell\nand violated her due process rights by misleading Judge McMahon about the Government’s prior\ncommunications with BSF.\n\nThe Court finds that none of these arguments support suppression of evidence or justify\nan evidentiary hearing. The Court begins with Maxwell’s claim that the Government violated\nher right against compelled self-incrimination by obtaining her deposition testimony from the\ncivil case. It next turns to her claim that the Government violated her right against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Finally, it addresses Maxwell’s claim that the Government misled Judge\nMcMahon in seeking modification of the protective order in the earlier civil case.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page6of2l\n\nA. The Government did not violate Maxwell’s right against self-incrimination\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The [Supreme] Court has held\nrepeatedly that the Fifth Amendment is limited to prohibiting the use of ‘physical or moral\ncompulsion’ exerted on the person asserting the privilege.” Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S.\n39l, 397 (l976) (quoting Perlman v. United States, 247 U.S. 7, l5 (l9l8)). It does not prohibit\nthe Government from using a defendant’s voluntary statements in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.\n\nTo establish a violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination, Maxwell must\n“demonstrate the existence of three elements: l) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication,\nand 3) the incriminating nature of that communication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d\nll66, ll68 (2d Cir. l987). Maxwell contends that the Government violated her right against\ncompelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies of her deposition transcripts from her earlier\ncivil case. She acknouledges that she could have, but did not, invoke her Fifth Amendment\nrights to avoid providing incriminating testimony. See, e.g., Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe protective order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a subsequent criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\nprotective order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no guarantee that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v. Stat. Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir.\nl989). As the Second Circuit has explained, a civil protective order may (as here) be overturned\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page/7of2l\nor modified by another court in another proceeding. /d. A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil protective order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; Giuffre v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a reasonable basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil protective order against the use of their testimony in a\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page 8of2l\ninculpatory. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 4lo-ll. This is no such case. The existence of deposition\ntranscripts in Maxwell’s civil case is not inculpatory. It is the content of those transcripts that is\nat issue.\n\nIn the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relies primarily on a single\ndistrict court case decided the year before the Second Circuit’s decision in Andover that quashed\na subpoena for deposition testimony covered by a civil protective order. See Dkt. No. l4o, at\nl6-l7 (citing United States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988)); Dkt. No. 2l2, at l2-\nl3 (same). Oshatz does not suggest that the use of civil deposition testimony in a subsequent\ncriminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against compelled self-incrimination—and if it\ndid, that view would be plainly inconsistent with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential\nopinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a court should modify a\nprotective order to allou a government subpoena. Maxwell cites no case in which a court has\nsuppressed evidence because another court erred in modifying a protective order. Even if\nMaxwell were right that the protective order should not have been modified, it would not\ntransform her earlier deposition testimony into the product of coercion.\n\nThe Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against\nher in her perjury trial notwithstanding any violation of her right against compelled self-\nincrimination. The Supreme Court has held that a defendant may be prosecuted for false\nstatements in unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l79\n(l977); United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (l969). As in Knox, Maxwell seeks to suppress\nher deposition transcripts not because they are inculpatory “for a prior or subsequent criminal\nact” but because her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal. Knox,\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page9of2l\n396 U.S. at 82. In these circumstances, the Fifth Amendment does not bar the Government’s use\nof her testimony in a prosecution for perjury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell is not entitled to suppress her deposition\ntranscripts based on her right against compelled self-incrimination.\n\nB. Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in\n\ncivil litigation\n\n“The Fourth Amendment protects ‘[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.’” Carpenter v. United\nStates, l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l3 (2ol8) (alteration in original) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV).\nGovernment activity qualifies as a search under the Fourth Amendment only if it involves a\nphysical intrusion into a constitutionally protected space or the violation of a person’s\n“reasonable expectation of privacy.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 4oo, 4o6-o7 (2ol2)\n(quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 36o (l967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Thus,\ngovernment agents need a warrant to rummage through someone’s home, listen in on their phone\ncalls, or search through their phones seized incident to arrest. The Fourth Amendment imposes\nno limitation on their ability to gather evidence of public activity or review public records.\n\nA person has a reasonable expectation of privacy only if they seek to keep something\nprivate and have an objectively reasonable expectation that it will remain private. Smith v.\nMaryland, 442 U.S. 735, 74o (l979). The Supreme Court has held that people generally lack a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily disclose to others. See id. at\n743-44; United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 44o (l976). This is true even if they expect that\ninformation to be safeguarded and used only for specific purposes. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nheld that police may obtain bank records or a list of phone numbers a person has dialed without a\nwarrant. Smith, 442 U.S. at 742; Miller, 425 U.S. at 44o.

See |\nIn re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d l22l, l225 (2d Cir. |\nl99l) (“The proper procedure .., is... to subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a |\npending proceeding such as a grand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised |\n2 All materials under this docket number, l9-mc-l49, including this opinion, will be kept under seal as |\nrelated to a pending grand jury investigation. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo88o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo493o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 27 |\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order. Permissive |\nintervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |\nprotective order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na protective order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o |\n(2d Cir. l986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |\nTel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l, 294 (2d Cir. l979)], that ‘this extraordinary writ [mandamus] would |\nhardly be available ... where the only purpose was to obtain modification of a pretrial order for |\ninvestigative purposes.’”), Or it could have filed a writ of mandamus, since “mandamus lies to |\ncompel a judge to unseal documents shoun to be material and necessary in litigation,” United |\nStates v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 423 (2d Cir. l983). But the Government has done neither of the |\nabove; instead, it has moved pursuant to the All Writs Act. It cites no authority for that |\nprocedure. |\nNonetheless, there is precedent in this Circuit for granting procedurally puzzling :\napplications by the Government to unseal materials for use by a grand jury. For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations. Jd. at 42o-2l. On appeal, the Second Circuit rejected the defendant- |\nappellants’ argument that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting the |\nGovernment’s application: “A court may direct access to such material upon a proper shouing of\nSDNY_GM_ooooo882\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4932 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nneed. Here such a shouing was amply demonstrated. To have refused access to these records in |\nthe face of a subpoena from a grand jury would have been an abuse of discretion.” Jd. at 423. |\nI will, therefore, consider the Government’s application. |\nB. The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., lo4 |\nF.R.D. 559, 57o (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd, 82l F.2d l39 (2d Cir. l987) (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d |\nat 295). The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nabsence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from\n\na grand jury’s scrutiny. As the court reasoned in EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l, language stating that\nthe party receiving designated confidential information “shall not use or disclose the information |\nexcept... by such orders as may be issued by the Court during the course of this litigation” did\n“not lend itself to reasonable reliance that [the Protective Order] will afford permanent secrecy.”\n|\nSee also Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6), where, in view |\nof a provision that said, “This Confidentiality Order shall not prevent anyone from applying to |\n|\nthe Court for relief therefrom,” the Second Circuit held, “Given this provision, it is difficult to |\nsee hou the defendants can reasonably argue that they produced documents in reliance on the |\nfact that the documents would always be kept secret.” |\nThird, there is no evidence before me indicating that the court undertook any sort of |\ndetailed inquiry prior to entering the Protective Order. (Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66 at |\n4:25-5:l2.). Obviously, I was not there, but I have reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of the argument on |\nthe motion for a protective order, and it seems clear that the parties were given ample discretion |\nto designate discovery materials as confidential, with virtually no oversight unless those |\nmaterials were to be filed with the court—in which case a motion for sealing had to be made.° |\n(Protective Order § lo); cf Liton Indus., Inc. v. Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc., l22 F.R.D. 433, |\n435 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (declining to enforce protective order where “the protective order did not |\nadjudicate the appropriateness of confidentiality as to particular items of discovery”). The fact |\n“The question about a protective order, of course there should be a protective order in this case.

And, in fact, I will give you two weeks to do that.\nShould you fail, you can present whatever materials you wish to me and I will decide what the protective order is |\ngoing to be. That’s not a good idea because you knou the case beter than I do, obviously, and so I urge you to\nresolve it by your litigation skills and not leave it up to the ignorant district court judge who doesn’t really get into\na of thing very often.

To Be Filed Under Seal\n\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—\nthat caused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related |\nApplication.” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5.) |\nTo be sure, the convenience of having potentially incriminating testimony readily |\navailable does not in and of itself rise to the level of an extraordinary circumstance. In )\nMartindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |\n“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the maters in connection with |\nwhich the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |\ngrand jury investigative processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |\nthe mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 4o |\nF.3d 592 (2d Cir. l994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :\nshouing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |\none day invoke the Fifth Amendment at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |\nprosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |\ncivil proceeding]... [.] Prosecutors often make do without the testimony of a defendant.” Jd. at |\n595-96 (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296). |\nHere, houever, the extraordinary amount of publicity surrounding all aspects of what I |\nwill call the Epstein mater does create practical limitations to the grand jury’s ability to secure |\ncertain information with the secrecy it requires to conduct an appropriately thorough and |\nthoughtful investigation. Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a situation in |\nwhich the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |\nindependently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743. This is not a case, like United States v. :\nOshatz, 7oo F.

I will\nrespond to any questions or requests you have as promptly as possible, either in writing or by\nhaving you return to the courtroom so I can speak with you in person. In any communication,\nplease do not tell me or anyone else hou the jury stands on the issue of the jury’s verdict until\nafter a unanimous verdict is reached.\n\nFor those of you who took notes during the course of the trial, you should not shou your\nnotes to or discuss your notes with any other juror during your deliberations. Any notes you have\ntaken are to assist you and you alone. The fact that a particular juror has taken notes entitles that\njuror’s views to no greater weight than those of any other juror.\n\nFinally, your notes are not to substitute for your recollection of the evidence in this case.\nIf you have any doubt as to any testimony, you may request that the official trial <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that\nhas been made of these proceedings be read or otherwise provided to you.\n\nAdapted from the charge of the Hon.

This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not introduce a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony.

The government’s motion seeks to unfairly capitalize on this Court’s\ndecision largely overruling Ms. Maxwell’s Daubert challenge to the government’s expert, Dr.\nLisa Rocchio. If the government gets its way, Dr. Rocchio will present the jury with a one-sided\nversion of events while Ms. Maxwell will be crippled in her ability to respond. This Court should\nnot permit the asymmetry the government hopes to create.\n\nThere is no dispute that Drs. Dietz and Loftus are supremely qualified in their respective\nareas of expertise. Atached as Exhibit l is the defense disclosure of the expert opinions of Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus. That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s construction of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case. To the extent the government contends these opinions don’t “fit,” that objection is flat-\nout wrong or at least premature, since the government hasn’t put any evidence on yet.

See generally United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp.\n2d ll4, ll7-l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (discussing requirements).!° As the Court has noted, any\nargument on that score must await the presentation of evidence. (See Nov. ll, 2o2l Sealed Tr., at\nl94). But at present, the defendant has identified no relevant fact testimony that Dr. Hall could\noffer. Because his expert testimony is similarly inadmissible, he should be excluded as a witness\nabsent further developments at trial.\n\nlo To be clear, although Dr. Hall could conceivably testify as to his recollection of some prior\ninconsistent statement by Minor Victim-4, the rough <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of his interview with her cannot\nbecome admissible as extrinsic evidence of Minor Victim-4’s statements regardless hou she\ntestifies. That label—“rough <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>”—comes from the document itself. (35o5-o35, at l). And\nit is quite obviously rough. The document contains numerous errors, including on material points.\n- Because the rough <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> is not a verbatim <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, lt cannot be offered as extrinsic\nevidence of prior inconsistent statements. See United States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, 29 (2d Cir.\nl992) (per curiam) (“[A] ‘third party’s characterization’ of a witness’s statement does not\nconstitute a prior statement of that witness unless the witness has subscribed to that\ncharacterization.”); United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, 757 (2d Cir. l98o) (FBI notes offered\nto impeach not atributable to witness because “‘a witness may not be charged with a third party’s\ncharacterization of his statements unless the witness has subscribed to them”); see also Ghailani,\n76l F.

But that has nothing to do with Dr. Hall, who, among other\nthings, was almost certainly not the reporter who transcribed that deposition.®\nOK OK\nIn addition to identifying no affirmative rule that allous Dr. Hall to offer hearsay about\nMinor Victim-4’s personal history, the defendant does not dispute that the most prejudicial\naspects of that history are independently barred by other rules of evidence. In particular, she\ndoes not disagree that the Court’s Rule 4l2 rulings apply to Dr. Hall. (Mot. l3-l4). She also\ndoes not dispute that none of PO satisfies Rules 4o4 or 6o9 (id.\nl2-l3), meaning that it is not a proper subject for Dr. Hall’s direct testimony or cross-examining\nMinor Victim-4.\nIV. Dr. Hall’s Fact Testimony Is Inadmissible\nWhether Dr. Hall can testify that Minor Victim-4’s statements to him contradict her trial\ntestimony is a dispute that cannot be resolved until Minor Victim-4 testifies. For nou, it suffices\nto point out three plain errors in the defendant’s opposition:\n® The defendant also argues that the defendant’s statements about her mental health conditions are\n“statements of her then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition” under Rule 8o3(3). By\nits plain terms, this exception does not reach any historical statements by Minor Victim-4, which\nare not statements of her condition at the time she was interviewed by Dr. Hall, and would in any\nevent be prohibited statements “of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.”\nFed.

United States v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo-ll (7th Cir. l987). As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained, this is particularly important in the context of documents likes FBI reports,\nthat are not necessarily verbatim transcription of the witness’s alleged statement:\n\nIf defense counsel had been reading from a <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of a previous trial or\n\ndeposition, there would have been no justification for the district judge's procedure.\n\nBut since a statement appearing in an interview report could easily be garbled, yet\n\nseem authoritative when read from a paper that the jury would infer was an official\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document558 Filed l2/l9/2l Page2of5\n\nAt the outset, it bears noting that the public interest in viewing the parties’ presentations is\nmarginal.

The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page5of7\nOrder, via email on or before February l6, 2o22. Because this Order resolves the scope of\nredactions for all filings related to the motion, the Court adjourns sine die the briefing schedule\npreviously set for the parties to justify any proposed sealing or redactions to the new trial motion\npapers. See Dkt. No. 585. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions so the filings can be\ndocketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which\nredactions are approved.\n\nAt the time the briefs are docketed with approved redactions, the Defendant is further\nORDERED to docket Exhibits 2 and 3 to her motion and the exhibit to her reply, and the\nGovernment ORDERED to docket all exhibits to its opposition, all of which are publicly\navailable documents.!\n\nI.

Defense Motion, at 5l-52; Government Response, at 44; see also\nDefense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22. The Court denies the motion. Juror 5o cites no authority to support\na juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention.

In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page9ofl3\nintervention in criminal cases by third parties who are seeking to prevent the wide dissemination\nof confidential or privileged information.

See Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. It should go without saying\nthat Juror 5o needs to knou whether or not the question(s) related to prior sexual abuse were\nanswered by him correctly on his Jury Questionnaire to help determine what an appropriate\ninquiry would entail, so that the same would also Juror 5o’s privacy rights and legitimate\ninterests related to these maters.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl3\n2s The Court has the authority to release the Jury Questionnaire\nunder seal.\n\nJuror 5o’s Jury Questionnaire and the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of his testimony during voir dire are\ncurrently held under seal, by this Court’s authority.\n\nIn United States v. King, the appellate court made clear that it may be permissible to\nrelease jury questionnaires from a trial, if the juror names were redacted to maintain juror\nanonymity. United States v. King, l4o F3d 76, 83 (2d Cir l998). Support for such a release was\nbased on the holding that limitations to access of voir dire materials are only permissible when\nthere is a demonstrated need, and the limitations are narrouly drawn and supported by findings.\nId., at 82-83.\n\nThe decision to release jury questionnaires and voir dire transcripts is subject to a\nbalancing test. United States v Bruno, 7oo F Supp 2d l75, l82-83 (NDNY 2olo). The Court\nmust use its discretion to “make a sensitive appraisal of the climate surrounding a trial and a\nprediction as to the potential security or publicity problems that may arise” before, during, and\nafter the proceedings. United States v. Childress, 58 F.3d 693, 7o2 (D.C.Cir.l995); see also\nUnited States v. Broun, 25o F.3d 9o7, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir.2ool) (holding that the trial court may\nrefuse to allou the media to inspect documents that are not a mater of public record and that\nsuch refusal does not operate as a prior restraint). The conclusion of the trial does not remove the\nJurors' interest in privacy and protection from harassment. See United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d\nl2o2, l2lo-l2 (Sth Cir.l977); see also United States v. Harrelson, 7l3 F.2d ll4, ll8 (Sth\nCir.l983) (finding that “[c]ommon sense tells us that a juror who has once indicated a desire to\nbe let alone and to put the mater of his jury service behind him by declining to be interviewed\nregarding it is unlikely to change his mind; and if he does, he is always free to initiate an\ninterview”).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl3\nBe The instance mater presents a compelling reason to release\nthe Jury Questionnaire to Counsel, under seal.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s privacy interest would normally prevent disclosure, those factors\ndo not apply to the release of the Jury Questionnaire and the voir dire <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, under seal, to\nhis oun atorney. Such a release will allou Juror 5o to comply with Judge Nathan’s Order from\nJanuary o5, 2o22. Additionally, since the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> will remain\nunder seal, with the limited expectations requested herein, this Court need not be concerned\nabout the risks that may be posed by full disclosure of the same, and therefore does not need to\nconsider the risks of widespread disclosure in deciding the instant motion.\n\nWhile the court was right to seal the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> from the\npublic given the circumstances of the trial, the circumstances have changes since that time.

The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6.

The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nback ground ll\neS\nee\nOO eee—C—CSSC\neC\neC\n\nee\neS\nee\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009062.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 6l of 66\nno legal effect). Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v.

This Court should strike all the filings made by Juror No. 5o.\n\nAlternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of\nMotion to Intervene and for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span>, on\nBehalf of Proposed Intervenor, Juror 5o” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at\nleast until a resolution of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure\nto answer truthfully during jury selection. Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v.

(Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “discovery request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaire would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\nquestionnaire, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun questionnaire.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun questionnaire as a\n“discovery request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking discovery.!® He is asking\nfor access to his questionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s questionnaire plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous circumstances.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt.

Relevant here is New York Rule 3.3(a) and (b), which provides:\n\n(a) A lawyer shall not knouingly: (l) make a false statement of fact or law to a\n\ntribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 66\nagain. /d. at l3. The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6l of 66\nno legal effect). Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v. Gibbons, No. 2:o8-CV-ol387-RLH-PA, 2olo WL 39loo72,\nat *3 (D. Nev. Sept. 3o, 2olo); see also Metzger v. Hussman, 682 F. Supp. llo9, llo\n(D. Nev. l988) (motion to strike granted and motion in opposition not considered by the\ncourt). This Court should strike all the filings made by Juror No. 5o.\n\nAlternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of\nMotion to Intervene and for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span>, on\nBehalf of Proposed Intervenor, Juror 5o” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at\nleast until a resolution of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure\nto answer truthfully during jury selection. Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v. The\nStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir.2ool) (rejecting claim that deposition testimony\nbecame a “judicial document” “because the Court reviewed it ln order to decide whether\nor not to enter [a] protective order’).\n\nThe fact that Juror No. 5o filed these pleadings does not make them “judicial\ndocuments.” United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995)\n(“We think that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 45 of 49\ninto the subject, by allouing [him] an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant\nissues.” (/d. at 7).\n\nIn his motion, Juror 5o’s counsel requested a copy of Juror 5o’s questionnaire, as well as\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of his testimony during voir dire. (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “discovery request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaire would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\nquestionnaire, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun questionnaire.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun questionnaire as a\n“discovery request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking discovery.!® He is asking\nfor access to his questionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s questionnaire plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous circumstances.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt. No. 585).\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009904.jpg": "CaSes8 2k OFeO CEES BOA n Baier aon 4o648 O (Fate RSL Pn Paka Sf a 767\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPAGE\nDocket Entries ..... o.o... teen eete eee eee ee eee Ae]\nIndictment—Redacted S3 2.o... eee  An84\nEmail from William Kermode to Adam Hollander and others,\n\nNovember 2, 2olo, ataching bill of particulars ..................

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28). And in any event, Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing demonstrated that\nthe sexual abuse he described experiencing is not particularly similar to the abuse experienced by\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\ncommercial flights. /d. at 3l6. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these\ntravel arrangements. /d. at 3l6-l7. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York\nand photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 32o.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with\nthe Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. /d. at 32l. In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.”” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent.

Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot.

Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A.

And Epstein’s escape from conviction through apparent suicide in\ncircumstances where federal authorities should have been more vigilant has created a widely spread\nmeme that “Epstein didn’t kill himself”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if Maxwell’s victims are prevented from speaking at her sentencing, it\nwill compound the public perception that the conspiracy’s victims are being silenced and that co—\nconspirators continue to receive favorable treatment. The best way to dispel this public perception is\nfor the Court to broadly permit a// Maxwell’s victims who wish to be heard at sentencing to speak.\n\nJudge Berman of this Court wisely recognized these realities in allouing all of Epstein’s\nvictims to speak at the court hearing where Epstein’s criminal charges were dismissed after his death.\nSee U.S. v. Epstein, Case No. l9-cr-49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. hearing <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> Aug. 27, 2ol9). As Judge\nBerman explained: “Public hearings are exactly what judges do.

See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through\nquestions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are — it will\nhave to be stopped.\nUnited States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), Dkt. No. l38 at l3; see also id. at l5. In that case,\nthe Government agreed that the line had to be carefully guarded. /d. at l3-l4. The <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.).

I posted FAQs on the EVCP website that address the scope and\nassurance of confidentiality. A copy of the EVCP FAQs is atached to the motion as Exhibit E\n(see Questions 5, 6 and ll). I also issued several press releases during the claims process that\nhighlight confidentiality as a “cornerstone” of the EVCP and of “paramount importance.”\nCopies of EVCP press releases are atached as Exhibits B, C, and F. Through numerous public\nforums, confidentiality was discussed as a centerpiece of the Program.\n\nll. The express condition of confidentiality significantly informed the way I\nadministered the Program and approached the claims process. I implemented a trauma-informed\nprocess where claimants could share information freely and openly without feeling the need to\ncensor themselves - not only about the events that gave rise to the claim but also the often\nprofound impact on their lives. I spent months building trust and confidence in this alternative\ndispute resolution process among claimants and their atorneys — a process that was new and\nunfamiliar to many of them. I dispensed with formal rules of procedure or evidence that would\napply in a court of law in favor of a less formal, non-adversarial approach.

The exhibits could\n2l corroborate several aspects of Jane's testimony, including that\n22 the room was the size of a giant walk-in closet, but space for\n23 a giant massage table in the middle of it.

In short, these photos have\n2 litle, if any, relevance and they're likely prejudicial\n\n3 because they are likely to confuse the jury.\n\n4 The four sets of photos that the government seeks to\n\na admit, photos 936 and 938, depict a room with a stuffed tiger\n\n6 and a stuffed dog. The government argues that these photos\n\n7 corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein's apartment\n\n8 contained, quote, creepy-looking animals and animal heads and\n\n9 strange things. Trial <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> at 3o5 to 3l8.\n\nlo I will exclude these photos, first, both the dog and\nll tiger are moveable items such that the photos taken in 2ol9\n\nl2 are, without additional testimony, not probative of what Jane\nl3 would have seen years earlier. Second, though Jane described\nl4 artwork of animals, she did not describe a stuffed dog or\n\nl5 tiger. The photos therefore have litle corroborative value,\nl6 even if, as the government argues, the dog and tiger are highly\nl7 idiosyncratic. And the photos are unfairly prejudicial because\nl8 they're likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that these\n\nl9 same items were in Epstein's apartment at the time that Jane\n2o was there. Further, the idiosyncratic nature of the items is\n2l likely to distract the jury, it could delay trial as the\n22 connection to Jane's testimony is tenuous at best.\n23 T'll note that, as I've said, the schoolgirl outfits\n24 found in the New York apartment in 2ol9 that the government\n25 intends to introduce, as I said on Friday, I anticipate these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o of 26l ll6o\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl (In open court)\n\n2 THE COURT: Anything else to take up?\n\n3 MR.

We had a chance to review the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> from\n6 last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that\n7 there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were\n8 not offered under seal but which contained identifying\n\n9 information for Jane, so we wanted to address that.

So this exhibit contains some\n\nl3 redactions, but there is additional identifying information as\nl4 to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would\nl5 propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted\n\nl6 version which would become Jl5R, and that Jl5 itself would\n\nl7 remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her\n\nl8 testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose\n\nl9 additional redactions, mark that, and make sure that that's in\n2o the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it\n2l stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal\n22 and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask\n23 that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.\n24 MS.

So the redactions we would propose\n\n3 would be substantial and perhaps beyond recognition in order to\n4 avoid that problem.\n\n5 For example, in a civil case in this district, if you\n6 were print out from ECF the full docket entry and it were a\n\n7 public document that had identifiers for the person who filed\n\n8 that civil suit, in order to redact it to make sure someone\n\n9 couldn't troll around PACER and find the public version, you\n\nlo would have to redact essentially everything, and that's the\n\nll problem here.

So simply being on the plane traveling does not\n\nl2 establish persuasion, inducement, or enticement.\n\nl3 And as to the last, occasionally arranging travel, if\nl4 that is to be believed, is not enticement either.

So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate foundation for expert opinion on suggestive\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked.

That's true for the Fifth\nll Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.\n\nl2 Second, the prior inconsistent statement must actually\nl3 be the witness's statement to shou an inconsistency. United\n\nl4 States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, (2d Cir. l992).\n\nl5 Where the defense relies on a third party's\n\nl6 characterization of the witness's words rather than a verbatim\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, then the witness must have subscribed to that\n\nl8 characterization. On that basis, notes taken in law\n\nl9 enforcement interviews will generally not prove an\n2o inconsistency for purposes of rule 6l3(b). See, for example,\n2l United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, the Gulani case and\n22 others.\n23 Of course, that infirmity is solved by calling the\n24 interviewing officer as a witness or to avoid calling another\n25 witness, the government stipulates to the accuracy of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of l97 2564\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl notes.\n\n2 Third, as I previously explained, testimony that a\n\n3 witness does not recall making a statement may be but is not\n\n4 necessarily a basis for inconsistency.\n\n5 Finally, I'll apply 4o3, consistent with my prior\n\n6 rulings of prior inconsistent statement has already been read\n\n7 in full into the record. I'll sustain the government's\n\n8 objection to admiting the statement as extrinsic evidence.\n\n9 See, for example, United States v. King, 56o F.2d l22\nlo (2d Cir. l977). Stating where evidence is admissible under\nll 6l3, it could be excluded under 4o3.\nl2 With that, we can turn to the list of the prior\nl3 statements and I'll do my best to apply that guidance I've just\nl4 given in light of the arguments raised by the parties and my\nl5 review of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>.\nl6 So beginning with Jane, <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> at 447, I will\nl7 overrule. Jane denied the statement in the handwriten notes,\nl8 which is an inconsistency, even if the later 3o2 corroborates\nl9 Jane's testimony. I will overrule that government objection.\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 455, I'll sustain the government's\n2l objection for two reasons. The full statement was read into\n22 the record and Jane responded it was, quote, correct, I guess,\n23 admiting the statement.\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 47o to 7l, overruled. Here the defense\n25 has adequately identified the statement at issue.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 24 of l97 2565\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 47l, sustained.

But I said in my ruling, in its brief, the defense\n\n5 seeks to affirmatively -- and I'll quote from the brief --\n\n6 \"call FBI case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to,\n7 what documents they subpoenaed, and when.\n\n8 But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga,\n\n9 the government's use or nonuse of certain investigative\n\nlo techniques does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of\nll the charges. That's <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> at page 2o. And I also said I\nl2 would permit the defense to cross-examine law enforcement\n\nl3 officers about the investigative steps that were taken if the\nl4 government puts the thoroughness of the investigation into\n\nl5 issue, as this too would be permissible impeachment on cross,\nl6 and they did not.\n\nl7 I suppose words have meaning in the eyes of the\n\nl8 beholder, but what you're suggesting is directly contrary to my\nl9 ruling.\n2o MR.

Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other\npersonal identifying information.” The Department will work with the United States Atorney’s\nOffice for Southern District of New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related\ninformation and other personal identifying information prior to releasing the transcripts.\nTransparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect\nvictims.\n\nl. On July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York returned\nan indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See United States v. Epstein, l:l9-\ncr-49o, Dkt. No. 2. (S.D.N.Y.). On August lo, 2ol9, while awaiting trial, Epstein commited\nsuicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. Soon after, the Court\ndismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52.\n\n2. On June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in the Southern District of New York charged\nEpstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking\nand coercion of minors. See Dkt. No. l. In December 2o2l, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several\ncounts. This Court sentenced Maxwell to 24o months’ imprisonment and the Second Circuit later\naffirmed her convictions and sentence. See United States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nDe On July 6, 2o25, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation\nannounced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since\nthen, the public’s interest in the Epstein mater has remained. Given this longstanding and\nlegitimate interest, the government nou moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with\nEpstein.\n\n2 The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v. Epstein, l:l9-cr-49o (S.D.N.Y,), and in the\nSouthern District of Florida.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 785 Filed o7/l8/25 Page3of4\n\n4. “Tt is a tradition of law that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain\nsecret.” In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. l973). “[T]he tradition of secrecy,” houever, “is not\nabsolute.” Jn re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d 625, 628 (S.D.N-Y. 2ol5). Although\nRule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand\njury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in\nwhich release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d Cir. l997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th\nCir. 2ol6) (“Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent pouer. It merely identifies a permissive\nlist of situations where that pouer can be used.’’). One such “special circumstance” is historical\ninterest by the public. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo5. Under Jn re Craig, this Court retains discretion\nto determine “whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and\nsecrecy[.]” Jd.\n\n=A Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested\nand concerned about the Epstein mater. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts\nafter concluding that Epstein’s case qualifies as a mater of public concern. See Order Granting\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s February 29, 2o24 Order, CA Florida\nHoldings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph Abruzzo, 5o-2ol9 CA-ol468l (l5th Cir. July l,\n2o24).° After all, Jeffrey Epstein is “the most infamous pedophile in American history.” /d. The\nfacts surrounding Epstein’s case “tell a tale of national disgrace.” Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d l244, l247\n(llth Cir. 2o2l) (discussing the plea agreement secured by Epstein in Florida). The grand jury\nrecords are thus “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Jn re Petition of\nNat. Sec. Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 629. “The time for the public to guess what they contain\n3 htps://www.mypalmbeachclerk.com/home/shoupublisheddocument/4l94/6385544237lol7oooo.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 785 _ Filed o7/l8/25 Page4of4\nshould end.” /d. Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are\nsubstantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of\nJustice will work with the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nto redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release. While the Government recognizes\nthat Maxwell’s case is currently pending before the Supreme Court on a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, it nonetheless moves this Court for relief due to the intense public scrutiny into this\nmater.\n\n6.

Maxwell, Case No. 2o-Cr-33o\nDear Judge Engelmayer:\n\nOn behalf of MSW Media, Inc. (“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this leter motion\nto intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially\nopposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case,\nfiled as Docket No. 785.\n\nMSW Media (htps://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about\nfederal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It\nclearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.\n\nMSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the follouing reason. On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. l9-49o (S.D.N.Y.). We are\nconcerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,\nsuch as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join\nthe Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrou\nindependent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding\npersonally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this FOTA request\nif necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly withheld is a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page 2 of lo\n\nl. Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page3oflo\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure; (ll) whether the\ndefendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\nthe disclosure; (i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular\ncase; (iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi) the\ncurrent status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that\nof their families; (vi) the extent to which the desired material—\neither permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously made\npublic; (vi) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who\nmight be affected by disclosure are still alive; and (ix) the additional\nneed for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nIn re Craig, l33 F.3d at lo6.\n\nOn July 22, 2o25, the Court directed the Government to file a memorandum of law\n“addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as germane to\nits application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). The Court also directed the\nGovernment to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, counsel for the Government\nreviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government provided notice to the\nvictims of the motion to unseal,” and to submit: (l) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand jury\nmaterials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of the\nEpstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein\nand Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits.

The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. /n re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can\ngovernment opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n? See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page5oflo\nnature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the\nunderlying proceedings.\n\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page6oflo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page 7 oflo\n6. The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.

Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by disclosure are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\ndetective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\nDetective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

Additional Information\n\nThe Court directed the Government to state whether, “before filing the instant motion,\ncounsel for the Government reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the\nGovernment provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3;\nMaxwell Dkt. 789 at 3).\n\nBefore filing the motions to unseal, relevant counsel for the Government reviewed the\nEpstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts. In addition, the Government has nou provided notice\nto all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at issue in this\nmotion. The Government has atempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have\nbeen unsuccessful. In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other\nindividuals identified in the transcripts.\n\nC. Provision of Materials to the Court\n\nThe Court directed the Government to submit: (l) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of\nthe Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein\nand Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at\n3). As to the final category, the Government provides a description of all of the underlying\nmaterials presented to the grand jury as well as copies of, and proposed redactions to, certain\nmaterials presented to the grand jury.\n\nThe Government is submiting these materials ex parte and under seal, as they relate to\ngrand jury proceedings and include information related to victims, including but not limited to\nvictim-identifying information of individuals who neither testified at trial or who were the subject\nof testimony at trial.

(Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nIn particular, on July l8, 2o25, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury\ntranscripts from these cases, subject to appropriate redactions. (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785). The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63;\nMaxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submited on July 29, 2o25 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell\nDkt. 796).

Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed disclosure, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo Filed o8/o5/25 Page3of4\nHon. Richard M. Berman, U.S.D_J.\nHon. Paul A.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed disclosure.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of4\n\nHon.

Engelmayer, U.S.D.J.\n\nAugust 4, 2o25\n\nPage 4 of 4\naffirmed l47 F.2d 336 (Sth Cir. l945) (“The same jurisdiction that was sought in the beginning\ncontinues to exist insofar as the integrity and preservation of the minutia and minutes and\nproceedings of those steps are concerned. What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged\nby either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.\nAnd the only jurisdiction over such maters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

As a result, Ghislaine Maxwell has not seen the material and cannot take\nan informed position. Given that she is actively litigating her case and does not knou\nwhat is in the grand jury record, she has no choice but to respectfully oppose the\ngovernment’s motion to unseal it.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nJeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not. Whatever interest the\npublic may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand\njury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and\nher due process rights remain.\n\nWhen Epstein died, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York\npivoted and made Maxwell the face of his crimes. She became the scapegoat and the\nonly person the government could put on trial. She was convicted in a media\nfirestorm of false reporting and mischaracterization of evidence. Nou, with her case\npending before the Supreme Court, the government seeks to unseal untested,\n\nLERETE MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page2of9\nhearsay-laden grand jury transcripts, which contain statements presented in secret\nand never challenged by the adversarial process. Maxwell has never been alloued to\nreview those transcripts even though the government did not oppose her recent\nrequest to do so.\n\nThe government seeks to unseal the grand jury transcripts, citing “historical\ninterest” without regard for hou that release will affect Maxwell’s privacy interests,\nher pending Petition, and any future litigation. The government’s Memorandum\n(Dkt. 796) cloaks itself in Jn re Craig, but that case emphasized that disclosure\nrequires the most careful judgment and that “the public's curiosity in a defendant’s\nsecret conduct at a grand jury hearing cannot eclipse the right the defendant has to\nsecrecy and overwhelm his objection to public discourse.” l3l F.3d 99, lo5 (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\nBecause this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.\n\nTl. THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO ESTABLISH “SPECIAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES” WARRANTING DISCLOSURE OF GRAND\nJURY MATERIALS IN AN ONGOING CASE\n\nThere is a tradition in the United States that is “older than the Nation itself,”\nthat grand jury proceedings shall remain secret. In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2\n(quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir.l973)). This tradition of secrecy is\ncodified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The rule of secrecy is not without\nexceptions, houever, and Rule 6(e)(8) lists several exceptions. The Second Circuit\nhas additionally recognized that there are certain “special circumstances” in which\n\nLSRETE MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015091.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of9\nwhen Maxwell’s legal and reputational interests are at stake. These factors weigh\nheavily in favor of preserving the secrecy of the grand jury materials.\n\nAlthough the government’s memorandum sets forth that certain “aspects and\nsubject maters of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> became public during Maxwell’s trial,” Maxwell has\nnever had an opportunity to review the entirety of the grand jury materials in her\ncase. Dkt 796 at 7. The government provided a list to the Court, under seal, of\nwitnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury and a corresponding list\nnoting which witnesses testified at trial. That list has not been disclosed to us. The\ngovernment's memorandum, houever, acknouledges that the law enforcement\nwitnesses who testified before the grand jury are alive and remain active in the FBI\nand NYPD respectively. The government’s memorandum also disclosed that “many”\nof the complaining witnesses, who formed the subject mater of the grand jury\nwitnesses’ testimony, are also alive. Dkt 796 at 8. This factor likewise counsels\nagainst disclosure of the grand jury transcripts given the need to protect both active\nlaw enforcement personnel and alleged victims.\n\nIll. THERE IS NO PRECEDENT SUPPORTING RELEASE OF GRAND\nJURY TRANSCRIPTS IN A PENDING CASE LIKE THIS ONE\n\nNone of the cases cited by the government justify disclosure here.

Epstein, l9-cr-49o (RMB) and U.S. v.\nMaxwell, 2o-cr-33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,\n\nWe write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from\nthe Department of Justice on July 25, 2o25, advising that the Court is seeking leters on behalf of\nvictims seting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!\n\nBy the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s actions. To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n'Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n* Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page9of27\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3—7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page lo of 27\nBSF\nA. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Pagellof27\nBSF\n, affirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\n\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l2 of 27\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\nae oe\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

Ghislaine Maxwell,\n2o Cr. 33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer:\n\nThe Government writes respectfully to respond to Judge Engelmayer’s Order dated August\n5, 2o25, and Judge Berman’s Order dated August 6, 2o25.\n\nIn addition to seeking to unseal the grand jury transcripts, the Government moves to unseal\nthe Maxwell and Epstein grand jury exhibits subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and\nother personal identifying information. As there are parties whose names appear in the grand jury\nexhibits but did not appear in the grand jury transcripts, the Government is undertaking to notify\nsuch parties to the extent their names appear in grand jury exhibits that were not publicly admited\nat the Maxwell trial (and they were not already notified in connection with the request to unseal\nthe grand jury transcripts). The Government respectfully requests to update the Court follouing\nthose notifications by August l4, 2o25, and requests that the Court await that update before\nunsealing any of the grand jury exhibits, to the extent the Court is otherwise inclined to do so.\n\nIn conjunction with this leter, the Government will submit sealed, ex parte submissions\nclarifying which portions of the grand jury exhibits in the Maxwell and Epstein maters have been\nmade public. In making this assessment, the Government has compared the grand jury exhibits\nagainst the trial record and exhibits in the Maxwell trial, as well as against any publicly filed civil\ncomplaints identified by the Government that were filed by certain victims, as explained in further\ndetail in the Government’s sealed, ex parte submissions. !\n\n' Many civil complaints were filed in federal and state courts on behalf of victims identified solely\n\nas “Jane Doe” or by initials that may or may not be the initials of the plaintiffs in those actions,\n\nand therefore the Government cannot atribute with certainty to whom the statements or allegations\n\nin those anonymized complaints can be atributed. If the Government identifies additional\n\nmaterials on public dockets that make such atribution possible, it promptly will notify the Court.\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o8 _ Filed o8/o8/25 Page 2 of 2\nHon.

Indictments\n\nIn late November 2ol8, prompted by investigative journalism, the United States Atorney\nin this District opened an investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators. On July 2, 2ol9, a\ngrand jury returned an indictment that charged Epstein with participating in a sex trafficking\nconspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) and (b).? On July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested.\n' A motion seeking, on similar terms, the unsealing of grand jury materials in Epstein’s case is\npending before the Hon. Richard M. Berman.

Motion to Unseal the Maxwell Grand Jury Materials\n\nOn July l8, 2o25, the Deputy Atorney General (“DAG”) filed a three-and-a-half-page\nmotion to unseal the grand jury transcripts in this case. Dkt. 785 (“Motion to Unseal’”’).’ The\nmotion stated:\n\nOn July 6, 2o25, the [DOJ] and [FBI] issued a memorandum describing an\n\nexhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n(the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the [DOJ]\n\nand [FBI] to determine whether evidence existed that could predicate an\n\ninvestigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, no such\n\nevidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\n\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the\n\nconclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is\n\nof the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the\n\ninvestigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]\n\nmoves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.\n\nMaxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-\n\nrelated and other personal identifying information.\n\nId.

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'! The Court hereinafter refers to the grand jury transcripts and exhibits together as the “grand\njury materials.”\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l6 of 3l\n\nThe Government’s invocation of special circumstances, houever, fails at the threshold.\nIts entire premise—that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new\ninformation about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the Government’s investigation into\nthem—is demonstrably false.\n\nThe Court, after receiving the Government’s motion to unseal, ordered it to provide\nmaterials to substantiate its claim that the Maxwell grand jury materials contained undisclosed\ninformation of significant historical or public interest. Specifically, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to submit the grand jury transcripts and exhibits for in camera review, with the\nportions the Government proposed to redact highlighted. And it ordered the Government to file\na submission identifying the portions of the transcripts and exhibits, if any, that are not today\nmaters of public record, including based on Maxwell’s month-long jury trial on the charges\nreturned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government’s submissions in response to the Court’s orders were telling. They\nbelied the Government’s claim, in its motion to unseal, that the Maxwell grand jury materials\ncontain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the\ninvestigation into them. Two features of these materials, which were not disclosed in the\nGovernment’s motion, are noteworthy. The Court reports these here, at a level of generality that\ndoes not disclose the substance of grand jury proceedings.\n\nFirst, the grand juries in this case were not used for investigative purposes. They did not\nhear testimony from any firsthand witness to any event at issue. They did not hear testimony\nfrom any victim, eyewitness, suspect, or even a records custodian. The grand juries met instead\nfor the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel7 of 3l\nEach grand jury received evidence on a single day. On that day, it heard testimony from\none person: a law enforcement agent who, acting as a summary witness, testified to information\nobtained in the Government’s investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.\nThe agent, responding to tightly structured questions from an Assistant United States Atorney\n(“AUSA”), provided highly abbreviated, hearsay accounts of the statements of select witnesses\n(e.g., the victims on whom counts in the proposed indictment were based).\"4 The agent led the\njury through a PouerPoint of exhibits (e.g., photographs and business records). At the end of the\ntestimony, the agent testified that he or she had not disclosed all that he or she knew, but had\nonly responded to the AUSA’s questions. Afterwards, each grand jury voted to return the\nproposed indictment.»\n‘4 Under federal law, “[i]t is entirely permissible for the government to use hearsay evidence in\nits presentation to the grand jury.” United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(quoting United States v. Ruggiero, 934 F.2d 44o, 447 (2d Cir. l99l)); see also United States v.\nDukagjini, 326 F.3d 45, 54 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (noting the common “grand jury practice, improper at\ntrial, of a single agent simply summarizing an investigation by others’).\n'S The first Maxwell grand jury met on June 29, 2o2o. It heard testimony from an FBI special\nagent. The agent’s testimony lasted approximately one hour and 25 minutes, spanning 74\ndouble-spaced <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> pages. Two exhibits were put before the grand jury: a PouerPoint\ncontaining slides referred to during the agent’s testimony; and the proposed indictment of\nMaxwell. The same grand jury briefly met again on July 8, 2o2o, for the purpose of returning\nthe “Sl” superseding indictment, which corrected two typographical errors in the indictment.\nCompare Dkt. l7, with Dkt. l. The grand jury did not receive additional evidence.\nThe second Maxwell grand jury met on March 29, 2o2l. It heard testimony from a New York\nPolice Department detective. The detective’s testimony lasted approximately an hour and 48\nminutes, not including a brief recess, and spanned ll7 double-spaced <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> pages. Nearly\ntwo-thirds of the testimony consisted of reading into the record the special agent’s June 29, 2o2o\ntestimony. Six exhibits were put before the grand jury: the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of the June 29, 2o2o grand\njury testimony; the PouerPoint put before the June 29, 2o2o grand jury; a new PouerPoint with\nfurther exhibits; the two earlier indictments of Maxwell; and the proposed “S2” superseding\nindictment.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l8 of 3l\n\nSecond, the evidence put before the Maxwell grand juries is today, with only very minor\nexceptions, a mater of public record. The Government admited as much in response to the\nCourt’s order: “The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of the information provided\nduring the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the identities of certain\nwitnesses—was made publicly available at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly\nreported through the public statements of victims and witnesses.” Dkt. 8oo at 3. And because\nthe Government proposes to redact the witnesses’ identities, the exception it noted does not\nreflect information that the public would learn were the grand jury transcripts unsealed.\n\nThe Court’s review confirmed that unsealing the grand jury materials would not reveal\nnew information of any consequence. In response to the Court’s order, the Government supplied\nthe Court with a binder highlighting any information that the Government had been unable to\ndetermine is public. Only scatered words, clauses, and occasional sentences are highlighted.\nThese items are few and far between.'® The highlighted snippets supply, at most, tertiary details\nabout the same conduct that was the focus of Maxwell’s month-long trial. The same is so for the\nexhibits put before the grand juries. Save inconsequential portions of a few exhibits, these were\nreceived in evidence at Maxwell’s trial. Some were reproduced in the Maxwell indictments.\n\nA member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial record who reviewed the grand\njury materials that the Government proposes to unseal would thus learn next to nothing new.\n\nThe materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual\ncontact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s.\nThey do not reveal any heretofore unknoun means or methods of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s crimes.\n‘6 And the Government’s highlighting is significantly over-inclusive: On the Court’s review of\nthe trial record, a number of items highlighted in fact were covered by testimony at Maxwell’s\ntrial.\n\nl8\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel9 of 3l\nThey do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources\nof their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein’s death. They do not reveal\nthe path of the Government’s investigation.\n\nInsofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine\nlode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are\nnot that. A “public official,” “lawmaker,” “pundit,” or “ordinary citizen” “deeply interested and\nconcerned about the Epstein mater,” Motion to Unseal at 3, and who reviewed these materials\nexpecting, based on the Government’s representations, to learn new information about Epstein’s\nand Maxwell’s crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed\nand misled. There is no “there” there.\n\nThis case is thus a far cry from every reported case applying the Second Circuit’s\n“special circumstances” doctrine. In each such case, the petition to unseal, whether granted or\ndenied, sought unique, undisclosed information. That information generally consisted of\nfirsthand testimony from a public figure or a witness to an important event. See, e.g., In re\nBiaggi, 478 F.2d at 49o-9l (granting petition to unseal grand jury testimony of New York City\nmayoral candidate Mario Biaggi); /n re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol (denying petition to unseal l948\ngrand jury testimony of Harry Dexter White, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury accused of\nbeing a Communist spy); /n re Petition of Nat’l Sec.

Hist. Ass’n for Order Directing Release of Grand Jury Minutes,\n49 F. Supp. 274, 278, 297-98 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (“dn re AHA”’’) (granting in part and denying in\npart petition to unseal transcripts of l947—l95o grand jury testimony regarding alleged espionage\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 23 of 3l\n\nFirst, as the Second Circuit has explained, the Government’s position is mainly relevant\nbecause it reflects whether there is an ongoing need for grand jury secrecy. See In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6 (where “the government supports a motion for disclosure, that should serve as a\npreliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong”). But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under circumstances suggestive of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial. See note l6,\nsupra,\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 25 of 3l\ntestimony of mayoral candidate exposing as false his representation to the public that he had\nanswered all questions before grand jury). And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 28 of 3l\n9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information.

And she says that at some point\n2o \"Ghislaine made it happen for me,\" meaning that she helped her\n2l get on that flight.\n22 That's the only testimony we have and only evidence we\n23 have in the record that talks about Ms. Maxwell's involvement\n24 in enticement or encouraging travel to New York.

There's no enticement as would be illegal\n\n7 under the statute there because this is a return trip.\n\n8 As to the first, simply traveling with someone is not\n9 enticing; that's just being present on the plane, that's not\n\nlo causing an effect, that's being present. That does not\n\nll qualify. So simply being on the plane traveling does not\n\nl2 establish persuasion, inducement, or enticement.\n\nl3 And as to the last, occasionally arranging travel, if\nl4 that is to be believed, is not enticement either. Jane's\n\nl5 testimony, if you look at those <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> cites, your Honor,\nl6 is that her travel arrangements were typically made by Jeffrey\nl7 Epstein's office, and that Ghislaine Maxwell occasionally\n\nl8 helped out.\n\nl9 There is no testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\n2o Maxwell encouraged her to travel. There is no testimony that\n2l she tried to convince her to travel anywhere, much less New\n22 York, or advised her to travel. We don't even have testimony\n23 that Ghislaine Maxwell offered to arrange the travel.\n24 All it says is that she occasionally arranged.

The government argues that the above two opinions,\n3 houever, lack a foundation in the record. I'm going to deny\n\n4 the government's motion to preclude here, but with guidance.\n\niy First, as we've discussed and I've made clear, Dr.\n\n6 Loftus is testifying, I understand, as a blind expert, meaning\n7 that she'll provide relevant expert opinion, but not apply it\n\n8 to the facts of the case. And just as Dr. Rocchio offered\n\n9 testimony that included examples of grooming, variety of\n\nlo grooming examples or factors that might make a child vulnerable\nll to sexual abuse, it seems comparable to me that Dr. Loftus can\nl2 offer examples of suggestive activity, including the two\n\nl3 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her\n\nl4 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this\nl5 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond\nl6 the bounds of a blind expert.\n\nl7 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided\nl8 an adequate foundation for expert opinion on suggestive\n\nl9 questioning by the government by cross-examining witnesses\n2o about the questions they were asked. For example, the defense\n2l on cross-examination of Jane asked about the government asking\n22 her the same question three times in the same interview, trial\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> at 5l5.

That's true for the Fifth\nll Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.\n\nl2 Second, the prior inconsistent statement must actually\nl3 be the witness's statement to shou an inconsistency. United\n\nl4 States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, (2d Cir. l992).\n\nl5 Where the defense relies on a third party's\n\nl6 characterization of the witness's words rather than a verbatim\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, then the witness must have subscribed to that\n\nl8 characterization. On that basis, notes taken in law\n\nl9 enforcement interviews will generally not prove an\n2o inconsistency for purposes of rule 6l3(b). See, for example,\n2l United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, the Gulani case and\n22 others.\n23 Of course, that infirmity is solved by calling the\n24 interviewing officer as a witness or to avoid calling another\n25 witness, the government stipulates to the accuracy of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool675l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of l97 2564\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl notes.\n\n2 Third, as I previously explained, testimony that a\n\n3 witness does not recall making a statement may be but is not\n\n4 necessarily a basis for inconsistency.\n\n5 Finally, I'll apply 4o3, consistent with my prior\n\n6 rulings of prior inconsistent statement has already been read\n\n7 in full into the record. I'll sustain the government's\n\n8 objection to admiting the statement as extrinsic evidence.\n\n9 See, for example, United States v. King, 56o F.2d l22\nlo (2d Cir. l977). Stating where evidence is admissible under\nll 6l3, it could be excluded under 4o3.\nl2 With that, we can turn to the list of the prior\nl3 statements and I'll do my best to apply that guidance I've just\nl4 given in light of the arguments raised by the parties and my\nl5 review of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>.\nl6 So beginning with Jane, <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> at 447, I will\nl7 overrule.

There were a number of\n\nl3 points during defense counsel's summations where they referred\nl4 to facts which are not in evidence and testified to things\n\nl5 which are not in evidence. And for that reason, we would\n\nl6 respectfully request that the Court give a curative\n\nl7 instruction, essentially in reminding the jurors that it's\n\nl8 their recollection of the evidence that controls and not what\nl9 the lawyers say.\n2o I think, in particular, there is one example, I\nal believe Ms. Menninger read into the record an email from Kate\n22 which the Court expressly precluded and which is not in\n23 evidence.\n24 THE COURT: What exhibit?\n25 MS.

Our concern was that there\nl8 were a number of items throughout the closing that were\n\nl9 mischaracterizations of testimony or inaccurate or references\n2o to items that were not in evidence. That's why we're\n2l requesting it nou, although I understand the Court's point that\n22 the jury will be charged this afternoon and that language is in\n23 the charge.\n24 The second issue that we wanted to raise is, as the\n25 Court will recall from pretrial litigation, we moved to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017180.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l59 of 257 2993\nLCKCmax7\n\nl preclude any arguments to the jury that the defendant was a\n\n2 substitute for Jeffrey Epstein.

We had a chance to review the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> from\n6 last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that\n7 there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were\n8 not offered under seal but which contained identifying\n\n9 information for Jane, so we wanted to address that. We\n\nlo conferred with defense about that.\n\nll Taking those exhibits in order, the first is\n\nl2 Defendant's Exhibit Jl5. So this exhibit contains some\n\nl3 redactions, but there is additional identifying information as\nl4 to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would\nl5 propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted\n\nl6 version which would become Jl5R, and that Jl5 itself would\n\nl7 remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her\n\nl8 testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose\n\nl9 additional redactions, mark that, and make sure that that's in\n2o the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it\n2l stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal\n22 and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask\n23 that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.\n24 MS.

So the redactions we would propose\n\n3 would be substantial and perhaps beyond recognition in order to\n4 avoid that problem.\n\n5 For example, in a civil case in this district, if you\n6 were print out from ECF the full docket entry and it were a\n\n7 public document that had identifiers for the person who filed\n\n8 that civil suit, in order to redact it to make sure someone\n\n9 couldn't troll around PACER and find the public version, you\n\nlo would have to redact essentially everything, and that's the\n\nll problem here.

Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\nHampshire.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\ncharacter and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” Jd.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.

It obscures the\nrelief Ms. Maxwell actually seeks, and it confuses the arguments she actually\nmakes.\n\nAs to the relief she seeks, Ms. Maxwell’s request is specific and narrou: She\nseeks permission to share relevant information, under seal, with other Article III\njudicial officers, specifically Judge Preska and the panel of this Court deciding the\nappeal of Judge Preska’s order unsealing the civil deposition material, Gzuffre v.\nMaxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Only by obscuring what Ms. Maxwell actually seeks can the\ngovernment claim with a straight face that this appeal won’t be moot if this Court\ndeclines to exercise jurisdiction nou.\n\nAs to the arguments she makes, there are several (fairly obvious) reasons\nwhy Judge Preska and this Court should knou just hou prosecutors obtained the\ndeposition material and who turned it over to them. If Judge Preska knew this\ninformation, she might very well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntranscripts to protect Ms. Maxwell’s ability in the criminal case to litigate the\ngovernment’s violation of Martindell v. International Telephone & Telegraph Corp.,\n594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), cited with approval in In re Teligent, Inc., 64o F.3d 53, 58\n(2d Cir. 2oll). She might also reconsider whether Ms. Maxwell reasonably relied\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool965o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019654.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Pages of 23\npublic.* Op.Br. l6. (distinguishing United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23 (2d Cir.\nl986)).\n\nThe government argues that Ms. Maxwell can wait until after the criminal\ntrial to challenge whether, for example, Judge Preska’s unsealing decisions produce\nunfair pretrial publicity in the criminal case. But a panel of this Court considering\nan appeal in the criminal case presided over by Judge Nathan won’t have any\njurisdiction to review orders entered by Judge Preska in the civil case. The time for\nreviewing Judge Preska’s unsealing order in the civil case is right nou in the appeal\nof Judge Preska’s order, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3.\n\nThe government also argues that, in a post-trial appeal, Ms. Maxwell can\nchallenge the government’s conduct in obtaining Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntranscripts and the use of those transcripts as a basis for two perjury counts.\n\n* This Court should accordingly reject the government’s argument that “[t]o\nthe extent Maxwell still wishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\ndiscovery for other purposes after entry of final judgment in the criminal case, she\ncan seek authorization from this Court to do so then.” Ans.Br. l7.\n\nSimilarly, the government misunderstands the relief Ms. Maxwell seeks\nwhen it contends that “[i]f Maxwell complains that her inability to use criminal\ndiscovery materials in civil maters may result in premature unsealing ..., she\ncan... raise [that] claim[] before this Court on appeal after entry of final judgment\nin her criminal case.” Ans.Br. l7. A post-final-judgment appeal will do no good\nbecause there is no way to “re-seal” material already unsealed and no way to\nretroactively stay an unsealing process that is largely if not entirely complete.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9654\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019655.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Page of 23\nAns.Br. l8. But as Ms. Maxwell explained in her opening brief, if Judge Preska\norders the deposition transcripts unsealed, the government will invoke Judge\nPreska’s order as a shield against its improper conduct. Op.Br. 27-28, 3o. The\ngovernment will argue that it would have inevitably discovered Ms. Maxwell’s\ndeposition transcripts or that any improper conduct on its part was ultimately\nharmless. Op.Br. 3o. Conspicuously, the government in the answer brief never\ndenies that it will make such an argument. Ans.Br. l8 & n.4.\n\nThe government responds that if Ms. Maxwell “is concerned that unsealing\nwill open up an inevitable discovery argument for the Government, she can explain\nto Judge Nathan when making a suppression motion hou an unsealing decision\nwould have been altered by revelation of criminal discovery materials to the\nunsealing court.” Ans.Br. l8. This is fanciful thinking.\n\nIf this Court affirms Judge Preska’s decision unsealing the deposition\nmaterial, Judge Nathan likely will not (cannot?) reject an inevitable discovery\nargument from the government. Judge Nathan is not going to second-guess Judge\nPreska’s decision to unseal the deposition material if this Court affirms its release.\nThis, of course, explains why the government has not moved to intervene in Giuffre\nyp. Maxwell, No. l5-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.), to stay the unsealing process, or to oppose\nthe unsealing of the deposition material.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v.

No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access.

The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test.

If no such Notice is filed, the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>\nmay be made remotely electronically available to the public without redaction after 9o\ncalendar days.... (McGuirk, Kelly) (Entered: l2/lo/2o2o)\n\nl2/l4/2o2o 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

(McGuirk, Kelly) (Entered: l2/lo/2o2o)\n\nl2/l4/2o2o 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After\ndue consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in\nquestion are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common law\npresumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's leter motions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978).\nNevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed\nthe brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the\nCourt's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See\nDkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre\nv. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv—7433, Dkt. No. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees\nno basis to file the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant\nportions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket\non ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file\na leter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding\npages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2o2l. The\nparties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the\nDefendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March\n22, 2o2l.

The Court also noted that\nwhile it was concerned about Mr. Robertson’s ability to meet with his atorneys to prepare for trial\nduring the pandemic, it had been informed that the defense team would be able to meet in\nconference rooms in the federal courthouse in Albuquerque.

See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

Not a single one of the\nanonymous accusers will be able to corroborate the 25-year old stories of\nthe other accusers. Indeed, their stories are contradictory, not\ncorroborating.

This is an adversary system, of course. But\nwhen the government’s representations about the conditions of\nconfinement continue to be demonstrably and admitedly false, there\nneeds to be an intervention.

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

See\nDkt. No. 38o. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general\ndescription of evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to\nprotect the privacy interests of the individuals implicated.

Before the Court is\nthe Defendant's fourth motion in limine to \"exclude evidence related to Accuser—3,\" to\nwhom the Court refers as Witness—3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of\nEvidence 4o4(b) and 4o3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument\nrelated to this motion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing\nthat was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,\naccompanying exhibits, and their January l3 leters, by February 25, 2o22. The Court\nwill docket Juror 5o's motion. As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly\nunsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that\nJuror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.\nThe Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire and a copy of\nthis Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the\nquestioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the\nGovernment.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249.

Nathan\non 6/25/2o2l)(bw) (Entered: o6/25/2o2l)\n\no6/25/2o2l | 3o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. l33, l39) (Signed by Judge Alison\nJ. Nathan on 6/25/2l)(Gw) (Entered: o7/ol/2o2l)\n\no6/3o/2o2l | 3o5 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2o2l (Dkt.\nNo. 3o3), any proposed redactions to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to\nsuppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 3o, 2o2l.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty.

Before the Court is\nthe Defendant's fourth motion in limine to \"exclude evidence related to Accuser—3,\" to\nwhom the Court refers as Witness—3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of\nEvidence 4o4(b) and 4o3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument\nrelated to this motion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing\nthat was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l\n<span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span>; Nov. lo, 2o2l <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span>. At the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court\nprovided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then\nbefore it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The\nCourt is nou in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to\nresolve the motion.(See Footnote l on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The\nGovernment nou proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness—3 will describe\nhou she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.\nIn particular, Witness—3 is anticipated to testify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr.\nEpstein, hou massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role\nin facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information nou before the Court,\nincluding a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated\ntestimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43,\nthe Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct\nevidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order\n***].

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-l426\nDear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe,\n\nIam appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell. I was not trial counsel\nfor Ms. Maxwell. I filed an Acknouledgement and Notice of Appearance on July l5, 2o22. The\nClerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any\ninformation concerning the transcripts.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), the ready date for this case was July l5, 2o22.\nAccordingly, I have until July 29, 2o22, to file this briefing schedule request. Pursuant to Local\nRule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), I can request no more than 9l days from the ready date as the deadline for\nfiling Appellant’s Brief. That date would be October l4, 2o22.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(D), houever, I am permited to request a later deadline\nto file Appellant’s Brief ifthe case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.\nI request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 3o, 2o23, for the\nfollouing reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions identified by the rule. First, as noted,\nI am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week. As\nnew counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to\nprovide my client with the most competent and effective representation on appeal. Second, the\nrecord is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> including pretrial hearings,\nvoir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists\nof 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in\nlimine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct\nmy oun research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance\nof prevailing on appeal. This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size\nof Appellant’s Brief. Fourth, I have not been able to meet with my client as she was prematurely\ntransferred to Tallahassee, Florida by the Federal Bureau of Prisons over this past weekend, a\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020601.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 38-2, ol/o5/2o23, 3447678, Pagel of l\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nCRIMINAL APPEAL <span class=\"highlight\">TRANSCRIPT</span> INFORMATION - FORM B\nTO BE COMPLETED BY ATTORNEY:\nCASE NAME: USA v\nMaxwell\nDOCKET NUMBER: 22-l426\nCOUNSEL’s ADDREss: o46 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor\nNew York, New York loo36\nCOUNSEL’S PHONE: (2l2) 486-ooll\nQUESTIONNAIRE\n____ | am ordering a <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> -\n¥ ‘Tam not ordering a <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> Reason Daily copy available = US Aty placed order\n__ Other (atach explanation)\n<span class=\"highlight\">TRANSCRIPT</span> ORDER\nPrepare <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> of\nPre-trial proceedings a  —\n(Description & Dates)\nTrial\n(Description & Dates)\n__.

The\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> is over 3ooo pages and contains the allegations of multiple complainants. The legal\nissues cannot be raised by reference to a few discrete pages of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>; rather they go to\ncumulative prejudice resulting from the trial court’s erroneous application of the Federal Rules\nof Evidence to the case.\n\nlo. In addition, we plan to raise issues pertaining to juror misconduct. This issue\ninvolves an exposition of facts and legal analysis pertaining to a juror questionnaire, voir dire,\nand a post-verdict hearing. It is, in itself, its oun mini-trial.\n\nll. We also intend to raise issues pertaining to a non-prosecution agreement; certain\ninstructions to the jury; and sentencing.\n\nl2. _A motion to file an oversized brief must be made no less than l4 days before the\nbrief is due.

No. 89. The Government did not file\nany opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After due consideration, the Court\nwill adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The Court's decision to adopt those\nredactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must:\n(l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.” Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d\nCir.l995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that\nDefendant's leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and\nuseful in the judicial process,' thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of\nthe first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d\nl4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches. Id. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the redactions are narrouly tailored to properly guard the\nprivacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the\ncorresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted.\ndocuments and corresponding exhibits.

No. l62.\nOn March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the\nGovernment had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered\nthe parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\nredactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal.

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of defense lawyers’ clients in other\nmaters and to allou defense counsel to comply with their professional obligations under\nthe rules of professional conduct.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\n<span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the\nCourt noted at the November l conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a\nspecific employer, but the type and genre of employment may be relevant to the jury's\nassessment of credibilty.

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this request\non December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of anonymity\nfor its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court\ndisagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's motion....[*** See this\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 82/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o7o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020705.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page87 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nMemorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court emphasizes that while it currently\ndenies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of course raise, and the Court will\nconsider, objections that particular lines of questioning into witnesses’ backgrounds or\nlives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968) (emphasizing that even when anonymity is not\nwarranted, the court has a duty to protect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the\nbounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any such request by\nreference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid.\nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\ncommercial flights. /d. at 3l6. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these\ntravel arrangements. /d. at 3l6-l7. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York\nand photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 32o.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with\nthe Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. /d. at 32l. In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lolo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021013.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel87 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\n\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021216.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OED 3536o38, Page44 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 42 of 348\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.!°\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nIs Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\ni As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021311.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 37 3536o38, Pagel39 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 348\n\nThe next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the\nword “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021432.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page2 of 2l7\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPAGE\nOPR Report (Nov. 2o2o) (Dkt. 2o4-3)........oooo...o..o................

Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing <span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021491.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l5 3536o39, Page6l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l5 of 348\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration.

Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\nDs Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel.

The girls—some of whom were as\nyoung as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, of-\nten under the guise of a “massage.”\n\nThe evidence at trial included, among other things,\nthe testimony of four women who described the sexual\nabuse they suffered at the hands of Maxwell and Ep-\nstein; the testimony of former employees of Epstein\nand Maxwell; the testimony of law enforcement offic-\ners; corroborating physical evidence, including photo-\ngraphs of and evidence recovered from searches of Ep-\nstein’s residences and Maxwell and Epstein’s black ad-\ndress book; and other corroborating records, such as\nflight logs of Epstein’s private planes and FedEx rec-\nords.\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, Maxwell had a\nclose and intimate relationship with Epstein.\n(Tr.l494-96; GX-422).!l Maxwell was Epstein’s girl-\nfriend for many years, until the early 2ooos, after\n\nl “Tr.” refers to the trial <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>; “GX” refers to\na Government exhibit at trial; “Voir Dire Tr.” refers to\nthe voir dire <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>; “Br.” refers to Maxwell’s brief\non appeal; “A.” refers to the appendix filed with that\nbrief; “SA” refers to the supplemental appendix filed\nwith this brief; and “Dkt.” refers to an entry on the Dis-\ntrict Court’s docket for this case.

Judge Nathan also correctly rejected Max-\nwell’s “central argument” that she should imply or in-\nfer bias “based on the purported similarities between\n[Juror 5o’s] personal history and the issues at trial.”\n(A.342-43). Judge Nathan explained that she “need not\nimagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that\nconclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every\nfollou-up question requested by the Defendant with\nregard to a juror’s personal experience with sexual as-\nsault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority\nof these eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose\nany follou-up questions.” (A.344-45). One prospective\njuror described her oun childhood sexual abuse at an\nage closer to the victims in this case; another described\na friend’s recent coercive sexual abuse by a professor.\n(A.345). Maxwell did not even bring a for-cause chal-\nlenge as to either. Ud.). Similarly, a for-cause chal-\nlenge against Juror 5o would not have prevailed.\n\nOn appeal, Maxwell contends that, had Juror 5o\nanswered the questionnaire accurately, it “clearly”\nwould have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.”\n(Br.67). In particular, Maxwell challenges Judge Na-\nthan’s finding that Juror 5o was credible and unbi-\nased, relying on a few isolated statements drawn from\nvarious parts of the hearing <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> and some of his\npost-verdict statements. (Br.7l-72). As described\nabove, Judge Nathan explained hou Juror 5o’s expla-\nnation for his erroneous answers was plausible and\nconsistent, and she found him credible after assessing\nhis demeanor through challenging questioning. She\nalso properly disregarded his post-verdict statements\nabout the case, explaining that “[a] juror’s view of a\ncase and defendant would necessarily change after\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021734.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page87 of 93\n74\n\nprostitution must be a “significant or motivating pur-\npose” of the interstate transportation). Maxwell only\ncame to the theory she nou advances after a lengthy\ndiscussion spanning ten pages of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span>.\n(A.387). And that reading is far from clear: the jury’s\nquestion does not ask whether certain facts are suffi-\ncient for guilt; it asks whether Maxwell “can be found\nguilty” if a certain fact is true. Maxwell “can” be found\nguilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in\nNew Mexico, which is probative of Maxwell’s intent\nand role in transporting Jane. That is a perfectly sen-\nsible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was re-\npeatedly raised by defense counsel to Judge Nathan at\ntrial. (See, e.g., Tr.3l49).\n\nSeting aside the jury note, Maxwell’s position re-\nquires the jury to have reached a series of odd conclu-\nsions. Jane testified at length about her travel to New\nYork and the ensuing sexual abuse there. It would\nmake litle sense for the jury to reject that testimony,\nand then conclude that Maxwell arranged the uniden-\ntified commercial return flight Maxwell nou empha-\nsizes, for which there is no documentary evidence in\nthe record, including no specific corroboration of Max-\nwell’s role in arranging that flight. (Compare Br.79-8o\n(“[T]he jury likely believed that if they found Maxwell\nhad some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken\nplace, they could convict her on the substantive trans-\nportation count ....”) with Tr.3l33 (defense argument\nthat there is “no evidence” Maxwell arranged a return\nflight from New Mexico)). Maxwell suggests that the\njury thought the flight records to be critical evidence,\nbut the flight logs also demonstrate that Jane was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021930.jpg": "i\nCase l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document6 Filed ll/l9/l9 Pagelofl\nDOCKET No. l9 Cr 83o (AT) DEFENDANT Tova Noel\nAUSA Nicolas Roos DEF.’S COUNSEL James E.

BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions. The BOP agreed with all recommendations.\nReport: Today's report and an interactive timeline of events can be found on the OIG's website at the\nfollouing link: htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/investigation-and-review-federal-bureau-prisons-custody-care-\nand-supervision-jeffrey\nVideo: To accompany today’s report, the OIG has released a 3-minute video of the Inspector General\ndiscussing the report's findings.

The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\n\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked\n\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\n\nhouse. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a\nduplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is writen into the book, the top copy is then torn\non the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers\nwere on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been\ninterviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of \"work.\" Other\nnames and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, \"I have girls for him\" or \"I\nhave 2 girls for him.\" These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the botom of the messages.\nDuring the execution of the warrant, | located 2 (PE <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> for} Epstein’s\nbedroom desk.

Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom.

[and then Epstein] turned over\nonto his back. She continued to rub his legs with oils. Epstein touched her breasts\nand began to masturbate”. (Police Report at 4o). That “episode” appears to be\nsynthesized from reports of two separate incidents. Houever, concerning neither\ndid Milf make mention of rubbing Epstein’s legs, thighs, and feet or of Epstein\nturning over onto his back. Nor did she allege that Epstein masturbated while\ntouching her breasts. Detective Recarey also claims (Police Report at 4o) that\nduring the sworn statement said “Epstein had purchased [Marcinkova] from\nher family in Yugoslavia . . . [and] bragged he brought her to the United States to\nbe his Yugoslavian sex slave”. No such statement is made by , who refers to\nMarcinkova as Epstein’s “girlfriend” and refers offhandedly to other women in the\nhome as “slaves”.\n\nNor did Detective Recarey include admission that on one occasion\nshe engaged in sexual conduct with Epstein’s girlfriend as a birthday “gift” to\nEpstein. Neither is atention paid in the Probable Cause Affidavits of the fact that\n\nWE naintained a MySpace webpage in which she admited to various criminal\nand dishonest acts, including creating false references for her work and her\nextensive drug use.' Nor does Detective Recarey include that refused to\ndiscuss the disposition of the thousands of dollars she said she was given by\nEpstein. (<span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 3l). Or that she falsely claimed not to use drugs (id.)\n\n| despite her MySpace entries that scream “I can’t wait to buy some weed! !!!!!!”.\nFinally, Recarey knew that =~ was not to be believed when she claimed she had\nbeen given a car by Epstein because when preparing the Probablt Cause Affidavits\n* A fleeting reference can be found in the Police Report (at 67), houever, her marijuana use is only\ngenerally noted and no mention is made of her other admited or proven dishonest conduct, including the\nreport of her thefts from her employer.\no7/26/l7 Page 2276 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32589 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032590.jpg": "Professional Standards Unit\n\nPalm Beach Police Department\n\nJanuary _, 2oo7\n\nPage 5\nRecarey was in possession of the two month rental agreement, contradicting . -\nstatements.

Nor is\nthe evidence that she engaged in multiple thefts from her retail employer included.\n\na Sworn Statement of Juan Alessi. The Police Report and Probable\nCause Affidavits detail information purportedly obtained by Detective Recarey\nfrom Juan Alessi, a former Epstein house manager. The statement was recorded by\na stenographer. A comparison of the <span class=\"highlight\">transcript</span> and the Police Report and Probable\nCause Affidavits reveal significant differences. Detective Recarey reports that\n“Alessi stated that touards the end of his employment, the masseuses were\nyounger and younger”. (Police Report at 57). Alessi actually stated that for the\nmost part the masseuses did not appear young. (<span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at 9). Alessi further\ndeclared that only “one” girl was young and in his judgment she looked “l6 or\nl7”. Gd.).\n\nDetective Recarey also notes (Police Report at 57) that Alessi claimed “the\nbed would almost always have to be made after the massage”. This statement is\ndirectly contradicted by other witness statements, which are devoid of any\n\n| accusation by any woman that any activity ever occurred on the bed. Indeed,\nAlessi himself actually stated that on a “few” occasions the bed was unmade after\na massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (<span class=\"highlight\">Transcript</span> at ll-l2). Alessi\nfurther explained that even in the absence of a massage he could be called upon to\nmake Epstein’s bed three or four times a day, (id), thus providing an innocent\nexplanation for the frequent bed making. It was in fact Detective Recarey who\nsuggested that “something else occurred”, and even then, Alessi insisted he did not\nknou of “something else”: “. . . or something else, I cannot [say]”. (/d.).\n\nThere is also no mention of Alessi’s burglary of the Epstein residence; his\ntheft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi’s suicidal ideations, all of\nwhich made him an unreliable witness.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 2277 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR- ooo3259o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032654.jpg": "l [Tape begins slou/warped; becomes regular speed]\nZ\n3 DETECTIVE: October ll, 2oo5 UI number UI Detective Joe Recarey [ph].\n4 Present with me is detective Dawson of the Palm Beach Police\n5 Department.

I was like that’s not a\n\n6 real job you’re like tell me the truth but anyway I took that as he,\n\n7 he told me his explanation was ‘It’s my job to knou hou people’s\n\n8 brains work’ and I said, whatever the fuck that means, whatever,\n\n9 you knou you’re just some old guy, and I went home.
