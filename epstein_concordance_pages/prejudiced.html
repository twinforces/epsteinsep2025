(Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46.

This is particularly so when weighed against the\nrisks of early production to the Government’s ongoing investigation.\n\nBy contrast, the Government has met its burden under Rule l6(d)(l) by explaining why\nthe requested delay is necessary and hou the Government would be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by the immediate\nproduction of the Materials. In particular, the proposed delay will allou the Government to\ncontinue its investigation into conduct outside the period charged in the Indictment without\nrevealing to the defendant the identities of the witnesses in that investigation. The premature\nrevelation of this information would give the defendant the opportunity to interfere with the\nGovernment’s investigation before it is complete.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 26\nclaims about Ms. Maxwell because of the passage of time.° A review of the media coverage of\nthe Epstein story reflects an unwarranted transformation of Ms. Maxwell from Epstein friend to\nEpstein conspirator.

Sprouts, 282 F.3d\nlo37, lo4l (8th Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nThe vast majority of pre-indictment delay cases fail on the first prong. See, e.g., Marion,\n4o4 U.S. at 324-25 (fading witness memories insufficient; “no one suggests that every delay-\ncaused detriment to a defendant’s case should abort a criminal prosecution”); United States v.\nSnyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v.

In\nparticular, she contends that, as a result of the passage of time, four witnesses have died, unnamed\nEpstein employees have been “lost,” unspecified witnesses nou have “failed or corrupted”\nmemories, and records have been lost or destroyed. She further contends that these collectively\ndemonstrate actual prejudice. (Def. Mot. 7 at 8-l4). None has merit, individually or collectively.\n\nWith respect to the first three arguments, the fact that certain witnesses cannot testify\nbecause of their deaths or failed memories does not compel a finding of actual prejudice. “Faded\nmemories or unavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal\na defendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.”\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003007.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 239\nomited)). The defendant has not and cannot establish that Epstein would have been available to\ntestify in the first instance, much less that he would have voluntarily agreed to testify at her trial\nin a way that would help, rather than hurt, the defendant.\n\nAs to Epstein’s mother, who died in April 2oo4, the defendant contends that she “would\nhave testified that she did not observe Ms. Maxwell with any Accusers between l994 and l997.”\n(Def. Mot. 7 at 9). “Counsel’s unsworn assertions as to vague generalities” that witnesses, “if\nalive, would give testimony helpful to [the defendant] do not shou that [the defendant’s] ability to\npresent a defense has been substantially and actually <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” United States v. Scala, 388 F.\nSupp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). Here, “there is no evidence before the Court as to what\n[the deceased witness] would have testified, much less specific evidence of hou losing that\ntestimony has caused [the defendant] actual prejudice.” Jd. at 4oo. Further, unless Epstein’s\nmother was with the defendant “every moment” between l994 and l997, “it would be impossible\nfor [her] to testify that [the] defendant did not commit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful\ntestimony [she] might have offered (the details of which are sparse in the motion) would be easily\nundermined on cross-examination.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (citing Spears, l59\nF.3d at lo8l-lo85). Moreover, Epstein’s mother died “sufficiently prior to ‘any realistic trial\ndate,’ to make it improbable that any prejudice it may have caused [the defendant] was the result\nof government delay.” United States v. Cheung Kin Ping, 555 F.2d lo69, lo73 (2d Cir. l977)\n(quoting United States v. Stein, 456 F.2d 844, 848 (2d Cir. l972)). Indeed, Epstein’s mother passed\naway before the Palm Beach Police Department even began investigating Epstein in 2oo5. (Def.\nMot. 7, Ex. D at i).\n\nThe defendant’s claims relating to Michael Casey and Detective Recarey fare no beter.\nShe again speculates that Casey and Detective Recarey, who passed away in August 2ol7 and May\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 239\nto the instant prosecution, is insufficient to shou actual prejudice. .. . The fact that evidence may\nbe lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment stage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the\nduration. Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the destruction of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate pre-trial\npublicity from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation. The defendant\ncites not one case in support of her argument that pre-trial publicity can ever establish actual\nprejudice, nor does she point to any evidence that the Government fomented such publicity dating\nback to 2oll. To the extent the defendant is concerned about pretrial publicity, she will have the\nopportunity to propose an appropriate examination of potential jurors during voir dire to identify\na panel of impartial jurors who have not been <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any publicity this case may have\ngarnered.\n\nIn short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,\nspeculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay.'!? The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide discovery adequate\nto fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in discovery are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment. (/d.). As described herein,\nsee Section X, infra, the Government has made substantial discovery productions pursuant to Rule\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]he Supreme Court has recognized three purposes for the supervisory pouers, ‘to\nimplement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring\nthat a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy\n\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003691.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 34\nl7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7,\n322 (l97l)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of\nlimitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a\ndefendant must shou both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an\nimproper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the\ncharges. See id. This is a stringent standard. “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have\nshut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses\nprosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.”” DeMichele v.\nGreenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, l67 F.3d 784, 79o-9l (2d Cir. l999).\n\nThe Court sees no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was\ndesigned to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is enough to say that\nMaxwell does not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.\nMaxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> her interests\nbecause potential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or\ndestroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference\nin her case.\n\nMaxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include\nJeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged\nvictims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends\nthey all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have\ngenerally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable\ntestimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388\nF. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach.

Indeed,\nmany of the arguments made by the government in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions reveal\nnew information that undercut its claims about the origins of, and motives behind, this\nprosecution.\n\nMs. Maxwell raised this issue pretrial, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P l2(b)(3)(A)(i). In\nher opening memorandum Ms. Maxwell noted that significant discovery related to the\nallegations had not yet been provided by the government, that her investigation is ongoing, and\nrequested that the Court defer ruling on this motion.\n\nThe government’s responses to Ms. Maxwell’s motions, including its response to this\nmotion, underscore the legitimacy of Ms. Maxwell’s continued request that the Court hold this\nissue open. As reflected in the various pleadings, the government did have communications with\nlawyers for civil litigants and did have information about the allegations made in the indictment\nwell before it claims the investigation was opened. Ms. Maxwell learned about these things only\nbecause the government felt the need to make partial disclosures in an atempt to defend its\nactions.\n\nIn its response to the instant motion, the government, without actually disclosing the\nwitness’s statements, selectively “proffers” “facts” to justify its position but tells Ms. Maxwell\nand the Court that we should, apparently, just trust the government because “the underlying\ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 3o2 reports of interviews with the victims, will be\nproduced to the defense as 35oo material in advance of trial.” Resp. at 55 fn. 2l.\n\nAs discussed in her Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Specificity, for a Bill of Particulars,\nand for Pretrial Disclosures, the government’s failure to provide adequate information about the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl3\nThe Hon.

Ms. Maxwell must nou: search various records (to the extent they\nare available) and track doun numerous witnesses to determine her locations and activities\nduring this expanded period. She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations. These\nare time consuming and difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial of a\ncontinuance under these circumstances would constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy.

Because this Motion does not challenge the relevance of the\ngovernment’s allegations regarding Accuser-l and Accuser-2, the inflammatory and prejudicial\nnature of those allegations alone would not provide a basis to strike them. See United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (noting that if evidence of allegation is relevant,\nallegation may not be stricken regardless of hou prejudicial it is). Houever, the government’s\nsuggestion that Ms. Maxwell is not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by the inclusion of false, irrelevant allegations\nthat Ms. Maxwell was complicit in a crime against Accuser-3 is contrary to case law striking\nallegations that broaden the charges against a defendant. See, e.g., United States v. Greebel, No.\nl5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (“An unsupported . . .\nallegation that Mr. Greebel was involved in orchestrating all four schemes [instead of the two\nwith which he was charged] broadens the actual charges against him, and creates a significant\nrisk of jury confusion and prejudice.”); United States v.

Supp. l538, l547\n(S.D.N.Y. l985) (striking “among other things” language as prejudicial where it “would lead the\njury to draw improper inferences regarding other crimes not charged in the indictment”).\n\nThe government’s allegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual abuse” of\nAccuser-3 is both untrue and highly prejudicial. The government is simply trying to bolster a\nweak case by including irrelevant, prejudicial allegations from a third accuser that have no\nbearing on the charged crimes.

No. 2o4\nat 23-36), and for the reasons set forth in the Court’s April Opinion (Apr. Op. at 9-l6), the\nprosecution of Counts Five and Six is timely.\nIV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the S2 Indictment Based on Alleged Improper\n\nPre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should dismiss the S2 Indictment because the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing the charges violates her due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 22). In\nmaking this motion, the defendant asks the Court to provide such relief for the “same reasons\ndiscussed in her prior motion” (Def. Mot. at 22)—reasons this Court already considered and\nrejected. This Court evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and concluded\nthat the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a claim that any\nalleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Apr. Op. at l7). “To prevail on a\nclaim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a defendant must shou both that the\nGovernment intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the delay\nseriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the charges.” (Apr. Op. at l7 (citing\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999))).°\n\nAs to the element of actual and substantial prejudice, the Court found that the defendant\ndid “not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support” her claim. (Apr. Op. at l7).\nThe Court concluded that the defendant “failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges,” rejecting the defendant’s “highly speculative”\narguments that the death of certain potential witnesses, failing memories, or lost records <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>\n® Moreover, “[w]here an indictment is brought within the statute of limitations, there is a\npresumption that the [defendant] was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” Van Stuyvesant v.

(/d. at l7). In her current\nmotion, the defendant offers no additional factual claims in support of her argument that the\npassage of time has <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> her defense. She instead refers the Court back to her prior\nhypothetical, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand scrutiny. The\ndefendant has not remotely carried her “heavy burden” of proof. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. Her\nrenewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment\ndelay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See United States v. Pierre-\nLouis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). In any event, in\ndenying the defendant’s pre-trial motions filed in January, the Court noted the absence of\n“evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Apr. Op. at l7). That remains true.\n\nThe defendant argues that the “S2 Indictment only compounds [the excessive pre-\nindictment delay] issues by charging additional offenses based on alleged conduct that the\ngovernment has knoun about since in or about 2oo7, which it added for tactical reasons to shore\nup its case against Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment acted in bad faith—to the extent she is making such an argument—is based on no\nevidence whatsoever, and for good reason: it is not true.\n\nAs the Government has previously explained (see Dkt. No. l99), the Government obtained\nthe S2 Indictment—which added counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor\nvictim, Minor Victim-4—based on new evidence that was not available to the Government at the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6l of 8o\n\nAn entirely different situation arises when the decision not to prosecute is\nunconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it\ninduces the defendant to act in reliance thereupon.

In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues\nthat count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either\ncounts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the\nCourt’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper\npretrial delay.

Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *9. Maxwell’s\nmotion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the\nrecord indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does\nnot make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell\ncontends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> her interests because\npotential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It\nis highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion &\nOrder, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in\nbringing charges.

THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R.

(quoting ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 36o F.3d 9o, 98-99 (2d Cir.\n2oo4)). “The Second Circuit has explained that the party seeking to restrict press access bears a\n‘heavy’ burden.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 36o F.3d at lo6).\n\nHere, the defense manifestly fails to carry its “heavy burden.” /d. The defendant’s request\nto seal provides the Court with no basis on which to make the specific factual findings required to\nconceal voir dire, including the parties’ joint juror questionnaire, from the public. Stewart, 36o\nF.3d at 98. In an effort to justify the defendant’s request, the Leter speculates that “media\ncoverage may prejudice the jury selection process.” Leter l.

The questionnaire and voir dire are\n\n5 designed to unearth that kind of prior exposure and any\n\n6 resulting potential bias.\n\n7 Nor is it clear what prejudice results from that\n\n8 possibility. As I said, I am not persuaded that in the off\n\n9 chance there's a juror who has the questionnaire or a media\n\nlo reporter has the questionnaire in advance and fails to disclose\nll that, it's somehou <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> in their response to a question.\nl2 If a juror's going to lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that\nl3 out, and the fact of this questionnaire being publicly docketed\nl4 is not going to increase or decrease any such likelihood.\n\nl5 Moreover, as I said, the proposed exact questionnaires\nl6 are in my experience regularly docketed, including in\n\nl7 comparably high-profile cases. Again, in Judge Donnelly's case\nl8 just very recently, so similar nature of charges, similar\n\nl9 high-publicity media atention, in an age of social media and\n2o the like, she docketed the proposed her addressed questionnaire\n2l in advance of jury selection, as I understand it.

Rule 4o3\n\nThe significant probative value of this evidence is not substantially outweighed by any\nunfair prejudice. First and foremost, as all agree, in addition to a similar acts instruction, the\nparties’ joint request to charge proposes that the jury be instructed that it cannot convict the\ndefendant solely on the basis of evidence relating to Minor Victim-3, and that an element of the\nMann Act offenses is that the victim must be younger than seventeen. That is, the jury will be told\nin three different ways during the jury instructions that evidence relating to Minor Victim-3, on its\noun, cannot satisfy the elements of the offense. There is accordingly no risk that the jury will be\nconfused and convict because they think the defendant’s conduct with Minor Victim-3, in\nisolation, violated some law.\n\nIn any event, the touchstone of Rule 4o3 prejudice analysis in this context is whether the\nevidence admited under Rule 4o4(b) is “more sensational or disturbing” than the charged crimes.\nUnited States v. Rosemond, 958 F.3d ll, l25 (2d Cir. 2o2o). That is not the case here. Minor\nVictim-3’s account of sexual exploitation fits neatly into the patern that the other Minor Victims\nwill describe. It is not more sensational or disturbing—and even the defendant has not suggested\notherwise. (See Def. Mot. 4 at l2-l3, Dkt. No. 387; Def. Reply at 29-3o, Dkt. No. 398; ll/ol/2l\nTr. at 82:22-83:5).\n\nInstead, the defense argues that it will be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> if Minor Victim-3 states that she was\n“sexually abused” by Epstein. (Def. Mot. 4 at l3, Dkt. No. 387; see ll/ol/2l Tr. at 82:22-83:5).\nAccording to the defense, this will suggest to the jury that the defendant engaged in illegal conduct\n> The cases the defendant relies on to shou that Minor Victim-3 is not direct evidence of the\noffense generally admited that evidence under Rule 4o4(b).

D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\ninstruction defining the scope of a conspiracy or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan instruction defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially <span class=\"highlight\">Prejudiced</span> Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8945", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 22 of 37\nMexico, she had denied being sexually abused there. It was not until just before trial, after the\ngovernment had questioned her about the New Mexico trip in her preparation for trial, that Jane\nclaimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at\nthe ranch. See supra note l.\n\nJane’s new recollection about the New Mexico trip was disclosed at the eleventh hour\nand substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her defense. See id. (“The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.”). Because the Mann Act counts as charged in the Indictment were\nbased on a violation of New York law, the defense vigorously litigated the extent to which the\ngovernment could introduce evidence of sexual activity that occurred in jurisdictions outside of\nNew York in support of the Mann Act counts. As part of that effort, the defense requested\nlimiting instructions with respect to the testimony of Kate and Annie Farmer. The limiting\ninstructions, which were read to the jury immediately before the witnesses began their testimony,\nspecifically instructed the jury that any sexual conduct that Kate or Annie Farmer said occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein “was not ‘illegal sexual activity’ as the government has charged in the\nindictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2; Tr. 2o48:22-2o49:l.\n\nHad the defense been given sufficient notice that Jane would testify that she was sexually\nabused in New Mexico, we would have litigated this issue before trial and, at the very least,\nmade an application to the Court to give a limiting instruction before the start of Jane’s testimony\nsimilar to the one given for Annie Farmer, who also testified about a single instance of sexual\ncontact at the ranch in New Mexico when she was l6 years old, which could not have violated\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3o of 37\ntrafficking conspiracy was to “recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain” a minor to\nengage in a commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn and others to\ngive sexualized massages to Epstein in exchange for cash, there would be no sex trafficking\ncount.\n\nFor these reasons, Counts One, Three, and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on\nonly one of these counts.\n\nIi. The Court Should Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Conviction and Dismiss the S2 Indictment\n\nDue to Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the\nIndictment due to the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution\nagainst Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due process rights. Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293). The Court denied the\nmotion each time on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell failed to shou “actual and substantial\nprejudice” caused by the delay. (Dkt. 2o7 at l6-l8; Dkt. 3l7 at lo). The Court, houever,\ngranted Ms. Maxwell leave to renew the motion after the conclusion of trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8;\nDkt. 3l7 at lo). Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts the same motion and incorporates the arguments\npreviously made to the Court.\n\nIn addition, the record at trial highlighted numerous other examples of hou the delay in\ncharging this case substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> Ms. Maxwell’s defense. For example, critical\ndocumentary records and witnesses that would have alloued Ms. Maxwell to effectively\nchallenge the government’s proof were no longer available, including the follouing:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8954", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page4ofl3\nl. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\nintervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 37 of 66\n\nChallenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable bias, or actual basis.\nSee Torres, l28 F.3d at 43; see also Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l62—67 (discussing at\nlength each type of bias).\n\nl. Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a prospective\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a prospective juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting Sampson, 82o F.\nSupp. 2d at l63-64); see also Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d\nll5o, ll59 (loth Cir. l99l) (holding, in murder case in which the defendant presented a\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o38", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\n<span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His Questionnaire Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to intervene and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto intervene, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009238.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBmctien en O34 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 36 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, vy\n\nPAUL M.

Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2—l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nII. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of5l\nfrom those alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l. Reversal due to a\nvariance is appropriate only when the defendant can establish “that substantial prejudice occurred\nat trial as a result of the variance,” a shouing that cannot be made “where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character that could have misled the\ndefendant at trial, and where the variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294. “The\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly held that, so long as a defendant receives notice of the Government’s\ntheory of the case before trial, he is not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by a variance.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\nra,\nB. Discussion\n\nNo constructive amendment or variance occurred in this case. The grand jury returned the\nS2 Indictment charging the defendant with knouingly transporting Jane with the intent that Jane\nengage in criminal sexual activity in New York, and aiding and abeting the same, and with\nconspiring to entice and transport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York. That is the core of criminality charged in the S2\nIndictment, and it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury\ninstructions.\n\nl. The Proof at Trial and Jury Instructions Captured the Core of Criminality\n\nThe defendant argues that the core of criminality for the Mann Act counts “was a scheme\nby Epstein and [the defendant] to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the\nintent that they would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.” (Def. Mot. at 9).\nThat is precisely the theory the Government advanced at trial. As the defendant correctly states,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9569", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 23 oof5l\n\n3. No Variance Occurred\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred at trial. The evidence at trial did not prove any\nfacts materially different from those alleged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. See\nGross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (explaining that a variance occurs when “the evidence offered\nat trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment”). The S2 Indictment\nalleged that the defendant was Epstein’s close associate and co-conspirator who groomed minor\nvictims, including Jane between in or about l994 and in or about l997, and that the defendant and\nEpstein groomed minor victims for abuse in various places, including Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico. (See S2 Indictment 4] 5, 9, l3). That is exactly what the Government proved at trial. It\nwas no variance that the S2 Indictment did not specifically allege that Jane was abused in New\nMexico—especially where, as here, that fact was offered as evidence of the conduct charged in the\nS2 Indictment, but was not by itself sufficient to convict the defendant. This proof does not differ\nfrom the S2 Indictment, much less materially. Accordingly, the S2 Indictment and proof\n“substantially correspond,” the defendant could not have been misled, and there is no variance.\nKhalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294.\n\nThe defendant argues that she was <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> because Jane recalled that she was abused\nduring her New Mexico trip shortly before trial, which prevented the defendant from filing a\nmotion to preclude the testimony or giving a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony. (Def.\nMot. at l6-l8). This argument is belied by the record. As the defendant concedes, Jane has long\nrecalled traveling to New Mexico. (/d. at l6-l7). The defendant therefore had “fair and adequate\nnotice” that the Mann Act conspiracies included conduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9585", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 24 of5l\n\nis all that is required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 622 (2d Cir. 2oo3). And in any\nevent, Jane recalled the incident of abuse at least as early as November 3, 2o2l. (See Def. Mot. at\n5 n.l (citing 35o9-o33 at l)). Notes from that interview were provided to the defense on November\n6, 2o2l—more than three weeks before trial. At the time, the parties were still litigating whether\nKate could testify at all. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 4l7 (order dated November 6, 2o2l, requiring the\nGovernment to brief whether Kate was a “victim” for any legal purpose, including restitution)).\nThe Court did not permit Kate to testify until November l9, 2o2l—almost two weeks after the\ndefendant received the relevant notes. (Dkt. No. 477). And follouing that decision, the parties\ncontinued to litigate the limiting instructions for Kate and Annie in advance of trial. (See, e.g.,\nll/23/2l Tr. at 28-38).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant had ample notice to seek a limiting instruction as to this portion\nof Jane’s testimony. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“rejecting a prejudice argument in part because\n“t]he government disclosed the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). The Court’s\nfailure to give one sua sponte is not a prejudicial variance. The defendant is simply characterizing\nher failure to ask for a limiting instruction at the time of Jane’s testimony as an argument that she\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>. To the contrary, the Court did not err—much less plainly so. See United States\nv. Petit, l9 Cr. 85o (JSR), 2o2l WL 67346l, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2l, 2o2l) (applying the plain\nerror standard to a constructive amendment claim in a Rule 33 motion that was not made at trial).\n\nFinally, even if the defendant had been entitled to a limiting instruction but was deprived\nof the opportunity to request it, she still was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>. As the Court agreed at the charge\nconference, although the Court gave the limiting instructions for Annie and Kate, there was no\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9586", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 39of5l\nStates v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988). The defendant has not made such a\nshouing. Her abstract assertions simply do not rise to that level, and the law is clear that “proof\nof prejudice must be definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at lo5-o6; see also Long, 697\nF. Supp. at 657 (finding that “perceived prejudice is speculative” where there was “no way of\nknouing what [the unavailable witness’s] testimony would have been”); United States v. Valona,\n834 F.2d l334, l339 (7th Cir. l987) (noting that prejudice analysis must consider whether the\nmissing witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” whether the jury would have found\nhim a “credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when compared to other trial evidence\n“would affect the trial outcome”); Spears, l59 F.3d at lo85. “Courts have generally found that\nvague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do not justify\ndismissing an indictment for delay.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7); see also United States v. Scala, 388 F.\nSupp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5) (“Counsel’s unsworn assertions as to vague generalities”\nthat witnesses, “if alive, would give testimony helpful to [the defendant] do not shou that [the\ndefendant’s] ability to present a defense has been substantially and actually <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.”). Here,\n“there is no evidence before the Court as to what [the deceased witnesses] would have testified,\nmuch less specific evidence of hou losing that testimony has caused [the defendant] actual\nprejudice.” /d. at 4oo. The defense’s unsworn assertions about what “the defense believes” these\nwitnesses “could have established” or “could have testified” to do not justify dismissing the\nIndictment or vacating the defendant’s conviction. (Def. Mot. at 29-3o).\n\nSecond, even assuming that Pinto, Salhi, Markham, and Fontanilla would have testified as\nthe defendant contends, such testimony would have no bearing on whether the defendant did, in\n38\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 37 of 66\n\nChallenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable bias, or actual basis.\nSee Torres, l28 F.3d at 43; see also Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l62—67 (discussing at\nlength each type of bias).\n\nl. Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a prospective\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a prospective juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting Sampson, 82o F.\nSupp. 2d at l63-64); see also Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v.

These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His Questionnaire Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to intervene and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4).

The ensuing determination of whether the juror was biased or\n<span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> against the defendant may be “affected both by whether the nondisclosure was\ndeliberate and, if it was, by the juror’s motivation to conceal the truth.” United States v. McCoy,\n995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72-73. It is important to consider\nwhether a juror’s answer was dishonest in the second part of the test “because it can shou ‘a\npersonal interest in this particular case that was so pouerful as to cause the juror to commit a\nserious crime [by lying during voir dire].’” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 438\n(W.D.N.Y. 2ol7), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (alteration\nin original) (quoting United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l5l (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify\n\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the\n\neffect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\n\nconceming the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or\n\nevidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). As explained in this Court’s prior opinion, the rule is subject to certain\nexceptions inapplicable here. See Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at l2. The rule, which embodies\n“‘long-accepted Federal law,” is an important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system.\nTanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987) (rejecting a constitutional challenge to the\nrule). It enables “full and frank discussion in the jury room” and secures “jurors’ willingness to\nreturn an unpopular verdict.” Jd. Without the rule, the finality of verdicts, upon which the\nsystem relies, would be seriously disrupted. See id. at l2o-2l, l24-25; see also Warger v.\nShauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 45, 49-5o (2ol4).

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page2 of 45\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo368", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.

(quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22).

Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 35 of 45\nunderstanding. See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes of this motion, the\nCourt will assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico constituted a variance from the\n° As noted above, because the Court will not enter judgment on Count One on the parties’ consent, the Court\naddresses only Count Three here. In any event, the Defendant’s arguments as to why Counts One and Three were\nconstructively amended are the same.

The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\n<span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 37 of 45\nrequest a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that\nshe was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)). The Defendant “must shou both\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial prejudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points’’).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)). The Defendant provides no basis to conclude that the jury\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 45 of 45\ncaptured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>\nby any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant’s\nmotion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with\nCount Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three.\nCount Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant’s participation in the same\ndecade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein,\nto groom and sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six.\nThe Defendant’s sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22.

P. l6(b)(l)(A).\nAlthough “[a] defendant would always like more information about the government’s case before\nrevealing anything about his or her oun,” Rule l6 “conditions a defendant’s disclosure obligations\non the government’s having made certain specified disclosures, not on the government’s laying\nopen its entire case or the defendant’s satisfaction.” United States v.

(“The majority of the Advisory Commitee is of the view that\n... the giving a broader right of discovery to the defense is dependent upon giving also a broader\nright of discovery to the prosecution.”). When the defendant “avail[s herself] of the strategy to\nobtain discovery of the government, [s]he must comply with the requirement for reciprocal\ndiscovery”—even as to exhibits the defendant might introduce only if the defendant herself\ntestifies. United States v. Ryan, 448 F. Supp. 8lo, 8lo-ll (S.D.N.Y. l978).

The government contends\nthat it was <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by its oun failure to investigate whether its witness was telling the truth.”\nGov. Leter at 6. Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories\nabout where Ms. Maxwell lived in l994—at a home in the Kensington neighborhood, or at the\nKinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood. The government chose not to investigate\nwhere Ms. Maxwell actually lived in l994 and which, if any, of Kate’s stories were true. That is\nnot Ms. Maxwell’s fault. And neither is it her duty to do the government’s work for it. The\ngovernment cannot seriously contend that an investigation into where Ms. Maxwell lived “did\nnot become necessary” until after Kate testified. Gov. Leter at 6.\n\nThe government complains about the difficulty of conducting investigations abroad. Gov.\nLeter at 6 (“That is a time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving\nmultiple agencies in each country that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the\nconclusion of trial.”). The government’s complaints are overwrought. For one thing, the\ngovernment had investigators in the United Kingdom investigating Ms. Maxwell’s college\nrecord. There was nothing preventing these investigators from asking the most basic of\nquestions: When did Ms. Maxwell purchase the Kinnerton Street property?\n\n? The government’s failure to investigate is not limited to Kate’s allegations. The veracity\nof another accuser, Jane, is the subject of a post-testimony 35oo disclosure. ay\nee\na —CSsSCSCsCises\na\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll337", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government could\nhave asked those same investigators to obtain property records. Further, the government has the\nability to avail itself of a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), an agreement between the\nUnited States and United Kingdom and an investigatory tool frequently used by the government\nfor the purpose of gathering and exchanging information with the United Kingdom in the course\nof criminal investigations.\n\nNou that the date of Ms. Maxwell’s purchase of Kinnerton Street is relevant, Ms.\nMaxwell has requested these registry entries from Her Majesty’s Land Registry. These entries\nshou the transfer of title of 44 Kinnerton Street to Ghislaine Maxwell in March l997 after the\nl996 Agreement for Sale. Ms. Maxwell will provide these documents to the government as soon\nas she has them.\n\nIn addition, just this morning, Ms. Maxwell obtained a copy of the Transfer of Title for\nKinnerton Street to Ms. Maxwell. Ms. Maxwell provided this document to the government\nwithin three hours of first receiving it. Thus, once it became clear that the l996 Agreement was\nrelevant, it took just days for Ms. Maxwell to obtain independently relevant and admissible\nevidence proving the same point—that Kate testified to an impossibility. Because the\ngovernment has received a copy of the Transfer of Title, and because Ms. Maxwell will\nimmediately produce the public records she obtains from the Land Registry, the government\ncannot claim to be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by the discovery of the l996 Agreement.\n\n3 htps://eservices.landregistry.gov.uk/eservices/FindA Property/view/QuickEnquirylnit.do\n(last visited Dec. l3, 2o2l).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooll338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014872.jpg": "CaseQa2o-22oo83o-PAEIm db dahentl73o2l2 o Ail ab 3 27ee/ 2A ag Payef2H of 26\na violation of New York law.”* It is therefore not “uncertain whether\n[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand\njury’s indictment.”\n\nWe also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially\nvaried from the Indictment.

The Public Interest\n\nPlaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allouing her claims to proceed.\n(8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 5.) Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil\nlitigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a\nwrongdoer. (/d.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently\nbeing litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation\nof this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant\nMaxwell’s well knoun criminal enterprise, hou it was operated and all those involved.” (/d.) It\nis a mischaracterization of this action, houever, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for\naddressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell\nhas been stayed, it has not been terminated — just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.\nMoreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity\nof criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr.) Should civil discovery proceed, there\nis a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature disclosure of the\ntestimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson,\n2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of\ngranting a stay.\n\nAccordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell\nhas met her burden to shou that a stay of this action is warranted.\n\nC. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.\n\nThe Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant\nMaxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety. Indeed, the\nCo-Executors take pains to argue that a partial stay as to only Plaintiff's claims against Maxwell\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9455", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019602.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Pagell of l5\nDistrict Court in the criminal case.” Doc. 37, p l7 (emphasis in original).

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020294.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page4 of 3o\n\nThe Government makes much of the fact that its Indictment is\n“speaking.” But speaking or not, an indictment is not a substitute for\nevidence and cannot be used as proof that the case is strong.

To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a\ndefendant must shou both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an\nimproper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the\ncharges. See id. This is a stringent standard. “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have\nshut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses\nprosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.” DeMichele v.\nGreenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, l67 F.3d 784, 79o-9l (2d Cir. l999).\n\nThe Court sees no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was\ndesigned to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Houever, it is enough to say that\nMaxwell does not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.\nMaxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> her interests\nbecause potential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or\ndestroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference\nin her case.\n\nMaxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include\nJeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged\nvictims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends\nthey all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have\ngenerally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable\ntestimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d.

Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies.

See United States v.

See D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6. Accordingly, the Court concludes that no\nconstructive amendment resulted as to Count Four.\n\n3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.\n\nThe Defendant’s argument as to constructive amendment of Count Three, conspiracy to\ntransport, wholly depends on her theory as to Count Four.’ She argues that since it is “clear” that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four based only on Jane’s New Mexico testimony, it\nmust have convicted on the same basis for the conspiracy counts. Maxwell Br. at l6. Because\nno constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, this argument is unavailing. But even if\nthe Court were persuaded that the jury note revealed that the jury convicted the Defendant of\nCount Four on that basis, the note pertained only to Count Four and provided no basis to\nspeculate as to the jury’s conviction of Count Three. Moreover, it is not substantially likely that\nthe jury convicted the Defendant of Count Three on Jane’s New Mexico testimony alone. As\ndescribed in detail above in the Court’s denial of the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the\nGovernment presented evidence that Annie and Carolyn were also victims of the conspiracy.\nAccordingly, even if a constructive amendment resulted as to Count Four, vacatur would still not\nbe warranted as to Count Three.\n\nC. No prejudicial variance occurred.\n\nIn the alternative, the Defendant argues that she was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> because the\nIndictment did not contain any allegations that Jane was sexually abused in New Mexico. She\ntherefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction.

The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\n<span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span>. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021020.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel94 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 37 of 45\nrequest a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that\nshe was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)). The Defendant “must shou both\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021026.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2oo of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial preyudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points”).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s anticipated testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)).

Indeed, although Jane had previously told\nthe FBI about the trip to New Mexico, she had denied being sexually abused\nthere. It was not until just before trial, that Jane claimed for the first time that\nshe had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at the ranch.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s convictions on Counts Three and\nFour were based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The\nCourt must vacate these convictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021529.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 353 3536o39, Page99 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 5 of 2l\n\nThe Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for\na hearing. Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2-l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nIf. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l529", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021816.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-l, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Page22 of 26\na violation of New York law.”* It is therefore not “uncertain whether\n[Maxwell] was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand\njury’s indictment.” #\n\nWe also cannot conclude that the evidence at trial prejudicially\nvaried from the Indictment. To allege a variance, a defendant “must\nestablish that the evidence offered at trial differs materially from the\nevidence alleged in the indictment.” To prevail and win reversal, the\ndefendant must further shou “that substantial prejudice occurred at\ntrial as a result” of the variance.“ “A defendant cannot demonstrate\nthat he has been <span class=\"highlight\">prejudiced</span> by a variance where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character\nthat could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the\nvariance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” ”\n\nFor reasons similar to the ones noted above in the context of the\nconstructive amendment, the evidence at trial did not prove facts\n4 A-387; see United States v.
