Regardless of Whether Sarah and Elizabeth are CVRA “Victims,” the Court Undoubtedly\n\nPossesses Discretion to Hear from them at Sentencing Under l8 U.S.C. § 366l\n\nFor all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to speak at Maxwell's\nsentencing under the CVRA.

Some of these other victims may not be able to\nafford legal counsel to present their arguments to this Court.'

The Second Circuit has not resolved this debate. See United States v. Barnes,\n56o Fed.

See Nachamie, 9l F.\nSupp. 2d at 562-63 (“A real question remains as to whether it makes sense to require a\ndefendant’s use of Rule l7(c) to obtain material from a non-party to meet [the Nixon] standard.\nUnlike the Government, the defendant has not had an earlier opportunity to obtain material by\nmeans of a grand jury subpoena. Because the Rule states only that a court may quash a subpoena\n‘if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive,’ the judicial gloss that the material sought\nmust be evidentiary—defined as relevant, admissible and specific—may be inappropriate in the\ncontext of a defense subpoena of documents from third parties.” (citing Tomison, 969 F.
