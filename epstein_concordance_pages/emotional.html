Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o).

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo342l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 275 of 348\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4526", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 246 of 349\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4543", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 276 of 349\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI.

The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\n<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\n<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves to exclude any testimony or reference to an alleged “rape” by\nJeffrey Epstein.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAccuser-l’s allegations against Mr. Epstein have been inconsistent. Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2. Evidence is relevant if it tends to\nmake a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nHere, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) is irrelevant\nto the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\ntransportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any\nother allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a rape allegation had some relevance, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Evidence is\nunfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> one.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl8o (l997).\n\nHere, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will suggest to the\njury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the\noffenses with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses a serious risk that\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\nthe “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” See id. at l8l (quoting United\nStates v.

Roldan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (affirming admission of evidence that “did not involve conduct any more sensational or\ndisturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was charged”).\n\nThe allegation that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will also\nconfuse the issues at trial and mislead the jury. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped Accuser-l. And Ms. Maxwell is not accused of conspiring to entice or transport minors\nacross state lines so Mr. Epstein could allegedly rape them. Again, the alleged conspiracy in this\ncase is limited to securing ““sexualized massages” for Mr. Epstein. If jurors hear an allegation\nabout an alleged rape by Mr. Epstein, that evidence will confuse and mislead them, in addition to\nsuggesting that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> basis. See United\nStates v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act evidence in a\nconspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would confuse the issues,\ncause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5762", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v. United States, at l8o. Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o3 provides that “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value\nis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, ... or by considerations of ...\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.” The Advisory Commitee Notes to Rule 4o3\ndefine “undue prejudice” as an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> one.” See United States v. Salim, l89 F. Supp.\n2d 93, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nHere, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice\nto Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues.

To the extent the Government claims the items are relevant\nto establish that Epstein used sex toys, any probative value of this “fact” is outweighed by\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe 2ol9 photograph of Ms. Maxwell have no role in any allegation here. To the extent\nthat the Government claims that they intend to establish an intimate relationship between Ms.\nMaxwell and Mr. Epstein, that fact is provable by other photographs and testimony.\n\nThe Manual contains multiple hearsay statements and reflects a lifestyle that many jurors\nmay find offensive. Given the lack of foundation related to the anonymous, unsigned and\nunauthenticated document any marginal relevance is outweighed by issues of confusion,\nspeculation and prejudice.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo578o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 84\nthat bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been\nabused. !\n\nThese opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience\ntreating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6) (expert testimony about “common knouledge\namong urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a\nmember of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience\nperforming several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knouledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).\n\nThese opinions also stem from the relevant literature. This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and inflammatory.” (Def.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 96l\nTABLE 2 Proposed Subtypes of Grooming\nAuthor Types of Grooming\nLeberg (l997) l.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\n<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N.

She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\n<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> congruence (a fit between the offender’s <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 299\n\nStop it Nou (2oo3).

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\nconfidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more difficult for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo5\nIn this situation, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but\nwhether consent for this sexual content occurred.\n\nThe final level of complexity regarding this pathway occurs in the\natempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after\nthe fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.\nBy its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” mater in which it is\nvery difficult to resolve conflicting claims. Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll9\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page6eof8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 96l\nTABLE 2 Proposed Subtypes of Grooming\nAuthor Types of Grooming\nLeberg (l997) l.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne difference has been found between genders of the victim in this\n<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo682o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\n<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> congruence (a fit between the offender’s <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 299\n\nStop it Nou (2oo3).

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress.

Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many\ncete respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked.

Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

The Court recognized that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal relevance (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\ntraumatic.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol. The government has also\ncautioned that Accuser-3 will likely become <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and upset if she alloued to describe these\nevents to the jury. The defense does not doubt that this is true. That is precisely why the Court\nmust exclude Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o3.

See ll/l/2o2l Tr. at\n89:2l-9o:o2 (“You see the potential, given the legality of the conduct with respect to this\nindividual, that the sort of feelings as to the immorality or wrongness or damage done to this\nindividual, all of which may be true, would have the potential to prejudice the jury by convicting\non a basis for which conviction the government has conceded would be inappropriate, would be\nunlawful.”). Moreover, a limiting instruction would be insufficient to overcome the jury’s likely\nstrong <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> response to Accuser-3’s testimony, leaving a substantial risk that the jury would\nmisapply this evidence and convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper basis. See Curley, 639 F.3d at\n6o (quoting United States v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions\ncannot be regarded as a guaranty against prejudice”)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude\nAccuser-3’s evidence for any purpose.\niI. Should the Court Admit Accuser-3’s Evidence, It Must Give the Jury An\nAppropriate Limiting Instruction\nShould the Court determine that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible under Rule 4o4(b), it\nmust give the jury the follouing limiting instruction, as set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s initial motion\nin limine:\nYou have heard testimony from this witness about sexual activity\nbetween her and Jeffrey Epstein that occurred in the United\nKingdom when she was above the age of l6, in Florida when she\nwas above the age of l8, and in the U.S. Virgin Islands when she\nwas above the age of l8.\nFor the purposes of your deliberations, I instruct you that at all\ntimes relevant to this case the legal age of consent for sexual\nactivity in the United Kingdom was l6 years old, the legal age of\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel8 of 28\npatients were telling the truth without evaluating, for example, “the changes in the core details of\nthe allegations” of her patients, which is something “professionals” in the field do.

Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

You also mentioned interpersonal violence. What is\n\n5 interpersonal violence?\n\n6 A. Violence that one person does to another person. It's a\n\n7 term in the field that refers to things such as rape and sexual\n8 assault, intimate-partner violence, sexual harassment, child\n\n9 sexual abuse. And although it's an umbrella term, using the\n\nlo term \"interpersonal violence,\" it also refers to dynamics\n\nll related to coercion and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> abuse or child abuse that may\nl2 not necessarily involve violence in a way that is commonly\n\nl3 understood.\n\nl4 Q. And what is forensic psychology?\n\nl5 A. Forensic psychology is the application of the science of\n\nl6 psychology to a particular legal mater, so using -- using\n\nl7 psychology to answer or to assist a court in answering a legal\nl8 question.\n\nl9 Q. As part of your work in your connection with your master's\n2o and Ph.D. degrees, did you perform clinical work with patients?\n2l A. I did.\n22 Q. About hou much time did you spend working with patients?\n23 A.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\nae hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

Again, depending on the specific nature of the instability.\nl3 Q. People with Lou self-esteem, would that fall under the\nl4 category of particular vulnerabilities?\nl5 A.

People who abuse drugs and alcohol, are they ina\nl9 vulnerable position?\n2o A. Research in child and sexual abuse has looked more at the\n2l parental use of drugs and alcohol.

The first of these indices is whether “the core details” of an\naccusation remain constant over time. Jd. The second is that an alleged victim’s “<span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>\ndistress [is not] predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.” /d. at ll. And third, that victims\nof sexual assault “have higher rates of mental disorders,” which “can affect memory and recall.”\nId. As the Court explained in its opinion admiting Dr. Rocchio, “expert opinions that constitute\nevaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations are rooted in scientific or\ntechnical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2.” Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398. “And, a\nwitness’s demeanor on the stand . . . impacts the assessment of credibility” by the jury. United\nStates v. Lumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (emphasis added).\n\nWith this law in mind, the Defense explains that Dr. Dietz’s credibility testimony is\nrelevant primarily to argue that Dr. Rocchio improperly believed her clients’ claims of sexual\nabuse. Def. Br. at l3-l4. The Defense says that professionals in Dr. Rocchio’s field would\nevaluate their client’s claims in a clinical seting and that in a forensic seting Dr. Rocchio erred\nin believing alleged victim’s claims based on their outward emotions. /d.\n\nThe Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s opinions on witness credibility. First, they have only\nmarginal relevance. At the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio made clear that when serving clients in\nher clinical capacity, she does not “go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical\nroom.” Nov. lo Tr. at l6. As she explained, “in a clinical seting, it is not [her] role to\ndetermine whether something is or is not true.” /d. at 4o.

And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims. On the forensic side, Dr.\nRocchio takes on “an investigative role” and does not accept claims “at face value.” Nov. lo Tr.\nat l5. But Dr. Dietz’s opinion about evaluating victims’ credibility still has litle relevance to\nDr. Rocchio’s forensic evaluations. In explaining her method, Dr. Rocchio did not say that she\n“‘base[s] her opinions” on victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress. Def. Br. at l4. Rather, she testified that\nshe looks at a significant volume of documentation, conducts an 8 to lo-hour in-person\nevaluation, and “conduct[s] collateral interviews with others.” Nov. lo Tr. at 37-38. And\nconsistent with Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio said that she looks “for consistencies and\ninconsistencies in what the individual is telling [her] in order to form an opinion.” /d. at 39. In\nsum, Dr. Dietz’s opinion of determining witnesses’ credibility has litle relevance to rebut or\n“critique” Dr. Rocchio’s methods. Def. Br. at l3.\n\nSecond, there is a significant risk of prejudice. As explained, expert testimony that\nevaluates witnesses’ credibility is inadmissible. For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin\naffirmed the exclusion of an expert opinion that a witness’s “confidence in identification is not a\ngood predictor of accuracy” because it “would effectively have inserted [the expert’s] oun view\nof the [testifying witness’s] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.” l92\nF.3d at 288-89. Dr. Dietz’s opinions that the consistency of core details is predictive of accurate\nclaims and that <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress is not predictive of accuracy are very similar to the\n“demeanor” opinion excluded in Lumpkin.

In Press-Enter. Co., Chief Justice Burger further made clear that forced\ndisclosure of past sexual assault suffered by jurors gave rise to a “valid privacy right”. /d.\n\nIn United States v. King, the Second Circuit upheld the ruling by the louer court, which\nalloued parts of the record in that case to be sealed based on the jurors’ privacy interest in\nintensely personal subjects, as well as upheld the louer court’s finding that such interest was\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny King atracted from the press.

The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand impartial jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law enforcement,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from prospective jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand. In this case, Juror No. 5o gave untrue answers about\nthe fundamental issue of whether he himself had been victimized by sexual abuse and could be\nfair and impartial ina sexual abuse case.

Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited).

Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3. Nou, defendant Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal\ninvolvement in this far-research conspiracy. Kate clearly has a right to be heard as part of that\nprocess.\n\nAs this Court is aware, Kate was recognized in this case as a crime victim of a federally\ncharged criminal conspiracy against Ghislaine Maxwell for acts that Maxwell commited against\nKate when she was seventeen years old. While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel. No doubt, Kate has important insight into Maxwell’s role in a sex-\ntrafficking organization, the type that is helpful for any Court tasked with determining an\nappropriate sentence.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo738", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page4of23\n\nThe probative value of the anticipated testimony must of course be balanced with any\npotential prejudice under Rule 4o3. As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page5of23\ndescribed above. See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records.

You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions.

The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.).

These out of court statements would be hearsay if admited for their truth, and so are\npresumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 8o2. The Defense identifies several means by\nwhich it may admit these hearsay statements. Def. Br. at l4-l7.\n\nFirst, “[u]nder Rule 7o3, experts can testify to opinions based on inadmissible evidence,\nincluding hearsay, if ‘experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their\nopinions.’” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir. 2oo8). But Rule 7o3 does not\npermit an expert to “simply transmit that hearsay to the jury.” /d. Rather, those underlying facts\nand data that would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative\nvalue in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3. Here, the hearsay underlying Dr. Hall’s diagnoses, including\nPY would have litle probative value unless the\nGovernment were to challenge the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses. See United States v. Chai,\nNo. l3-CR-29o (PAC), 2ol5 WL 293995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2ol5). The Government\nrepresents in its brief that it would not do so in the event that Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are admited.\nGov’t Br. at l3. And admiting the underlying hearsay, without a relevant need to substantiate\nthe accuracy of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing\nthe jury and delaying the trial with a large volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore\nconcludes that, based on the parties’ current proffers, the facts and data underlying Dr. Hall’s\nopinions are not admissible via Rule 7o3.\n\nSecond, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements are admissible under one of\ntwo hearsay exceptions in Rule 8o3. Def. Br. at l5. It says the statements were statements of\nher “then-existing state of mind . . . or <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, sensory, or physical condition.” Fed. R. Evid.\n8o3(3). But while a number of Alleged Victim 4’s statements to Dr. Hall may pertain to motives\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Pagel5ofl7\nor <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> condition, her statements made to Dr. Hall ing about events that took place\nyears earlier cannot be said to be “then-existing.” /d. The Defense also says Alleged Victim 4’s\nstatements were “made for medical diagnosis or treatment.” Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4). The Court\nfinds that this may be a permissible basis for admiting some of Alleged Victim 4’s statements,\nthough they must be “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment,” must “describe[ ] medical\nhistory; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and must\notherwise satisfy Rules 4ol and 4o3. Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4)(A), (B); see In re Agent Orange\nProd. Liab. Litig., 6ll F. Supp. l223, l245-46 (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd sub nom., 8l8 F.2d l87\n(2d Cir. l987) (Weinstein, C.J.).! But without additional detail from the Defense on which\nportions of Dr. Hall’s testimony it would seek to admit under this exception, the Court cannot\nmake a definitive ruling.\n\nThe Defense does not mention Alleged Victim 4’s a cited by Dr. Hall in\nhis report. The Court concludes that Alleged Victim 4’s LF are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o9. Dr. Hall’s report is not clear on the details of Alleged Victim 4’s\nee\nes These incidents,\nhouever, are nou all over lo years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest act or false\nstatement,” and, for i. admiting the evidence is not necessary to fairly\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 6o9 (a), (b), (d).\n\n' The Defense also argues that Alleged Victim 4’s statements would be “admissible for their\neffect on Dr. Hall in forming his opinion.” Def. Br. at l5. But, like Rule 7o3, this justification is\na relevant basis for admission only if the validity of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses is put in question.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 8of9\npayments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant’s physical injuries, physical sickness and\nresulting <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress within the meaning of Section lo4(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nC.

No information\nprovided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s)\nand location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant\nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

This\n\n5 was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for\n\n6 turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire\n\n7 events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did\n\n8 not happen.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7**\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafaia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate... all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “‘as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021419.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 345 3536o38, Page247 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*\"3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO.

The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub. L. No. 97-29l (Victim and Witness Protection Act) (l982); Pub. L. No. 98-473 (Victims of Crime\nAct) (l984); Pub. L. No. lol-647 (Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act) (l99o); Pub. L.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2324o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023257.jpg": "have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023287.jpg": "(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI. DEPARTMENT POLICY: THE 2oo5 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR\n\nVICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2oo5 GUIDELINES)\n\nIn 2oo5, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to\nincorporate the provisions of the CVRA. The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA. Investigation Stage\n\nThe investigative agency’s responsibilities begin with the report of the crime and extend\n\nthrough the prosecution of the case. In some instances, when explicitly stated, the\n\ninvestigative agency’s responsibility for a certain task is transferred to the prosecuting\nagency when charges are filed.\n\n2.

The short answer is unequivocally, yes. To hold otherwise would be a\ndirect violation of Epstein’s constitutional due process rights.

As the court is aware, plaintiffs and defendants routinely atend depositions of |\nparties and other witnesses in both State and Federal court proceedings. In fact, parties have a :\n\nright under the law to atend such depositions.\n\n8. _ Ag the court will note from Exhibit 2, counsel for the Defendant specifically |\nstated that “Please be advised that Mr. Epstein plans to be in atendance at the deposition of your\nclient. He does not intend to engage in any conversation with your client.

The undersigned is well aware of the court’s No-Contact Order entered on July . .\n3l, 2oo9 (DE 238). A copy of the order is atached as Exhibit “3”.

This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y.

It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\nDs It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment,\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y.

As grounds for said motion, Jane Doe states as follous:\n\nl. On July l9, 2oo6 the State of Florida filed a criminal Indictment against Jeffrey\nEpstein (“Epstein”).\n\n2. Jane Doe, a victim of Epstein’s actions, recently filed a civil lawsuit against\nEpstein. The complaint alleges among other things that Epstein has a sexual preference and\nobsession for underage minor girls. That he engaged in a scheme in which he gained access to\nminor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Jane Doe was\none of Epstein’s victims. She was lured into Epstein’s Palm Beach home under false pretenses\nand was sexually assaulted by Epstein. As a result, Jane Doe suffered injuries, including\nintentional infliction of <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> distress damages.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 35 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l556", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031564.jpg": "- 3o5-93l22oo Herman &Mermelstein, P o4:24:o8 n,m. 3l-o3-2oo8 3/5\nno. o8-CV-8o232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District\nof Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\n5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, :\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s\ncircumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be\ndeposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued\non good cause shoun.”\n\n(3 This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal\ncase from potential <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> harm.

With regard to the depositions of our clients, it is necessary and\nappropriate for the entry of a court order which would require that one deposition be taken of\neach of our clients for use in both the criminal case and the civil case. A single deposition is\nwarranted given that the facts of the sexual assault are common to both the civil and criminal\ncases, and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is the same in both cases. A single deposition is in the\nbest interests of the <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> well being of the victim. In another case we were involved in\nwhere both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Atorney’s office filed a\nmotion for protective order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(l)(l) asking that\nthe depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time.\n\nWe would like to coordinate and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue\nconceming the depositions of our clients. The deposition of is presently\nscheduled for Wednesday, April 2, 2oo8. Please let us knou hou you would like to proceed in\nthis important mater as soon as possible.\n\nStuart S.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication. Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or\nNizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033231.jpg": "Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n; Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did not have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\nll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.jpg": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters, Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups.

It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein.

This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal\nauthorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation,\nas well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were identified through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been identified for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2324o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023257.tif": "have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”°3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had restitution rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[YJour leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023287.tif": "(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of a crime....\n\nI. DEPARTMENT POLICY: THE 2oo5 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR\n\nVICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2oo5 GUIDELINES)\n\nIn 2oo5, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to\nincorporate the provisions of the CVRA. The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice investigative,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA.

The short answer is unequivocally, yes. To hold otherwise would be a\ndirect violation of Epstein’s constitutional due process rights.

As the court is aware, plaintiffs and defendants routinely atend depositions of |\nparties and other witnesses in both State and Federal court proceedings. In fact, parties have a |\n\nright under the law to atend such depositions.\n\n8. _ Ag the court will note from Exhibit 2, counsel for the Defendant specifically |\nstated that “Please be advised that Mr. Epstein plans to be in atendance at the deposition of your\nclient.

Within her Amended Complaint and Answers to Interrogatories, .\nghe indicates that she went to Epstein’s house on several occasions.

While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span> levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n. Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did net have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\n: ll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.tif": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered <span class=\"highlight\">emotional</span>, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them\nl4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33234"};
