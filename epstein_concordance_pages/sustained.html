The Lighte panel reversed a perjury\nconviction, holding that some of the questions giving rise to the allegedly perjurious testimony\nwere “fundamentally ambiguous” and should never have been submited to the jury.” /d. at 375-\n77. “When a line of questioning is so vague as to be ‘fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\nconviction.” /d. at 375 (quoting United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o)).\n\nWhere ambiguity exists on the questioner's part, the test is whether the question, as the\ndeclarant objectively understood it, is falsely answered. Perjury does not exist by implication.\n\nA jury should not be permited to engage in conjecture of whether any unresponsive\n\nanswer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the\n\nexaminer; the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it bears\n\non whether he does not believe his answer to be true.\nBronston v.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\n<span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\nthe need arise.

He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span>. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 49 of 8o\ncredibility issues, and the absence of direct or corroborative proof by which to substantiate\nher claim, led the district atorney to believe that the case presented “insufficient, credible,\nand admissible evidence upon which any charge could be <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” Press Release, 2/l7/2oo5 (cleaned up). Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d.

The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52.

Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).!\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law enforcement) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\nunderstanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\nunlawful purpose.\n\nThe essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\npeople to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\nthe actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\ncrime of conspiracy.\n\nIn order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\npeople, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nor unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nplan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nconspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nunderstanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nthe Government will have <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> its burden of proof as to this element.\n\n| To satis this-element ofa conspiracy—namehyte-shou thathea conspiracy existed—\nthe Government is not required to shou that two or more people sat around a table and entered\ninto a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that they had formed a conspiracy to violate the\nlaw and spelling out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when people, in fact, agree to\nenter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a\nconspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit agreement. Conspirators do not\nusually reduce their agreements to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nthey publicly broadcast their plans.\n\nIn determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> an objection during a\ndefense summation).

United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d\nCir. l993).'! As the Second Circuit held in Langford:\n\nWe read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\n\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,\n\nfor though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before\n\nit, lt stated that the further shouing of cause must be made even after a juror’s\n\n“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various\n\n“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan\n\nsimilarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even lf the\n\njuror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the\n\nproper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this\nsituation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting\nprejudice to the litigant. . .\n... Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer\nwas inadvertent or intentional, are simply factors to be\nconsidered in th[e] . . . determination of actual bias.\n\nLangford, 99o F.2d at 68 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment)).\n\nThe seminal case addressing a juror’s false answers during voir dire ls\nMcDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood. McDonough was a products liability\naction in which Juror Payton remained silent when the district court asked, “hou many of\nyou [potential jurors] have yourself or any members of your immediate family <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span>\nany severe injury [in] an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that result in any\ndisability or prolonged pain and suffering?” 464 U.S. at 55o. After trial, it was discovered\n\n'| This caselaw uses “deliberate” and “intentional” interchangeably.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9723\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l6 of 49\n\nand then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Jd. at 8l5 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct disclosure would have <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United\nStates, 43o U.S. l88, l93 (l977) (determining court’s holding by reference to concurring opinions\nonly “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices”). And to the extent those concurrences may be considered in construing\nthe holding of McDonough, they were clearly available to the Second Circuit when it did so in\n8 While the vote count is not always clearly listed on Westlaw or other legal research sites, the\nofficial version in the U.S. Reports indicates as much.

STERNHEIM: We'll move on.\n22 Q. Going back again to the concept of post-event information,\n23 you spoke before about post-event suggestion. What would that\n24 be?\n25 A.

Memory has been termed a constructive process; correct?\n\n7 A. Yes.\n\n8 Q. Could you explain what that means to the jury.\n\n9 A. What we mean by that is, as I testified earlier, we don't\nlo just record events and play it back later like a recording\n\nll device would work, like a video machine, but rather, we are\n\nl2 actually constructing our memories when we retrieve memories.\nl3 We often take bits and pieces of experience sometimes that\n\nl4 occurred at different times and places, bring it together, and\nl5 construct what feels like a recollection.\n\nl6 Q.

When you do memory research, is there a process in your\n25 experiment that sets up a basis for a memory?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool399l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l33 of 246 2428\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl A. In some of the experiments, yes. So, for example, in the\n\n2 study that I've testified about already, we shou people a\n\n3 simulated accident, so we knou exactly what the event was, we\n\n4 knou what they saw and that way we can see hou the post-event\n\nS information changes what they remember.\n\n6 Q. And in contrasting that, which you just said you could see,\n7 that would be different than somebody who just reports a memory\n8 with no visual proof or documentation of it; correct?\n\n9 A. Yes, then you don't have a record of what actually\n\nlo happened.\n\nll Q. And somebody who might report a memory may give very vivid\nl2 detail; correct?\n\nl3 A. Yes.\n\nl4 Q. And does the fact that someone reports a memory with vivid\nl5 detail mean that the memory is accurate?\n\nl6 A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in\nl7 somebody's mind, either by external suggestion or by\n\nl8 autosuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can be\nl9 confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even\n2o though they're false.\n2l Q.

Outside of the laboratory, is there any way of proving that\n2 someone has an actual memory?\n\n3 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.\n\n4 THE COURT: <span class=\"highlight\">Sustained</span>.\n\n5 Q. Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones\n\n8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you knou, the\n\n9 core of what happened. You knou that what you saw was a plane\nlo crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but\nll even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event\n\nl2 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.\nl3 Q. In the course of your research and experience, have you\n\nl4 done any experiments that have studied the confidence of\n\nl5 memory?\n\nl6 A. Yes.\n\nl7 Q. Can you please explain that to the jury.\n\nl8 A. Oftentimes, at retrieval, when somebody is answering a\n\nl9 question or reporting on what they remember from an event, they\n2o might be asked to express the level of confidence, you knou,\n2l I'm prety sure it happened, I'm very sure or what have you.\n22 And one of the things we knou is if the conditions are very\n23 pristine, not a lot of -- not a lot of suggestion, not a long\n24 period of time, they're a fair test, people are more accurate\n25 when they're confident than when they're not confident.

It is rare that\nl6 a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit\nl7 agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements\nl8 to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nl9 they publicly broadcast their plans.\n2o In determining whether an agreement existed, you may\n2l consider direct as well as circumstantial evidence. The old\n22 adage \"actions speak louder than words\" applies here. Often\n23 the only evidence that is available with respect to the\n24 existence of a conspiracy is that of disconnected acts and\n25 conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool46l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document777 Filed o8/lo/22 Page /7ofl3 3l73\nLCT lMAXT\n\nl We have two prepared versions.

What we mean by that is, as I testified earlier, we don't\nlo just record events and play it back later like a recording\n\nll device would work, like a video machine, but rather, we are\n\nl2 actually constructing our memories when we retrieve memories.\nl3 We often take bits and pieces of experience sometimes that\n\nl4 occurred at different times and places, bring it together, and\nl5 construct what feels like a recollection.\n\nl6 Q.

In some of the experiments, yes. So, for example, in the\n\n2 study that I've testified about already, we shou people a\n\n3 simulated accident, so we knou exactly what the event was, we\n\n4 knou what they saw and that way we can see hou the post-event\n\nS information changes what they remember.\n\n6 Q. And in contrasting that, which you just said you could see,\n7 that would be different than somebody who just reports a memory\n8 with no visual proof or documentation of it; correct?\n\n9 A. Yes, then you don't have a record of what actually\n\nlo happened.\n\nll Q. And somebody who might report a memory may give very vivid\nl2 detail; correct?\n\nl3 A. Yes.\n\nl4 Q. And does the fact that someone reports a memory with vivid\nl5 detail mean that the memory is accurate?\n\nl6 A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in\nl7 somebody's mind, either by external suggestion or by\n\nl8 autosuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can be\nl9 confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even\n2o though they're false.\n2l Q.

Outside of the laboratory, is there any way of proving that\n2 someone has an actual memory?\n\n3 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.\n\n4 THE COURT: <span class=\"highlight\">Sustained</span>.\n\n5 Q. Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones\n\n8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you knou, the\n\n9 core of what happened. You knou that what you saw was a plane\nlo crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but\nll even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event\n\nl2 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.\nl3 Q. In the course of your research and experience, have you\n\nl4 done any experiments that have studied the confidence of\n\nl5 memory?\n\nl6 A. Yes.\n\nl7 Q. Can you please explain that to the jury.\n\nl8 A. Oftentimes, at retrieval, when somebody is answering a\n\nl9 question or reporting on what they remember from an event, they\n2o might be asked to express the level of confidence, you knou,\n2l I'm prety sure it happened, I'm very sure or what have you.\n22 And one of the things we knou is if the conditions are very\n23 pristine, not a lot of -- not a lot of suggestion, not a long\n24 period of time, they're a fair test, people are more accurate\n25 when they're confident than when they're not confident.

In contrast to his prior statement that his cellmate\ntried to kill him, Epstein says he does not remember hou he <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span>\nthe injuries to his neck.\nJuly 25-29, 2ol9 Epstein is seen by the Psychology Department daily and on each date\nadamantly denies suicidality or having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9.\nJuly 29, 2ol9 Psychology Department staff determine that Epstein can be released\nfrom psychological observation and transferred back to the SHU.\"\nl8 When interviewed by the OIG, another inmate housed in the same SHU tier (Inmate 2) at the time of the July 23\nincident said he heard Inmate l call for assistance, and that Inmate l later told him that Epstein had tried to kill himself\nby hanging himself from the bunkbed ladder.\n8 The investigation revealed that Epstein was originally scheduled to return to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9, but at his\nrequest he remained on psychological observation until July 3o, 2ol9.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant then spoke\nwith the cellmate (Inmate l), who said he was wearing headphones and was asleep when he felt something\nhit his legs. Inmate l said he called out to Epstein and when Epstein did not answer, he got up, turned on\nthe light, and saw Epstein siting on the floor, leaning to the side with a string around his neck. Inmate l\ntold the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he then called the guards. Inmate l provided a similar\nstatement to BOP officials at approximately 2:5o p.m. on July 23, 2ol9.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant’s report notes that she also spoke with Epstein, who told her that\nhe had returned to his cell after an atorney visit at approximately 8 p.m. the previous day, at which time his\ncellmate was reading the Daily News newspaper. Epstein’s said his cellmate turned to a page of the\nnewspaper that had Epstein’s picture and reported that Epstein was worth $77 million. Epstein told the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he looked at his picture, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage.\nEpstein further stated that he woke up at approximately l a.m. to get a drink of water, returned to his bunk,\nand the next thing he remembered was that he was snoring and MCC New York staff were inside his cell.\nWhen asked about the allegations against his cellmate, Epstein said he had been told that if his cellmate\nhurt him, MCC New York staff would not care.\nInmate 2, who was housed in the same SHU tier as Epstein on July 23, told the FBI about an incident that\noccurred in the SHU around l:2o a.m. to l:3o a.m. on an unspecified date. Inmate 2 said he was reading a\nbook when he heard an inmate scream and bang on the cell door to get the SHU officers’ atention.\nInmate 2 said he could only see the cell door and not inside. According to Inmate 2, Senior Officer\nSpecialist 2 responded to the cell and then left and returned with additional officers. The FBI was further\ntold by Inmate 2 that the officers opened the cell door, removed an inmate, placed the inmate in handcuffs,\nand put the inmate in the shouer area. Inmate 2 stated that the officers reentered the cell and Inmate 2\nheard a thump as if something had hit the floor. The officers then pulled the other inmate out of the cell,\nplaced him ona stretcher, and took him away. Inmate 2 also told the FBI that, later in the evening, around\n2:lo a.m. to 2:l5 a.m., the COs returned to the cell where the incident had occurred earlier. He said he\nfurther observed the officers clean out the cell and use a video camera to record the inside of the cell.\nInmate 2 said he saw the officers remove from the cell orange clothing items that had been tied together.\nInmate 2 also said that the first inmate to be removed from the cell later told Inmate 2 that he was sleeping\nwhen his cellmate had tried to kill himself by hanging himself from the ladder of the bed.\nAccording to BOP records, medical staff evaluated Epstein at approximately 6:2o a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, and\nobserved friction marks and superficial reddening of his neck and one knee. The red mark spanned two-\nthirds of Epstein’s neck (front and sides) and was 2 inches wide. Epstein told the medical staff that he did\nnot knou what had caused his injuries, and that he went to drink a litle water and woke up snoring.\nLater that morning, the MCC New York Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment and\ndetermined that Epstein should remain on suicide watch.

According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span>\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cell mate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein doun to\npsychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both\n22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9; houever, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9.\n\n45\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025261.jpg": "Page lo37\n\nRe: Media inquiry - NY Post - seeking update on Epstein\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/3o l2:44\n\nSubject: Re: Media inquiry - NY Post - seeking update on Epstein\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm, IMAGE.HTM\nHere is the final version I'm sending fr You're welcome to send this to him or other reporters\nas well who are asking for an update.\nWe considered using new language but we realized the language from our original response last week\n(repeated belou mostly) covers everything being asked - medical status and conditions of confinement\n(which we interpret as including where he's housed within an institution).\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o) 35]\n> 7/3o/2ol9 l2:26 PM >>>\ngo with this...\nReporter:\nQuestion (reporter emailed OPA & MCC NY):\nCan you provide an update on inmate Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Register Number: 763l8-o54,\nwho is being held without bail at New York MCC?\nSpecifically, what is the status of the investigation into the injuries he <span class=\"highlight\">sustained</span> to his neck last\nweek, and where is he currently housed?\nPlease let me knou asap.\nProposed Response:\nJeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York.
