It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied.

The\nindictment must be dismissed.\n\nThe government’s sudden zeal to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for alleged conduct with\nEpstein in the l99os—conduct for which the government never even charged Epstein—follous a\nhistory that is both highly unusual and deeply troubling. The government (and state authorities)\ninvestigated Epstein thoroughly in 2oo6 for alleged conduct that is essentially identical to the\nconduct alleged in the current indictment. In 2oo7, the government’s investigation was resolved\nwhen it entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Epstein, which was negotiated\nunder the supervision of R. Alexander Acosta, then United States Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”), and approved by senior levels of Main Justice, including the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General. In that NPA, the government agreed that any federal\nprosecution of Epstein in the SDFL would be deferred in exchange for Epstein’s agreement to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo273o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 239\ninvestigatory conduct is very heavy, see United States v.

Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span>\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.''

And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC.

Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span>\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

She declines recreation time to avoid being searched,\nwhich has negatively impacted her physical health. She was denied an extra blanket in the\nwinter, and, on more than one occasion, an officer took one of her blankets from her after her\nrequest for an extra blanket was granted. She was not provided a proper food regimen for the\nfirst few months she was incarcerated, wherein she was provided with small, inadequate portions\nor roten food. She has lost at least l5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair\nloss. Currently, she suffers from headaches and back pain and general physical weakness.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s guards shine flashlights on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute intervals\nand have done so every night since she has been incarcerated. As reported by the government,\n“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because the defendant, while not on\nsuicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule because MDC has identified a number of\nfactors that raise heightened safety and security concerns with respect to this defendant.” (Dkt.\n27o.)

The Government will not contend\nat trial that the defendant personally participated in the abuse of all of Epstein’s victims, and it is\nnot a defense to claim that the defendant is not guilty of crimes with which she is not charged.\nThis Court has already said as much. In the defendant’s pretrial motions, she alleged pre-\nindictment delay on the grounds that the lead detective from the Palm Beach Police Department\ninvestigating Epstein “revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms.\nMaxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect.” (Mem. of Law, Dkt. l38 at lo-ll).\nThe Court rejected this argument, explaining that the testimony the defendant suggested that the\ndetective might have offered “is propensity evidence that does nothing to establish her innocence\nof the charged offenses.” (Opinion & Order, Dkt. 2o7 at l8); see United States v.

Never before that time and never again in the roughly\n2o-year period since the conduct underlying this case occurred has Ms. Maxwell ever been accused\nof a crime, much less a scheme to sexually abuse minors. The witnesses at trial testified about Ms.\nMaxwell’s facilitation of Epstein’s abuse, but Epstein was always the central figure: Epstein was\nthe mastermind, Epstein was the principal abuser, and Epstein orchestrated the crimes for his\npersonal gratification. Indeed, had Ghislaine Maxwell never had the profound misfortune of\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein over 3o years ago, she would not be here.\n\nEpstein avoided a significant sentence when he was first prosecuted in Florida for these\noffenses and then evaded any further punishment by dying a month after his arrest and detention\nin New York. But this Court cannot sentence Ms. Maxwell as if she were a proxy for Epstein\nsimply because Epstein is no longer here. Ms. Maxwell cannot and should not bear all the\npunishment for which Epstein should have been held responsible.

She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food.

Because of these efforts, Ms. Maxwell can nou\npresent the follouing additional information in support of her renewed bail application:\n\n¢ Leter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse. This leter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has\npouerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the\ncommited relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, who ls a U.S citizen,\nand hou they lived a quiet family life together ira in the\nUnited States for over four years immediately prior to her arrest.

The financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins\nLimited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell’s financial condition from 2ol5-\n2o2o, and discloses (i) all of her oun assets, (ll) all assets held in trust, and (ll) all of\nthe assets held by her spouse over that same time period.

It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020974.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel48 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\n\naspect of Questions 48 and 49.

She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span>\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025116.jpg": "Page 754\n\nInstitution Response: 3.

Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being <span class=\"highlight\">threatened</span> and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.
