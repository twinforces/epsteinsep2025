Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts.”\nExhibit 2, Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla. July 5, 2ol3),\nDkt. 2o5-2, at 9. The government went so far as to invite the alleged victims “to contact the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government atorneys\nin those offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged\nfederal crimes commited against them.” /d. at lo. The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions. See id. at lo n.9.\n\nThe defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and\nexecute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two\nvenues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication)\noccurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same\nprosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of\nwhat in fact was a single criminal <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>. What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest. During that time, as noted by the\ngovernment, he engaged in substantial international travel, always returning to his residences in\nthe United States. Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee. This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions\nregarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges\npending against him.\n\nOn September 24, 2oo7, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice,\nthrough the United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), entered\ninto the NPA with Mr. Epstein. The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential\nfederal charges that “may have been commited by Epstein . . . from in or around 2ool through\nin or around September 2oo7.” Exhibit l, NPA, at l-2. One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added).

There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims. We\n2l think the number is far less than what the government asserts.\n22 But even taking that number, it's a number far louer than that\n23 in Khashoggi, far louer than that in Dreier, far louer than in\n24 many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,\n25 should be addressed by bail conditions.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001071.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel3o of 2oo 67\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl originally without prejudice obviously for precisely the\n\n2 proceeding we are having, but it sounded like you were\n\n3 suggesting that her current detention was in some way by design\n4 to prevent you from providing a full picture of her financial\n\n5 situation.

In other words, her federal indictment may\n\ni) well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's\n\n4 resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a\n\n5 substantial actual risk of flight.\n\n6 Having made this determination, the court next turns\n\n7 to whether the government has met its burden to shou by a\n\n8 preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions\n9 could reasonably assure the defendant's presence. The court is\nlo persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes\nll that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\nl2 insufficient.\n\nl3 As an initial mater, the financial component of\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a\n\nl5 relatively small component of the access available to her and\nl6 is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about\n\nl7 several million dollars.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n24 observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not\n25 prevent flight. At best it limits a fleeing defendant's head\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001195.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholo2o 7A ile@ 42738) 26a deagect d Ob l5\nThe report shous nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 8 of lo\n\nIn addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that\nwould enable her flight from prosecution.

In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn connection with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9. It is unknoun whether the defendant purchased the\nproperty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool622\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 29 of 9l 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> in New Hampshire.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> under a fake name and not be detected.

There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims.

In other words, her federal indictment may\n\ni) well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's\n\n4 resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a\n\n5 substantial actual risk of flight.\n\n6 Having made this determination, the court next turns\n\n7 to whether the government has met its burden to shou by a\n\n8 preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions\n9 could reasonably assure the defendant's presence. The court is\nlo persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes\nll that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\nl2 insufficient.\n\nl3 As an initial mater, the financial component of\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a\n\nl5 relatively small component of the access available to her and\nl6 is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about\n\nl7 several million dollars. But even a substantially larger\n\nl8 package would be insufficient. The extent of her financial\n\nl9 resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank\n2o accounts discussed in the government's submission and here\n2l today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full\n22 accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial\n23 situation. She has provided the court with scarce information\n24 about the financial information of her proposed cosigners, for\n25 example.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n24 observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not\n25 prevent flight.

Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security.

R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\ncircumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v.

By placing calls from his landline, the Court reasoned, Smith\n“voluntarily conveyed” the dialed numbers to the telephone company by “expos[ing] that\ninformation to its equipment in the ordinary course of business.” 442 U.S. at 744. The Court held\nthat Smith has “assumed the risk” that the telephone company’s records “would be divulged to\npolice.” /d. at 745.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Miller, the Court ruled that the government could subpoena\nan individual’s bank records, including several months of canceled checks, deposit slips, and\nmonthly statements. The Court explained that because the checks were “not confidential\ncommunications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions,” and because\nthe bank statements contained information “exposed to [bank] employees in the ordinary course\nof business,” Miller had only a limited expectation of privacy. 425 U.S. at 442.

Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail to include an express\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2659\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 239\ndefendant, in 2oo3, Congress wanted to ensure that every perpetrator who abused a minor in the\nfuture was subject to prosecution for the lifetime of the minor, but Congress simultaneously was\ncontent to let all previous perpetrators avoid prosecution whenever their victims turned twenty-\nfive. No such intent is manifest in either the text or in Senator Leahy’s statement.\n\nThe reach of Section 3283 is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the statute\nof limitations to pre-enactment conduct, the Court should resolve its analysis at Landgraf step one\nand apply the statute as Congress intended. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—at worst—\nambiguous. Ifthe Court takes that view, it should proceed to Landgraf step two.\n\n2s The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step Two of Landgraf\n\nIf the Court were to determine that the legislative intent behind Section 3283 is ambiguous,\nthe inquiry then extends to the second step of the Landgraf analysis, which examines the\nretroactive effects of the statute. As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, “[a] statute does\nnot operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating\nthe statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations based in prior law.” 5ll U.S. at 269. Instead, the\nquestion is whether the statute “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\nparty’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already\ncompleted.” Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995)\n(quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o). Applying Section 3283 here would have none of those\neffects. Maxwell’s rights, liabilities, and duties were governed by the substantive criminal statutes\ngoverning her conduct. Until the statute of limitations expired, Maxwell had the same legal\nliability, the same rights, and the same incentives to retain evidence. A statute extending that\nperiod ataches no new legal consequences; rather, it preserves the status quo. Therefore, the\nstatute does not operate “retrospectively” within the meaning of Landgraf. See Cruz v. Maypa,\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s exception to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v.

Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed\n\nThe Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse\nminors, and with commiting perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are\nproperly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a\ncommon scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second\njury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a\nsecond time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by shouing substantial prejudice from the\njoinder. She has not done so, and the severance motion should be denied.\n\nA.

R. Crim. P. 8(a). This rule establishes three\ntests for joinder, each “reflect[ing] a policy determination that gains in trial efficiency outweigh\nthe recognized prejudice that accrues to the accused.” United States v.

The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate.

(Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary. Consideration of such authority compels application of § 3283 by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue, and even under the definition of “sexual abuse” the\ngovernment proposes, none of the elements of either § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) constitutes sexual\nabuse.\n\nl, The 2oo3 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively.\n\nThe government does not dispute that Landgraf is the appropriate framework for\ndetermining whether a statute applies retroactively. Opp. 27. Under Landgraf, the first step is\n“to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach”; if it has,\nthere is no need to proceed further. 55l U.S. at 28o. Ifit has not, the court must determine\n“whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties\nwith respect to transactions already completed.” Jd.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3659\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003690.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7.

Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.

The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed.

Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page6ofl7\n\nA. The Counts are Dissimilar and Illogically and Artificially Connected.\n\nThe government claims that the Perjury Counts are properly joined because they are\n“logically connected” to the Mann Act Counts and part of the same “common plan or scheme.”\nResp. at l38, l4l, l43. No logic can be gleaned from the government’s response. Offenses are\nor “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of related\ntransactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996).\n\nHere, the Perjury Counts did not “grou out of” the conduct underlying the Mann Act\nCounts. Ms. Maxwell’s depositions occurred in 2ol6, twenty years after the conduct alleged in\nthe Mann Act Counts purportedly occurred from l994-l997. Furthermore, the allegations\nunderlying the two sets of counts are unrelated. The “scheme” alleged in the Indictment is the\nalleged enticement of three females to travel for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts\nbetween l994 and l997. The depositions at the heart of the Perjury Counts concerned the truth or\nfalsity of Virginia Giuffre’s “obvious lies” about being sexually trafficked to famous people and\nher purported four years as a sex slave. None of the Accusers in the Indictment claim to have\nbeen sexually trafficked by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell to anyone, let alone any famous people.\n\nAnd the defamation case had nothing to do with any allegations by Ms. Giuffre of being enticed\nto travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Hou Ms. Maxwell’s answers to questions in 2ol6 about\nthe falsity of Ms. Giuffre’s sex trafficking claims (years after the allegations in the Indictment)\nare related to the conspiracies alleged in the Indictment is therefore a mystery.!\n\n' There is also no evidence that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein conspired or agreed to lie in the\ndefamation case. After Ms. Maxwell compelled Epstein to sit for a deposition in the defamation action, he\nasserted his right against self-incrimination and declined to answer any questions. Ms. Maxwell, having\ncommited no crime and not being a part of any conspiracy with Epstein, chose to answer questions\ntruthfully. No charges were pending against either Epstein or Ms. Maxwell at the time of the depositions\nand there was no relationship between the two individuals.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page8ofl7\ninvestigating the underlying charged conspiracy); United States v.

Nor did the allegedly false statements concern the Mann Act Counts, which are\nbased on allegations of enticing women to travel in interstate commerce for an illegal sexual\npurpose between l994 and l997. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to questions about, for example,\nwhether she could give a list of people under the age of l8 who came to Epstein’s house or\nwhether she could identify sex toys—which she made in the context of a 2ol6 defamation claim\nbrought by an unrelated person—do not “concern” the Mann Act Counts.\n\nThe government contends that the fact that Ms. Maxwell made these statements in the\ncontext of a civil deposition, as opposed to a criminal investigation, “is of litle moment” because\nshe was supposedly “concerned about the prospect of a criminal investigation at the time of her\ndepositions.” Resp. at l45.

One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request.

At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate.

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v.

The rape\nallegations are irrelevant to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6923\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page57 of l27 57\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl the same <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> or series of transactions as the charged\n\n2 offenses, they're not inextricably intertwined with the\n\n3 evidence nor necessary to complete the story of the crime on\n\n4 trial.

See ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 88:5-l6.\nDespite being given these clearly defined tasks, the government spends a significant portion of its\nNovember 5 leter rearguing its position that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is direct evidence\nof the Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. See ll/5/2o2l\nLtr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to transport minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added). In so finding, the Court rejected all of the reasons\nthat the government offers (again) to admit this evidence as direct proof of the Mann Act\nconspiracies.

It assumes a tax loss amount of $l.5 billion\nand adds “points” for sophisticated means (§ 2Tl.l(b)(2)) and special skill (§ 3Bl.3).

If that is so, then the proper loss\ncalculation is this:\n\nColeman $2,738,63o\n\nBlair $ 47o,o35\n\nAronoff $ 536,77o\n\nToporek h  '62:553\n\nTOTAL $3,8o7,988\nThese numbers are based on the additional assessments calculated by the IRS, which are in\nevidence.\n\nMoreover, if the Guidelines calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”\ntransactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is\ntoo thin a reed to support this enhancement.\n\nIf all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a\nGuidelines range of 5l to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a\nrange that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2oo5 U.S. Dist.

Rev. l3l5, l328 (2oo5)(“[aJt or\nnear the root of virtually every serious criticism of the guidelines is the concern that they are too\nharsh”).\nF. Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009518.jpg": "Case D28o BoGRR PAECUN BOC amentl6l6622o lRildd BAlZA/2P ag Pagef9S of ll7\nA-5942\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l3 of l4\n\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\n\nThe Honorable William H.

He has already suffered greatly for\nthat conduct. Since 2oo4, when the criminal investigation commenced, this mater has hung over\nhim. His once-thriving brokerage business has collapsed. His wife’s health has suffered. See\nsupra n.3. His children have felt the sting of comments from others who have learned of David's\nconviction. And the stigma of the conviction haunts David, especially because it is antithetical\nto the values with which he was raised. See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v.

Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive\nVice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family\nin l998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose\nof their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would\nreceive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an\nAltheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the\nCalphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently atended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon\nshareholders, and several atorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that\nmeeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-\nflag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that\nthe shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ oun investment advisors or\naccountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the\nshareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that\nthe profit potential was very lou and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were\nquestioned about the mater, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax\nshelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.\n6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is\nwholly inconsistent with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.\n\n* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-\nterm duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific\nTreasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce\nonly a small loss or gain on this purported “investment.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo953o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009531.jpg": "Case lf2oser3oo33o& AbcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed Ggeah Pageagei42 of ll7\n‘A-6o8o\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 7 of 4l\n2.

The losses Parse created —\n$3,ooo,ooo — were larger than Parse needed for the 2ooo year, suggesting that he intended to\neliminate taxes in more than one year. On his 2ooo tax return, Parse claimed a $l,278,7o6\nfraudulent loss, evading $5l7,542 in taxes on over $2.l million in income. See GX lool-l32 (Parse\n2ooo Tax Return); GX looo-52 (IRS Certificate of Assessment and Payments for Parse’s 2ooo\nTaxes); GX 54-l (J&G Opinion Leter for Parse). Parse's receipt of a free opinion leter, which\nwould have otherwise cost him no less than $9o,ooo (and likely more)’ had he paid the going rate\nfor a J&G opinion leter, violated Deutsche Bank's gift prohibition policy and almost certainly\nviolated the law, in that it constituted his receipt of an unlawful commission or gift by a bank\nofficial. See l8 U.S.C. § 2l5 (unlawful for any bank employee to accept anything of value intended\nto be rewarded in connection with business of bank).\n\n3. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Backdating of Transactions\n\nAs detailed in paragraphs 44-52 of the PSR, Parse’s conduct involved not only assisting in\nthe design, marketing, and implementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the\nimplementation of fraudulently backdated when Donna Guerin and others at J&G realized that the\nshelters had been implemented incorrectly, or not consistent with the clients’ wishes with respect to\n\n> Parse executed a $3,ooo,ooo short options deal through J&G. Using a conservative 3%\nfee results in a $9o,ooo opinion leter value. Parse only deducted just over $l.2 million of the\n$3,ooo,ooo in losses on his 2ooo return, and thus had available just under $l.8 million in losses to\nuse on future tax returns. Although Parse ultimately did not utilize those additional losses (because\nhe reversed his oun <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> when the IRS began investigating), the proper view of Parse’s oun\nfraudulent <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> should take into account the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo953l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009532.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas Co8l.

It is useful\nto note, houever, the follouing facts as they relate to Parse: (l) Parse was the key to the success of\nthe backdated transactions — without his agreement and participation, the J&G atorneys were\npouerless to correct the mistakes; (i) the corrections needed for the Aronoff transactions are\nreflected in David Parse’s oun handwriting on GX 4ol-99 (reflecting the original <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>) and\nGX 4ol-loo (reflecting the revised <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>), shouing that he fully understood the nature of the\nbackdating; (ll) the correction of the transactions required a complex series of steps, including\nreversals of transfers of assets between accounts, reversals of already-completed stock and foreign\ncurrency transactions, and execution of new “as of” foreign currency and stock trades; and (iv) the\nbackdating occurred with not just one client, but several and occurred in two different tax years —\ntax year 2ooo for the Aronoff family members, and tax year 2ool for Michael Toporek, Greg Blair,\nand Mathew Coleman.\n\nIn his sentencing memorandum, Parse atempts to excuse the backdating by claiming, “He\ngave no investment advice, and the trades were executed by his assistant.” (Parse Sent. Mem. at l2).\nThis statement is not only a shameless atempt by Parse to throu his subordinate under the bus, but\nalso a testament as to just hou perverted these tax shelters were that the investment broker, who\notherwise touts his treatment of his long-time clients, (id. at 4 “As a broker, David had 3o to 4o long-\nterm customers, and his goal was to assist them to invest their money wisely.”), nou atempts to\nmake much of the fact that he was not giving investment advice to the backdating clients (or, as the\nevidence shoued, to any of the other tax shelter clients). As to Parse’s suggestion that the\nbackdating transactions were done not by Parse, but by Carrie Yackee, his sales assistant (Parse\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9532\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009533.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas 6o82.

Given the foregoing, Parse’s\natempt to blame her for his criminal conduct is inconsistent with the facts; it is also, in a larger\n\nsense, inexcusable.\n\nTo the extent that Parse trial and current counsel have suggested and continue to suggest that\nthe backdating transactions were approved by Deutsche Bank, the only approvals were from Parse\nhimself, and on some of the trade tickets, the signature of the branch manager appears.’ Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that the branch manager knew of the purpose and animus for the backdated\ntransactions. To the extent that a branch manager actually knew what was occurring, that fact would\nonly render the branch manager a co-conspirator, and not excuse Parse’s criminal conduct.\n\nHouever complex the tax shelters, the fraudulent backdating was nothing more than garden-\nvariety fraud commited to achieve impermissible tax results. Basic principles of tax reporting —\nsuch as the annual accounting rule — prohibit the changing of tax results through transactions\ncarried out after the close of the tax year.

As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels. As calculated by Probation, the final offense level is 4o, calling for a Sentencing Guidelines\nsentence at the statutory maximum, 23 years’ imprisonment. PSR 4 lo3.

The defendant—who herself knous about the\nnature of the financial transactions between herself and Epstein—fails to indicate or suggest what\nthe financial documents would have shoun.

Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v.

While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have\nbeen imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.\nSentencing Mem. l3-l6, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this\ncase different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing\ntrades. Indeed, to our knouledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins\nand other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and\nhe is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010197.jpg": "CebasPAROAS URE DANN l Demo PRS mi Giaew o Fie DUP? ab dey @ SoF afll7l 7\nA-5942\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o4 _ Filed o3/l6/l3 Page l3 of l4\n\nyA ZUCKERMAN SPAEDER up\n\nThe Honorable William H.

See leter of Theresa Parse (“our lives [have] essentially\n[been] placed on hold, as we try to raise our three sons in a safe and secure environment”).\nMore than l5 years ago, the United States Supreme Court reminded that the\n“uniform and constant ... tradition for the sentencing judge [is] to consider every convicted\nperson as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes\nmitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.” Koon v. United States,\n5l8 U.S. 8l, ll3 (l996). In this submission, we have tried to shou that David Parse is a\nfundamentally decent man. He believes in family, hard work, helping others, and being actively\ninvolved in community. The conduct for which he was convicted, we believe, was at the\nperiphery of the Jenkins scheme. On this record, we respectfully submit that a non-incarcerative\nsentence would be just. It would not diminish respect for the law. See United States v.

Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive\nVice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family\nin l998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose\nof their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would\nreceive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an\nAltheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the\nCalphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently atended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon\nshareholders, and several atorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that\nmeeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-\nflag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that\nthe shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ oun investment advisors or\naccountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the\nshareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that\nthe profit potential was very lou and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were\nquestioned about the mater, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax\nshelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.\n6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is\nwholly inconsistent with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.\n\n* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-\nterm duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific\nTreasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce\nonly a small loss or gain on this purported “investment.”\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010210.jpg": "Cabs i2o2 Ordo RESD AS Nr emnreet 6 S82 Fibs OS OOP PaR RH el2l Af afll7l 7\nA-6o8o\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 7 of 4l\n2. Parse’s Personal Tax Evasion\n\nParse executed his oun fraudulent SOS tax shelter <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> to eliminate the gains he\neared in 2ooo, and received a free fraudulent opinion leter from J&G. The losses Parse created —\n$3,ooo,ooo — were larger than Parse needed for the 2ooo year, suggesting that he intended to\neliminate taxes in more than one year. On his 2ooo tax return, Parse claimed a $l,278,7o6\nfraudulent loss, evading $5l7,542 in taxes on over $2.l million in income. See GX lool-l32 (Parse\n2ooo Tax Return); GX looo-52 (IRS Certificate of Assessment and Payments for Parse’s 2ooo\nTaxes); GX 54-l (J&G Opinion Leter for Parse). Parse's receipt of a free opinion leter, which\nwould have otherwise cost him no less than $9o,ooo (and likely more)’ had he paid the going rate\nfor a J&G opinion leter, violated Deutsche Bank's gift prohibition policy and almost certainly\nviolated the law, in that it constituted his receipt of an unlawful commission or gift by a bank\nofficial. See l8 U.S.C. § 2l5 (unlawful for any bank employee to accept anything of value intended\nto be rewarded in connection with business of bank).\n\n3. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Backdating of Transactions\n\nAs detailed in paragraphs 44-52 of the PSR, Parse’s conduct involved not only assisting in\nthe design, marketing, and implementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the\nimplementation of fraudulently backdated when Donna Guerin and others at J&G realized that the\nshelters had been implemented incorrectly, or not consistent with the clients’ wishes with respect to\n\n> Parse executed a $3,ooo,ooo short options deal through J&G. Using a conservative 3%\nfee results in a $9o,ooo opinion leter value. Parse only deducted just over $l.2 million of the\n$3,ooo,ooo in losses on his 2ooo return, and thus had available just under $l.8 million in losses to\nuse on future tax returns. Although Parse ultimately did not utilize those additional losses (because\nhe reversed his oun <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> when the IRS began investigating), the proper view of Parse’s oun\nfraudulent <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> should take into account the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010211.jpg": "ST CSCS\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 8 of 4l\nthe amount or nature of the tax loss.\n\nThe facts concerning all of the backdating will not be repeated at length herein. It is useful\nto note, houever, the follouing facts as they relate to Parse: (l) Parse was the key to the success of\nthe backdated transactions — without his agreement and participation, the J&G atorneys were\npouerless to correct the mistakes; (i) the corrections needed for the Aronoff transactions are\nreflected in David Parse’s oun handwriting on GX 4ol-99 (reflecting the original <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>) and\nGX 4ol-loo (reflecting the revised <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>), shouing that he fully understood the nature of the\nbackdating; (ll) the correction of the transactions required a complex series of steps, including\nreversals of transfers of assets between accounts, reversals of already-completed stock and foreign\ncurrency transactions, and execution of new “as of” foreign currency and stock trades; and (iv) the\nbackdating occurred with not just one client, but several and occurred in two different tax years —\ntax year 2ooo for the Aronoff family members, and tax year 2ool for Michael Toporek, Greg Blair,\nand Mathew Coleman.\n\nIn his sentencing memorandum, Parse atempts to excuse the backdating by claiming, “He\ngave no investment advice, and the trades were executed by his assistant.” (Parse Sent. Mem. at l2).\nThis statement is not only a shameless atempt by Parse to throu his subordinate under the bus, but\nalso a testament as to just hou perverted these tax shelters were that the investment broker, who\notherwise touts his treatment of his long-time clients, (id. at 4 “As a broker, David had 3o to 4o long-\nterm customers, and his goal was to assist them to invest their money wisely.”), nou atempts to\nmake much of the fact that he was not giving investment advice to the backdating clients (or, as the\nevidence shoued, to any of the other tax shelter clients). As to Parse’s suggestion that the\nbackdating transactions were done not by Parse, but by Carrie Yackee, his sales assistant (Parse\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010212.jpg": "ce mer a; ane el\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 9 of 4l\nSentencing Mem, at l2), the evidence shoued and Yackee testified persistently, consistently, and\ncredibly that she acted at all times at the instruction of David Parse. Given the foregoing, Parse’s\natempt to blame her for his criminal conduct is inconsistent with the facts; it is also, in a larger\nsense, inexcusable.\n\nTo the extent that Parse trial and current counsel have suggested and continue to suggest that\nthe backdating transactions were approved by Deutsche Bank, the only approvals were from Parse\nhimself, and on some of the trade tickets, the signature of the branch manager appears.’ Moreover,\nthere is no evidence that the branch manager knew of the purpose and animus for the backdated\ntransactions. To the extent that a branch manager actually knew what was occurring, that fact would\nonly render the branch manager a co-conspirator, and not excuse Parse’s criminal conduct.\n\nHouever complex the tax shelters, the fraudulent backdating was nothing more than garden-\nvariety fraud commited to achieve impermissible tax results. Basic principles of tax reporting —\nsuch as the annual accounting rule — prohibit the changing of tax results through transactions\ncarried out after the close of the tax year. Carrie Yackee testified that she understood, based on her\n\n* Yackee made clear that the “Deutsche Bank approvals” on the backdated <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> were\nactually instructions from David Parse:\n\nQ.

On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels.

As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42).

Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v.

The sale agreement is a contract between the defendant herself and third parties. If a copy\nof the agreement was not in her personal possession, it surely was obtainable through her counsel\nin that <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span>—who is expected to testify at trial.\n\nSecond, as noted, the theory of relevance for the sale agreement that the Government\nanticipates has been clear since long before the defendant’s Rule l6 deadline.

See 35l3-o37 at 8 (FBI 3o2); 35l3-o38 at l2 (underlying notes). Although Kate did\nnot give the street address, she identified the house’s location as across the street from the Nags\nHead Pub. That fact did not go unnoticed by the defense, which made a point of confirming with\nKate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on Kinnerton Street across from\nthe Nags Head Pub—twice. Tr. l235, l253-54. Even before the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial, the defense previewed its view that Kate’s timeline is incorrect and she was older at the\ntime of certain events than she testified she was. See ll/ol/2l Tr. at 89 (“It’s quite possible, in\nfact likely, that [Kate] is older than [l7].””). The defense has been planning to challenge Kate’s\ntestimony on this point for quite some time, and it knew that Kate said she visited the Kinnerton\nStreet home.

Based on the Government’s investigation to date, the\nGovernment has identified more than l5 different bank accounts held by or associated with the\ndefendant from 2ol6 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those\naccounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $2o\nmillion. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of\nhundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as\nrecently as 2ol9. For example, the defendant transferred $5oo,ooo from one of her accounts to\nanother in March 2ol9, and transferred more than $3oo,ooo from one of her accounts to another\nin July 2ol9. She has also reported, including as recently as 2ol9, that she holds one or more\nforeign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars.\n\nThe defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2ol6 property sale.\nIn particular, in 2ol6, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $l5\nmillion through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling\nmore than $l4 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as\nthe ouner. Several days later, more than $l4 million was transferred from that account into\nanother account opened in the name of the defendant.” In short, the defendant’s financial resources\nappear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her\ntotal financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to\nthe Government.\n* The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring\nbetween 2oo7 and 2oll, approximately more than $2o million was transferred from accounts\nassociated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in\nthe millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with\nEpstein.\n\nPi\nDOJ-OGR-oool987l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019914.jpg": "CaSade2ZOtehQd3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL) 26a Geagpeot 2 GP l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’). In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn connection with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9. It is unknoun whether the defendant purchased the\nproperty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019951.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page92 of 2oo 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> in New Hampshire.

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so. All of those things should be extremely\n\n8 concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates\n\n9 whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live\nlo off the grid indefinitely. A year is an extremely long period\nll of time to live in hiding, undetected by the public. And so\n\nl2 all of those things are concerning.\n\nl3 With respect to the question of motive, your Honor,\n\nl4 the government submits the court need not reach that ultimate\nl5 issue, but we noted, your Honor, that there are indicia during\nl6 the circumstances of the defendant's arrest that suggested that\nl7 there was a motive to evade detection by law enforcement.

The government claims our client cleared $l4 million\n\nl6 from that in 2ol6 and apparently has it all today, which would\nl7 probably make it the first New York real estate <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> to\nl8 that effect. There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims. We\n2l think the number is far less than what the government asserts.\n22 But even taking that number, it's a number far louer than that\n23 in Khashoggi, far louer than that in Dreier, far louer than in\n24 many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,\n25 should be addressed by bail conditions.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019989.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel3o of 2oo 67\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl originally without prejudice obviously for precisely the\n\n2 proceeding we are having, but it sounded like you were\n\n3 suggesting that her current detention was in some way by design\n4 to prevent you from providing a full picture of her financial\n\n5 situation.

What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client.

That's the point we are making.\n2o THE COURT: Okay.\n2l MR. COHEN: One last point in that regard, your Honor,\n22 in the schedule we set today -- thank you, your Honor, for\n23 approving that -- the government is saying that it needs at\n24 least until November to complete all discovery, including\n25 electronic discovery.

In other words, her federal indictment may\n\ni) well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's\n\n4 resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a\n\n5 substantial actual risk of flight.\n\n6 Having made this determination, the court next turns\n\n7 to whether the government has met its burden to shou by a\n\n8 preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions\n9 could reasonably assure the defendant's presence. The court is\nlo persuaded that the government has met this burden and concludes\nll that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\nl2 insufficient.\n\nl3 As an initial mater, the financial component of\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell's proposed bail package appears to represent a\n\nl5 relatively small component of the access available to her and\nl6 is secured only by a foreign property said to be worth about\n\nl7 several million dollars. But even a substantially larger\n\nl8 package would be insufficient. The extent of her financial\n\nl9 resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank\n2o accounts discussed in the government's submission and here\n2l today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full\n22 accounting or even a close to full accounting of her financial\n23 Situation. She has provided the court with scarce information\n24 about the financial information of her proposed cosigners, for\n25 example.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n24 observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not\n25 prevent flight. At best it limits a fleeing defendant's head\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ooo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020113.jpg": "Caseeb2e-cre6o8BGuAUNNnt BEcunet lo8 2 FileG622/23/2thgPagetLOsef l5\nThe report shous nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page’ of 92\n\nCAo2db Intake\nFrom: NYSD_ECF_Pool@nysd.uscourts.gov\nSent: Thursday, July 7, 2o22 l2:o8 PM\nTo: NYSD CourtMail\nSubject: Activity in Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN USA v.

It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose.

October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS.

Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case.

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger.

A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3.

As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n33 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\n34 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023154.tif": "Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail. ...\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023160.tif": "Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or <span class=\"highlight\">transaction</span> involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[ml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023655.jpg": "PP4l Page l of l\nNYMB8 535.ol o8-28-2ol9\nPAGE ool OF ool * INMATE LOAD DATA * o9:39:29\nREG NO: 763l8-o54 NAME: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD\nRSP OF: NYM-NEW YORK MCC DOB(AGE): ol-2o-l953(66)\nRACE....: WHITE\nFBI NO..: SEX.....!

He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028954.tif": "eT ~ 7 ~ - - _ a |\nDRAFT REQUEST FORM INSTRUCTIONS\nREQUESTING EMPLOYEE - Complete blocks l to l3 as follous:\n: ] - Enter Budget Category Classification to which expenses will be charged.\n2- Current date.\n3+ Check the box to indicate if this request is for an advance of funds or for payment of an expense.\n| 4- Your Social Security Account Number.\n: §- The name of the person or company that should appear on the check.\n| 6- The substantive file number, or the file number of the case benefited by a payment to an informant, asset or\n| cooperative witness.
