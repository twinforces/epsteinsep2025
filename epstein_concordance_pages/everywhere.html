(PSR 4 32). The defendant and Epstein gave\nJane gifts, and Jane came to look up to the defendant like an older sister figure. (PSR 4] 32-33).\n\nThe defendant and Epstein abused that relationship of trust in the worst way imaginable.\nThey sexually abused Jane starting when she was just l4 years old, and the sexual abuse continued\nfor years. (PSR § 36). When Jane was still only l4 years old, the defendant and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where the defendant and Epstein fondled each other,\ncasually giggling about it, while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (PSR § 34). While this\nwas happening, “there were hands <span class=\"highlight\">everywhere</span>,” Epstein began to masturbate, and the defendant\nrubbed, kissed, and fondled Epstein. (/d.). After this initial sexual interaction, the defendant and\nEpstein continued to sexually abuse Jane. (PSR § 35). The defendant and Epstein taught Jane\nhou Epstein liked to be massaged and gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis. (/d.).\nJane was l4 years old, and the defendant tried to make Jane feel like this was “very normal” and\n“not a big deal.” (/d.). Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein between the ages of l4\nand l6 years old, and the defendant was frequently in the room when the abuse happened. (PSR\n36). Over time, the abuse escalated, and Epstein used vibrators on Jane, masturbated, put his\nfingers in Jane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face. U/d.). The defendant sometimes\ntouched Jane during these incidents; in particular, Jane recalled that the defendant touched her\nbreasts. (/d.). The sexual abuse was not limited to Palm Beach, Florida, as Jane traveled with the\ndefendant and Epstein to Epstein’s tounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New Mexico.\n(PSR § 37). Jane was sexually abused during those trips. (/d.).\n\n2.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life.

The\nguesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made. I\nMade contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth o4-o7-l953, Fl DL\nRn, and informed him of the search warrant for the\npremises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence\nand announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and\nmembers exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr\nParkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior\ndecorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of\n5l5 W 2oth Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for\nMr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2oo5 to\ndo’a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone\nwith Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr.\nEpstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised,\nhis contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never\nwitnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or\nNada. :\nI then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 3l5 Fast l4th Street in New York.\nMr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised\nhe personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr.\nEpstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein's\nassistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with\nEpstein <span class=\"highlight\">everywhere</span> he goes.\nI interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey.\nBailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and: has worked with Zeff\nfor only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not\nseen him. The interview was then concluded.\nI then spoke with Douglas Schoetle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York\nCity. Schoetle stated he has been Epstein's Architect for seven\nyears. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and\nspeaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoetle stated he mainly speaks\nwith Sara Kellen, Epstein s main assistant, who travels with Epstein.\nSchoetle stated he only has contact with Epstein when his services\nare needed.\nAt approximately lo:3o am, I was informed that the videotaping was\nconcluded. I entered the residence and located two covert (hidden)\ncameras. The first camera was a covert wall clock in the garage area.\nI traced the wire behind the clock and removed the RCA wire and\nunplugged the camera. The other covert camera was located within a\ndesk clock beside Epstein's desk. I traced the wire behind the clock\nand unplugged the RCA wire. I could not locate another camera.
