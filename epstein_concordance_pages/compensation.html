Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000356.jpg": "ate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 83\nime: l5:ol:37 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nise No, . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\n\nlo, 2oo6, at approximately 2:3o p.m., I served@llat her residence in\n\notiguipan The subpoena was given to her mother, Qi\n\nI learned through one of the victims Qj that she was personally\n\ncontacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein.\n\nThe source assured@™$she would receive monetary <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> for her\n\nassistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. @jfalso stated\n\nshe was told, \"Those who help him will be compensated and those who\n\nhurt him will be dealt with.” I told @lligthat tampering with a\n\nwitness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious.

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000770.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 ~ Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of5\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. /d. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater.

But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997.

To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 348\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated Relevance, Other Than Potential\n\nImpeachment.\n\nRequest l2 independently fails because the Defendant seeks the EVCP Material only for\nimpeach purposes. The Defendant argues that the EVCP Material is not “mere impeachment\nmaterial” because it is also “Brady material.” Resp. Ltr. at l3. This argument does not make this\nRequest proper under Rule l7. First, the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP Material is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004015.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page l5ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nApril 5, 2o2l\nPage l5 of l7\nexculpatory. Although BSF does not have the benefit of the ex parte submission that the Defendant\ncites, she appears to contend that the EVCP Material will contradict the Government’s theory as\nto the Defendant’s motive for commiting the crimes of which she has been indicted: procuring\nunderage girls for Epstein. Resp. Ltr. at l3. But the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP\nMaterial—consisting of claims submited by victims to an independent claims administration\nprogram, materials supporting those claims (such as medical and therapy records), and\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determinations for those claims—could possibly contradict the Government’s\ntheory that she commited crimes with the motive of procuring young girls for Epstein.’\n\nSecond, deeming the EVCP Material “Brady materials” does not render the Request\nappropriate under Rule l7, even if such a characterization were correct. Although the Government\nhas a constitutional duty to produce Brady materials, BSF has no such obligation. Thus, even if\nthe Requests in the Subpoena, including the Request for EVCP Material, might encompass some\nBrady materials, the Subpoena must still satisfy the Nixon requirements. See, e.g., Mendinueta-\nIbarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d at 5l3 (rejecting the defendant’s argument that under Rule l7 “the\nstringent requirements of Nixon do not apply when a defendant needs the requested information\nfor a fair trial, especially if that material is required to be turned over under Brady or Giglio”’);\nUnited States v. Jackson, No. o2 CR. 756 (LMM), 2oo6 WL l99325l, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l4,\n2oo6) (explaining “that the materials may contain Giglio material does not mean that they can be\nsubpoenaed under Rule l7” and quashing subpoena for failing Nixon’s admissibility requirement);\nUnited States v. Scaduto, No. 94 CR. 3ll (WK), l995 WL l3o5ll, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, l995)\n7 Again, if the Court is inclined to grant the Defendant’s motion as to Request l2, BSF\nrequests access to the Defendant’s ex parte submission so it can more fully and fairly respond to\nthe Defendant’s theory of relevance.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l  Page6of9\njury subpoena at issue in Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that\nproduction suggests coordination between the Government and BSF. Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them. This Court knous well that the Government has not always lived up to those\nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good\nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum,\nnone of Maxwell’s theories justify production of these documents under the Rule l7(c) process.\n\nRequest l2, which seeks “‘any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span>\nProgram made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks\n“any” submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell\noffered to narrou this request to just those materials submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action.\n\nThe request’s failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of\nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this\nrequest, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submited to the EVCP.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 79 of 349\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her.

The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9o of 349\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 242 of 349\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter.

(/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. Cosby admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—Cosby provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand Cosby’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against Cosby troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A.

As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena.

There is no plausible claim that inspection of the original photographs is\nwarranted, and to the extent that Maxwell seeks the photographs in order to disprove their\nauthenticity (and challenge any potential testimony that might be advanced at trial), the request is\nentirely speculative. Even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish relevance, the\nargument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s testimony or\nwhether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nFinally, the request for materials related to the Epstein Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund is\ndenied for substantially the same reasons the Court articulated in its April 27, 2o2l Opinion. See\nDkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 6-8. Here, too, Maxwell has failed to establish the\nmaterials’ relevance. The briefing makes clear that Maxwell seeks these documents for mere\nimpeachment purposes, which again does not warrant issuance or enforcement of a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena. Furthermore, to the extent that Maxwell hinges her theory of relevance on the\npossibility that these documents may contain some exculpatory evidence, the request is entirely\nspeculative. The “mere hope” that documents might produce some degree of exculpatory\nevidence is also insufficient. See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-579 (SWK), l984 WL 845,\nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell has proffered no plausible basis why these materials\nmight be exculpatory beyond her theory that they will help her undermine the potential witness’s\ncredibility.\n\nIn sum, for the reasons stated by the Court in its April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l orders,\nthe request for authorization of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-l is DENIED.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page /7 oflo\nRe =3N°w BE claims she was abused by Epstein and Maxwell,\n2l es Sec Indictment { 7(o):\nes\nES.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 54 of 6o\nIl. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Eligibility Criteria\nThe persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused\nby Epstein. In addition, the follouing criteria apply:\n\ne Theclaim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein.\n\ne An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may\nparticipate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met.\n\ne An individual who previously entered into a setlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual\nabuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are\nmet.\n\ne An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may\nparticipate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual\nacted under duress as a result of her oun sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other\neligibility criteria are met.\n\ne  |f the Claimant chooses to accept the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, the Claimant must dismiss with\nprejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities\nand/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or\nprior to the signed acceptance of the <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determination offer leter and executed\nRelease in order to receive payment.\n\nB. Legal Representatives of Claimants\nAn individual may file a claim on a victim’s behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority\nto act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The “Legal Representative” of an\nindividual Claimant shall mean: (l) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal\nguardian authorized by law to serve as the minor’s legal representative; (2) in the case of an\nincompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant’s\nlegal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person\nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's estate by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an atorney authorized to\nrepresent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program.\nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such\nproof may include a pouer of atorney; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as\nguardian or guardian ad litem; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as personal\nrepresentative of the Claimant’s estate (such as leters of administration); a copy of a retainer\n3|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 55 of 6o\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nil.

Individuals who have filed\na lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to\nbe eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals\nmust, houever, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at\nthe time of acceptance of a <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determination offer in order to receive payment.\n\nIndividuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\nnot otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before\nthe Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at\nwww.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire seting forth their\nname, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested\ninformation. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the\nindividual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is\neligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant\nProgram information.\n\nNote: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates\nthat the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It\ndoes not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has\nbeen submited and evaluated by the Administrator.\n\nRegistrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the\nEstate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their atorney to the\nAdministrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective\nDate through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline (“Registration Deadline”).

Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-4 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l6 of 22\nIl.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page lo of l6\ntl. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS\nA. Eligibility Criteria\nThe persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused\nby Epstein. In addition, the follouing criteria apply:\n\ne The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein.\n\ne An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may\nparticipate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met.\n\ne An individual who previously entered into a setlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual\nabuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are\nmet.\n\ne An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may\nparticipate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual\nacted under duress as a result of her oun sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other\neligibility criteria are met.\n\ne lf the Claimant chooses to accept the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, the Claimant must dismiss with\nprejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities\nand/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or\nprior to the signed acceptance of the <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determination offer leter and executed\nRelease in order to receive payment.\n\nB. Legal Representatives of Claimants\nAn individual may file a claim on a victim’s behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority\nto act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The “Legal Representative” of an\nindividual Claimant shall mean: (l) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal\nguardian authorized by law to serve as the minor’s legal representative; (2) in the case of an\nincompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant’s\nlegal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person\nwho has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant’s estate by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an atorney authorized to\nrepresent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program.\nLegal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such\nproof may include a pouer of atorney; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as\nguardian or guardian ad litem; documentation shouing the individual’s appointment as personal\nrepresentative of the Claimant’s estate (such as leters of administration); a copy of a retainer\n3|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page ll of l6\nagreement shouing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the atorney or a signed\nstatement by an adult Claimant and the atorney that a licensed/admited atorney is acting on her\nbehalf.\n\nill.

Individuals who have filed\na lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to\nbe eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals\nmust, houever, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at\nthe time of acceptance of a <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determination offer in order to receive payment.\n\nIndividuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\nnot otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before\nthe Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at\nwww.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire seting forth their\nname, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested\ninformation. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the\nindividual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is\neligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant\nProgram information.\n\nNote: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates\nthat the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It\ndoes not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has\nbeen submited and evaluated by the Administrator.\n\nRegistrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the\nEstate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their atorney to the\nAdministrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective\nDate through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline (“Registration Deadline”).

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter motion to quash the defendant’s Rule\nl7(c)(3) subpoena to Jordana Feldman, the administrator of the Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span>\nProgram (EVCP). For the reasons set forth belou, the subpoena should be quashed. !\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nAs the defendant acknouledges, she bears the burden of satisfying the standard in United\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683 (l974). (Def. Mot. at l). Pursuant to that standard, the “party\nseeking issuance of [a Rule l7(c)] subpoena must clear three hurdles: (l) relevancy; (2)\nadmissibility; (3) specificity.” United States v. Cole, 2o2l WL 9l2425, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. lo,\n2o2l) (internal quotation marks omited). The proponent must also establish that the records\nsought “are not otherwise procurable.” /d. (quoting Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo).\n\n' For sake of simplicity, the Government uses the term “Minor Victims” to include Witness-3. The\nGovernment acknouledges the Court’s order that Witness-3 should not be referenced at trial as a\nvictim.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\namounts—which the defendant cites in her motion. (Def. Mot. at 5). Thus, if these records are\nrelevant at all, they are “otherwise procurable.” Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2.4\n\nThe defendant also argues that the subpoenaed records contain prior statements of the\nMinor Victims, presumably suggesting that they may be admissible as prior inconsistent\nstatements. (Def. Mot. at 4). This argument misses the mark. Any statements in the EVCP’s files\nare unlikely to be inconsistent in light of the context in which they were made. See United States\nv. Barrou, 4oo F.3d lo9, l23 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (citing United States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 875\n(2d Cir. l995) for the proposition that an omission in a prior statement “should have been admited\nas an inconsistent statement because it would have been natural for the witness to include the fact”\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omited)). In order to initiate a proceeding with the\nEpstein Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund, a victim must articulate a claim “directed against Epstein.”\n(Indep. Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program Protocol, Def. Mot. Ex. l Atachment A Ex. | at\n3 (emphasis added)). And in that context, it would be wholly unsurprising if victims spoke at\ntimes about their experience with Epstein without discussing the defendant.° Further, if it were\ntrue (as the defendant argues above) that EVCP funds will reveal the Minor Victims’ bias because\ntheir recovery from the EVCP was aided by the Government’s continued case against the\ndefendant, one would expect that any statements by the Minor Victims to the EVCP regarding the\ndefendant would be consistent with their statements to the Government and at trial. If the Minor\n* Indeed, because all four Minor Victims identified in the subpoena have resolved their claims with\nthe EVCP, there is no reason to think their trial testimony will be biased in order to advance their\nclaims in a nou-completed setlement process.\n> Consider, for instance, if a victim met Epstein and the defendant together on a certain date. It\nwould be entirely consistent for the victim to testify as much on the stand, and to tell the EVCP\nthat she “met Epstein”—without mentioning the defendant—on that date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page6of8\nPage 6\nVictims’ submissions to the EVCP did not discuss the defendant, a criminal case against the\ndefendant would not advance their claims.\n\nSecond, even if these subpoenas yielded marginally relevant impeachment material or\nmarginally inconsistent statements notwithstanding their context, such evidence would not be\nadmissible under Rule 4o3. At the November l, 2o2l conference, the defendant sought to preclude\nthe Government from arguing that the Minor Victims’ setlements with the EVCP reflects an\nendorsement of their claims, which “would be confusing to the jury” and “open the door to an\nexplanation from the defense about what really happened in those proceedings,” a request to which\nthe Court and Government agreed. (ll/ol/2l Tr. at 43:7-46:3). It remains the Government’s\nposition that cross-examination highlighting the fact that the Minor Victims received large\nsetlements for their claims would not open the door to a broader discussion of the Epstein Victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program.\n\nIf, houever, the defendant engages in significant cross-examination about what Minor\nVictims did and did not say to the EVCP, and the reasons for those statements, it would create just\nthat confusion and open just that door. If the defendant argues that a Minor Victim should have,\nbut did not, make statements about the defendant to the EVCP, the Government will have to\nexplain to the jury the purpose of the EVCP and its adjudicative process in order to contextualize\nthat omission. Similarly, if the defendant argues that the Minor Victims’ testimony was biased by\nsome interrelationship between the EVCP and this case, the Government will have to explain to\nthe jury the absence of such an interrelationship, including the timeline of the Minor Victims’\nstatements relative to the timeline of the EVCP. Indeed, it appears that the defendant anticipates\narguing that some Minor Victims’ bias is shoun by the fact that their counsel was involved in\nstructuring the EVCP, which would require further response from the Government about the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\noperations of the EVCP. (Def. Mot. at 5 (“Lawyers for Accuser-2 and Witness-3 were instrumental\nin creating and structuring the terms of the Protocol.”)). The risk of confusing the issues and\nwasting time at trial substantially outweigh any probative value in the evidence the defendant\nmight obtain.\n\nThis is not a trial about the scope and adjudicative process of the EVCP. All of this should\nbe precluded, and therefore none of it is admissible under Nixon. The defendant is able to make\narguments about bias and consistency without issuing a subpoena that is unlikely to yield relevant\ninformation—information that would be precluded at trial in any event.®\n\nD. Communications\n\nFinally, the subpoena calls for communications between EVCP and the Minor Victims and\ntheir counsel. The term “communications” is defined broadly, covering “all forms of\ncorrespondence, including regular mail, email, text messages, memorandum, or other writen\ncommunication of information of any kind.”\n\nThis subpoena request is a classic fishing expedition that the Court should quash. There is\nno reason to believe that the Minor Victim or their counsel would make substantive statements,\nwhich might be inconsistent, in emails and text messages. The defendant offers no reason why\ntheir theory of bias would find support in correspondence. Nor is one supported by logic: the\ntheory is that the Minor Victims told false stories to the Government to advance the prosecution,\nnot that they did or said biased things to the EVCP. This subpoena does not seek to “obtain\nidentified evidence” but rather to engage in “a general ‘fishing expedition’ that atempts to use the\n® The defendant defines “EVCP Material” to include information regarding <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> received\nby Minor Victims and releases signed by them. (Def. Mot. Ex. l Atachment A). Those items\nshould be treated identically to the specific requests for them, as discussed above.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page3ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember ll, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nThe government devotes only a single paragraph to explaining why Accuser-3’s evidence\nis admissible as direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five. See\nNovember 5 Ltr. at 6-7. The few reasons the government does give are meritless. The\ngovernment starts by asserting that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible to prove the sex trafficking\nconspiracy for the same reasons that it is admissible to prove the Mann Act conspiracies — reasons\nwhich the Court has already rejected. See id. at 6. The government then makes the puzzling\nassertion that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible because it “demonstrates the reasons for a co-\nconspirator’s participation in the conspiracy.” /d. Specifically, the government asserts that the\nevidence shous that (l) “minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were compensated,”\nwhich the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein “recruited and enticed girls\nto engage in commercial sex acts”; and (2) “Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age,\ntypically under the age of eighteen,” which the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell\nand Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors under the age of eighteen. Jd. at 6-7.\n\nThese arguments are misguided and unpersuasive. First, neither of the two specific bases\nfor admission speaks to “the reasons for” Ms. Maxwell’s alleged participation in the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy, as the government claims. Second, the two specific bases for admission\nare legally and factually flawed.\n\nAs to the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, Po\nLT\nLo\nLT\n2o498o8.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 496 Filed ll/22/2l Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT USDC SDNY ioe\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCUMENT\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: ll/22/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The government has alloued the testimony of the accusers to be corrupted by a group\nof civil lawyers who have collaborated, for years, in the pursuit of Mr. Epstein. These lawyers\nhave shared information among themselves and their joint clients, developing a “play book”\nabout what should be said to make a claim against Mr. Epstein or the Epstein Victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund. The accusers’ stories have changed dramatically over time and none of\nthese changes has been challenged by the government. Instead, the government either ignores the\nchanges or offers excuses to be adopted by the accusers as the reason for the change.\n\nMoreover, avenues of investigation helpful to Ms. Maxwell have been ignored by the\ngovernment. For example, the government has refused to obtain the accusers’ submissions to the\nEpstein Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund and even nou is resisting defense efforts to obtain the\ninformation. The government refused to obtain I. except for a few pages\ndescribing when she first met Epstein months before she claims to have met Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhen witnesses begin to say favorable things about Ms. Maxwell in interviews with the\ngovernment the interviews are abruptly terminated. When witnesses do not support the\ngovernment’s theory they are challenged or cautioned to retain counsel. Professor Gershman,\nwhose credentials and opinions the government does not challenge, has reliable and relevant\nopinions to offer on these issues, which do not contravene this Court’s rulings on the motions in\nlimine.\n\nFinally, there can be no objection to any of Professor Gershman’s opinions if the\ngovernment “puts the thoroughness of the investigation into issue. . . .” See TR ll/l/2o2l, p 29.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008139.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page l8 of 42\n\n46.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nDuring her cross-examination, Jane denied knouing that cooperating with the\ngovernment in the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell and testifying against her would help her civil\ncase against Ms. Maxwell and her claim for <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> from the Epstein Victims’\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (EVCP). Because Jane denied having this knouledge, Ms. Maxwell has\na constitutional right to call Jane’s atorney (Robert Glassman) as a witness and to ask him\nwhether he told Jane that cooperating and testifying against her would “help her case.” U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. This issue is relevant to Jane’s motive to cooperate and testify,’ and it’s\n\n' Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l6 (l974) (“A more particular atack on the witness’\ncredibility is effected by means of cross-examination directed touard revealing possible biases,\nprejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities\nin the case at hand. The partiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is always\nrelevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.” (quotation\nomited)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page6of8\nthere is no reason to think Jane expressly or implicitly authorized Glassman to waive her privilege\non the topic of Glassman’s advice to Jane about assisting the Government. Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the privilege — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived privilege. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the atorney-client communication,” placed “the atorney-client\nrelationship directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her cooperation with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the atorney-client relationship into the trial by atempting to use privileged\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a privilege waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s privilege, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout cooperation. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”). The defense has other avenues to suggest that cooperating with the\n3 For these reasons, the cases cited by the defense are inapposite. (Def. Leter at 3-4).

And insofar as the point is to\nimpeach Jane, this statement is of minimal impeachment value. Jane said no when asked whether\nshe knew that “cooperation with the government, including testifying, would benefit you in your\ncivil litigation against the Epstein estate and Ms. Maxwell.” l2/ol/2l Tr. at 58l; see id. (asking\nthe same question about her knouledge “at any point” regarding Jane’s civil litigation). As of\nAugust l7, 2o2l, the date of the statement from Glassman to the Government, Jane had been paid\nby the Epstein Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund, and her civil case had been dismissed. And Glassman\nappears to have advised Jane that the civil cases were fully resolved. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 6l9\n(testimony by Jane that she does not have a financial stake in the outcome of this trial).4 At most,\nthen, the statement means that Glassman, at some point in the past, advised Jane that testifying\nwould aid another “case.” And at most, that would impeach Jane by suggesting that, while she\naccurately testified that she did not “knou” that her “cooperation with the government, including\ntestifying,” would benefit her in her civil case or EVCP claim, she had been told that at one point\nin the past.\n\nBy contrast, there is significant risk that admission of the statement would require\nGlassman to divulge further privileged communications with Jane. Glassman’s comment to the\nGovernment is not easily intelligible. Glassman referenced “help[ing] her case,” which is not\nspecifically a reference to civil litigation or her claim with the EVCP, and says that “it,” whatever\nit is, would help that case. (Def. Leter Ex. A). To explain what Glassman is referencing, and\nwhen he gave that advice, he would likely have to provide more content to his advice to Jane and\n* The Government is of course not aware of Glassman’s privileged advice to Jane.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document544 Filed l2/l4/2l Page4of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

For each, the proposed testimony is either duplicative of facts already in\nevidence, is irrelevant or is improper impeachment. And in any event, whatever marginal\nprobative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion\nassociated with calling an atorney to testify against his client.\n\nA. Jack Scarola\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course\nof his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be privileged, it is\nirrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nMuch of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn\non cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the follouing facts:\n\ne Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2oo8 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program. (Tr. l6l7-l8).\n\ne Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2oo7 and March 2ol9, and then again\nwas out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2o2o. (Tr.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page4of9\n\nl68l-83).\n\ne Scarola was present for Carolyn’s the meetings the Government listed by the defense. (Tr.\n\nl684; Def. Leter at 3-4).\n\ne Carolyn received $2,8o4,ooo from the Epstein Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program, not\ncounting the $446,ooo she had previously received from her claims against Epstein and\n\nSarah Kellen (Tr. l688-89).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant has already obtained through Carolyn much of the testimony it\nanticipates from Scarola. There is no need for Scarola to testify to information already obtained\nfrom Carolyn, and it obviously does not impeach Carolyn for Scarola to confirm her answers.\n\nNearly all of additional testimony the defendant proposes to elicit from Scarola is irrelevant\nand non-impeaching. It does not mater that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Leter at\n2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to contact Carolyn\nprobative (id. at 3).' It says nothing about Carolyn that Scarola copied counsel for other victims\non an email. (id. at 2). None of that information impeaches Carolyn’s testimony in any way—\nrather, it is entirely consistent with her testimony.”\n\nThe defendant argues this testimony is relevant to “establish the timeline of Carolyn’s\ncooperation with the government and her motive and bias in testifying against Ms. Maxwell, in\nparticular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and uncooperative until there was the prospect\n' The Government would stipulate to the specific dates of meetings between Scarola, Carolyn, and\nthe Government. (See Def. Leter at 3-4).\n\n? The defendant would also elicit from Scarola that, during a 2o2o meeting, Scarola told the\nGovernment that he had shoun Carolyn a picture of the Epstein associate with the same name as\nJane, but Carolyn could not identify the person at the time. But the defendant did not ask Carolyn\nabout that person, so this testimony would not impeach Carolyn—to the extent it is not privileged.\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction.

The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs\n\nMs. Feldman’s declaration explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the\nEVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly difficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such\ndeeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had\non their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in\npositions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not\nfeel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply\nwould not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.\nFeldman by victims’ atorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to\nparticipate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of\nconfidentiality.”*?\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program. As Ms.\nFeldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very\nfoundation and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?\nCompelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be\n“anathema to the integrity of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its\nhead with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the\nEVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an\n9 See Ex.

This Court denied the request,\nfinding that Maxwell appeared to seek the materials for impeachment purposes, and that “the\nmere fact that certain documents might be impeachment evidence does not render them\n‘relevant’ for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those documents would become relevant only after\na witness testifies.”°* The Court also held that Maxwell “may renew her request for these\ndocuments once she identifies specific individuals whose submissions she seeks and spells out\nwith specificity the relevance of all requested materials.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page6of7\n\nl4. | Asamater of public policy, ensuring confidentiality in litigation-alternative\nvictim <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs like the EVCP is an absolute imperative. To compromise\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs as integral to\nprogram integrity. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent administrator has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs.\n\nl6.

Biros today announced that the Co-Executors\nof the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Estate”) have filed documents in the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nseeking expedited approval from the Court for the establishment of a voluntary claims resolution program that will\nallou eligible individuals the opportunity to resolve their sexual abuse claims against Mr. Epstein and his Estate\nthrough a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation.\nMs. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — distinguished, independent claims administration experts with\nextensive experience in fashioning similar claims programs — will lead the design of the program, including\ndeveloping criteria and requirements for the evaluation and determination of eligibility and <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, and the\naccompanying claims process. Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program\nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.\nFeldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from atorneys representing over 7o victims, the Atorney\nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be\nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the “Administrator’), the former Deputy Special Master of the\nSeptember llth Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the\nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of\ntheir September llth-related exposure.\n“This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of\npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknouledgment by an independent third party as to\nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.\n“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> is\ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the\nyears of pain these victims have endured.”\n“These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>,” said Mr.\nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> programs\nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the\nSeptember llth Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund, among others.\nThe Program provides victims with an atractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is\nspeedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts,\nDOJ-OGR-oooll475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-3 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of3\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior setlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary\nrequirements.\n\nImportant features of the Program include:\n\nl. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign.

Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of9\nil.

Individuals who have filed\na lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to\nbe eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program.

Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program.

General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5ofl7\nClaimant, as well as overall Program operations and administration. The\nEstate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nDecisions of the Administrator are not subject to review or modification in any\nway by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n\n4. Hou much money from Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate is available to the Program?\nThere is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> to be\nmade to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated\nseparately by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her\nsole and exclusive discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>.\n\n5. When did the Program become effective?\n\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2o2o (“Effective Date”). The\nAdministrator has reached out to previously identified victims and will\nprovide other individuals with an opportunity to participate in the Program\nthrough an online registration process, described in Section III belou.\n\nIl. Eligibility Requirements\n\nl. Who is eligible to participate in the Program?\n\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein, regardless of where they were harmed, when they were harmed,\nwhether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nwhether they have previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein\nand/or the Estate.\n\n2. If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am\neligible to receive <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the Administrator has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>. That eligibility determination is\nmade only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation,\nand after that information is evaluated by the Administrator. For more\ninformation, please see Section III.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 6ofl7\n\n3. Do I have to stay pending litigation or dismiss my lawsuit in order to\nparticipate in the Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program?\n\nNo. If you have filed litigation against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of\nJeffrey Epstein and/or related individuals and entities, you do not need to\nstay the litigation or make any other concession in a pending litigation in\norder to participate in the Program. Litigation may continue during the\nprocessing of your claim in the Program. Likewise, if you have not yet filed a\nlawsuit, you remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently\nwith participation in the Program. You will, houever, need to provide the\nProgram with information about the litigation, including the case number,\nvenue and date where the case was filed.\n\nIf the Administrator determines that you are eligible to receive <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>,\nand issues you a <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> determination leter, you will have the\nfreedom to determine whether to accept the offered <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>.

Ipreviously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein and/or the\nEstate. Can I participate in the Program? Do I have to submit a copy of the\nsetlement agreement to the Program? (Added July 28, 2o2o)\n\nClaimants who previously entered into a setlement agreement with Epstein\n\nand/or his Estate are not precluded from participating in the Program. The\n\nAdministrator will, houever, consider the prior setlement in evaluating the claim,\n\nas set forth in the Protocol. In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review\n\na copy of the setlement agreement. The Administrator recognizes impacted\n\nClaimants’ concerns that providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those\n\nconcerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant’s setlement\n\nagreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the\n\nClaimant’s behalf, consents in writing to the Estate’s production of the agreement\n\nto the Program for purposes of the Administrator’s evaluation of the claim. The\n\nEstate has also agreed that it will waive any objection to, and will not asserta claim\n\nbecause of, a Claimant providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram for purposes of the Administrator's evaluation of the claim.\n\nIII.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-7 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel QeHIBIT G\nIN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS\nDIVISION OF ST.

The defense seems to suggest that\n2 this imolantation happened from the media, greedy civil\n\n3 lawyers, and the FBI. None of those actually make sense and\n\n4 not one has support in this record.\n\n5 Starting with the media, you heard absolutely nothing\n6 at this trial about any of these witnesses consuming media in\n\n7 this case.

There is not a shred of\n\nl5 evidence that a group of lawyers got together, made up a story\nl6 about Maxwell, and then imolanted it into these witnesses'\n\nl7 minds. Remember, each witness had a different lawyer. So for\nl8 this theory to work, four different atorneys had to come up\n\nl9 with this story and they separately manipulate their clients\n2o into perjuring themselves at a federal trial all so they could\n2l get a cut of the Epstein Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund. That makes\n22 no sense for a bunch of different reasons.\n23 For one thing, Annie told you that her lawyer is pro\n24 bono, working for free.

And it makes no sense for the other\n2 lawyers to push this supposedly made up story about the\n\n3 defendant when they've already goten paid. Remember, the\n\n4 payments have all been made, the lawyers got their money long\n\n5 before this trial started.\n\n6 And you knou these lawyers didn't just implant the\n\n7 defendant into these victims' minds. Jane, Carolyn, and Annie\n8 all talked about Maxwell, remembered her as part of their\n\n9 experiences a long, long time ago. They all included her in\n\nlo their accounts before there was some supposed incentive for a\nll payday. Annie mentioned it to Dave Mulligan, her high school\nl2 boyfriend, and the FBI in 2oo6. She told both of them hou\n\nl3 Maxwell touched her breasts during a massage. Jane told Mat,\nl4 her boyfriend from a decade ago, about the woman who would make\nl5 her feel comfortable in the room. Carolyn mentioned meeting\n\nl6 the woman with short black hair and an accent to the FBI in\n\nl7 2oo7. She mentioned Maxwell twice in her deposition, and she\nl8 told Sean that she saw Maxwell at the house at that time, way\nl9 before there was a <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> fund or any incentive to add in\n2o Maxwell if it wasn't true.\n2l And that timing is crucial here because it completely\n22 guts the whole defense theory. The defense suggests that some\n23 lawyers made everything up about Maxwell to get money, but even\n24 if adding Maxwell in to get money could get you money, which is\n25 not true, there is no universe in which that was the case when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l79 of 257 3ol3\nLCKVMAX8 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl Maxwell was exactly who Alessi said she was.

I'd encourage you to take a\nl2 look at it. Look at the whole stipulation. You'll see it\nl3 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial.

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\n<span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l2 of 27\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v.

The defense seems to suggest that\n2 this imolantation happened from the media, greedy civil\n\n3 lawyers, and the FBI. None of those actually make sense and\n\n4 not one has support in this record.\n\n5 Starting with the media, you heard absolutely nothing\n6 at this trial about any of these witnesses consuming media in\n\n7 this case.

There is not a shred of\n\nl5 evidence that a group of lawyers got together, made up a story\nl6 about Maxwell, and then imolanted it into these witnesses'\n\nl7 minds. Remember, each witness had a different lawyer. So for\nl8 this theory to work, four different atorneys had to come up\n\nl9 with this story and they separately manipulate their clients\n2o into perjuring themselves at a federal trial all so they could\n2l get a cut of the Epstein Victim <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Fund. That makes\n22 no sense for a bunch of different reasons.\n23 For one thing, Annie told you that her lawyer is pro\n24 bono, working for free.

And it makes no sense for the other\n2 lawyers to push this supposedly made up story about the\n\n3 defendant when they've already goten paid. Remember, the\n\n4 payments have all been made, the lawyers got their money long\n\n5 before this trial started.\n\n6 And you knou these lawyers didn't just implant the\n\n7 defendant into these victims' minds. Jane, Carolyn, and Annie\n8 all talked about Maxwell, remembered her as part of their\n\n9 experiences a long, long time ago. They all included her in\n\nlo their accounts before there was some supposed incentive for a\nll payday. Annie mentioned it to Dave Mulligan, her high school\nl2 boyfriend, and the FBI in 2oo6. She told both of them hou\n\nl3 Maxwell touched her breasts during a massage. Jane told Mat,\nl4 her boyfriend from a decade ago, about the woman who would make\nl5 her feel comfortable in the room. Carolyn mentioned meeting\n\nl6 the woman with short black hair and an accent to the FBI in\n\nl7 2oo7. She mentioned Maxwell twice in her deposition, and she\nl8 told Sean that she saw Maxwell at the house at that time, way\nl9 before there was a <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span> fund or any incentive to add in\n2o Maxwell if it wasn't true.\n2l And that timing is crucial here because it completely\n22 guts the whole defense theory. The defense suggests that some\n23 lawyers made everything up about Maxwell to get money, but even\n24 if adding Maxwell in to get money could get you money, which is\n25 not true, there is no universe in which that was the case when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017200.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l79 of 257 3ol3\nLCKVMAX8 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl Maxwell was exactly who Alessi said she was.

Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial.

The claims resolution program is therefore not a\nvalid basis to stay this action without Plaintiffs consent.”\n\nThird, Maxwell contends that her motion to dismiss is “strong and warrants a stay of\ndiscovery pending its resolution.” Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion\nto dismiss in her response to Maxwell’s leter requesting a pre-motion conference on that motion.\nECF No. 48. Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher discovery obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay. Fact discovery in this mater ends in less than two months, and we\nrespectfully submit that her delay tactics should end nou.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ David Boies\n\nDavid Boies, Esq.\ncc: Counsel of Record (via ECF)\n2 Maxwell also argues that the fact that Plaintiffs sister (and a few other victims) have\nvoluntarily stayed their cases in light of a potential claims resolution program warrants a ruling\nthat Plaintiff must stay her case as well. This makes no sense. Plaintiff and her sister filed separate\nactions and are separate litigants. Plaintiffs sister’s decisions do not bind Plaintiff, nor do any\nother victims’ decisions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019446.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl Hage4Payjeds of l3\n2o2o, Maxwell filed the leter motion that is nou before this Court, requesting a stay of this\naction until the conclusion of her pending criminal case. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.) In her\nmotion, Maxwell set out the factors relevant to a stay analysis, and argued that not only her oun\ninterest, but also the interests of the courts, the public, and the other parties would be best served\nby the requested stay. (See generally id.)\n\nOn August 27, 2o2o, the Co-Executors submited a leter consenting to the entry of a stay\nand joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding. (See Leter to the\nCourt from Bennet J. Moskouitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.”)\n\n(Dkt. 77).) The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)\n\nBy leter dated August 27, 2o2o, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing\nthat the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief. (See generally Leter to the\nCourt from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)\nIn her opposition, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s detention should pose no real\nimpediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a\nstay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to\ngain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019447.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODocemek Go, FICE DLl Hadge4Bayeds of l3\nhaving to divulge anything about herself or the bad conduct she is alleged to have commited.”\n(/d., at l; see also id., at 4-5 (arguing that Maxwell had already demonstrated her ability to\nparticipate actively in this action from jail).) Plaintiff also noted that, under the terms of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program, she is not required to agree to a stay of her lawsuit in order to participate\nin that program. (/d., at 2.) As for the prejudice that Plaintiff would purportedly suffer from a\nstay of these proceedings, Plaintiff asserted that, “[flor too long[,] Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell skirted the consequences of their vile acts,” and that she should not have to\nwait “even longer for justice.” (/d., at 4.)\n\nMaxwell filed a reply on September 4, 2o2o (see Leter to the Court from Laura A.\nMenninger, Esq., dated Sept. 4, 2o2o (“9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr.) (Dkt. 79)), contending\nthat Plaintiff had not adequately demonstrated hou the requested stay would harm her interests,\nand taking issue with Plaintiff's assertions that Maxwell could reasonably litigate this case from\nthe MDC (see id.).\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, this Court additionally received a leter from Acting United States\nAtorney Audrey Strauss, on behalf of the Government, requesting leave to intervene in this\nmater for the limited purpose of — like Maxwell — seeking a stay of this case, in its entirety,\npending the resolution of the Government’s criminal prosecution against Maxwell.

In its leter, the Government urged this Court to stay this action on the grounds that\n“a complete stay of this civil action [would] serve the public interest of preserving the integrity\nof the criminal prosecution against Maxwell and [would] conserve private, public, and judicial\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019452.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl ade Bayeds of l3\n\nHere, Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury on June 29, 2o2o; she has been detained\npending her criminal trial; and her trial date has been set. (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 2.) Should\ndiscovery in the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend\nherself by making pretrial disclosures and giving deposition testimony (which could be used\nagainst her in the criminal case) or to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination (which would protect her in the criminal case, but which could well result in an\nadverse inference being drawn against her in the civil case). (See id., at 4; see also Louis Vuiton\nMalletier, 676 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment privilege that may\nbe posed by parallel proceedings).) This legitimate concern, made more real and immediate by\nthe active posture of criminal case, militates in favor of a stay.\n\n3. The Interests of the Plaintiff\n\nPlaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding would harm her interests because, as she is\nsuffering “ongoing damaging effects” from the alleged abuse, and she should not have to wait\nany longer to hold Defendants accountable. (8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 4.) While, as a general\nmater, plaintiffs have a strong interest in the expeditious resolution of their civil claims, see\nVolmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 4o, Plaintiff here has not advanced any particularized reason\nwhy a delay would cause her prejudice, such as a likely loss of physical evidence or witness\ntestimony during the period of a stay. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at l (noting that “there is\nlitle chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this\ncase”); see also id., at 4.)\n\nAdditionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to\nagree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (and, in fact,\nrecognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020453.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page6/ of 9l\nDENIED.

Further, upon execution of this\nagreement and a plea agreement with the State Atorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held\nin abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement.

It did so to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular\nnon-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes.\nIn its zeal to pin the blame for its oun incompetence and for Epstein’s crimes on\nMaxwell, the Government breached its promise not to prosecute Maxwell, charged\nher with time-barred offenses, resurrected and recast decades-old allegations for\nconduct previously ascribed to Epstein and other named assistants, and joined\nforces with complainants’ civil atorneys, whose interests were financial, to\ndevelop new allegations that would support charges against Maxwell.\n\nImmediately after Epstein’s death, complainants’ civil atorneys representing\nEpstein victims, including those who testified at trial, began to assist in the creation\nof the Epstein Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Compensation</span> Program (VCP), a non-adversarial and\nconfidential claims resolution program set up to compensate self-identified victims\nof Epstein, even as they were actively involved in the Government’s investigation.\nOn June 25, 2o2o, the Program began accepting claims.

When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement.

SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021316.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel44 of 258\nSA-l42\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\n\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.)

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no <span class=\"highlight\">compensation</span>, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o38, Page243 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.
