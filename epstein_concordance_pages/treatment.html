Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v.

See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F.

It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v.

Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000382.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl4_ Filed o7/l5/l9 Page l7 of l8\n\nJSR,\n\nZz) SNART SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT\nam na, Monitor ASSESSMENT ano PLANNING INITIATIVE\n\nNES, TR I = Office of Sex Offender Sentencing.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change.

For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of recreation\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive recreation time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits. While the leter accurately states that one video teleconference (VTC) was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 8 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 45\n(Nathan, J.)

The human rights objections that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face\nextradition to the US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n\n35. Finally, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to demonstrate that her extradition would\nbe incompatible with her rights under the ECHR**. The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The decision in Love was based on section 9l of the 2oo3\nAct, and the court made no finding under Article 3 (para l23). In Hafeez, which was decided in January 2o2o, the High\nCourt received the same evidence as has been before the court in Zove, and concluded that “the evidence in this case falls\nwell short of the necessary threshold” to prove a breach of Article 3 based on the conditions at MDC and MCC (see\nHafeez v Government of the United States of America [2o2o] EWHC l55 (Admin), para. 66).\nl922623.l\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 29\nspecific concerns, such as access to medical care”’. In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l4 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nPart II — The likely outcome of an extradition request from the United States of\nAmerica to France in the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell\n\n33. In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically motivated.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the\nright to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane\n\n5 Cass. Crim., 26 March 2ol9, nNo. l9-8l73l.\nl6 Einhorn v.

If the Investigating Chamber\nfinds that the requested person would face a risk of being subject to violations of their\nArticle 3 rights, or that there is a risk of a “flagrant denial of justice” in the requesting\nState, it must deliver a negative opinion to the extradition request.\n\n37. In the recent years, human rights bars to an extradition request made by the United States\nof America are only the subject to in-depth scrutiny by French courts when the requested\nperson faces the imposition of the death penalty'® or the imposition of a life\nimprisonment sentence without the possibility of parole in the USA. We understand that\nthis is not the case here. It can be underlined that, when needed, the USA can commit\nnot to impose such a sentence and that such a commitment suffices to allou extradition.\n\n38. As long as the French government receives necessary assurances related to human rights\nwhen requested, such an argument would be very likely to be rejected in this case.\n\n(i) Dual criminality\n\n39. A further possible bar to extradition is the dual criminality rule, which requires the\nconduct in respect of which extradition is sought to constitute a criminal offense in the\nlaw of both requested and requesting States.\n\n4o. Article 2.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France expressly states that\n“fa]cts shall be extraditable if they are punished under the laws in both States by\ndeprivation of liberty for a maximum of at least one year or by a more severe penalty. If\nextradition is requested for purposes of enforcing a judgment, the time remaining to be\nserved must be at least six months.”\n\n4l. There is no doubt that the conduct referred to in the Grand Jury charges against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, contained in the Superseding Indictment Sl 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), filed\non July 8\", 2o2o, also constitutes criminal conduct under French law, as the crime of\n“proxenetisme’’.\n\n42.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 38\n\nA.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page l6ofl8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\n\nl7.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shous that the loss of French\nnationality prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are\nintended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.\n\n? htps://www.lemonde. fr/societe/article/2ol8/o7/l 6/incertitude-sur-le-sort-de-l-islamiste-djamel-beghal-qui-sort-\nde-prison-lundi_5332o53_ 3224. html\n> ECtHR 3 December 2oo9, Daoudi v.

Here,\nconsistent with the SDNY Grand Jury Plan, the venire for the grand jury that indicted the defendant\nwas drawn from the voter lists of the follouing counties: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan, and Dutchess. That is undoubtedly a “properly designated division” pursuant to the\nJSSA. As noted, the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ ll2(b). For purposes of the JSSA, district courts in such undivided districts have the authority\nto determine “divisions” comprised of “counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions\nsurrounding the places where court is held.” 28 U.S.C. § l869(e). Accordingly, while the SDNY\nJury Plan neither creates nor ever uses the term “White Plains Division” or “Manhatan Division,”\nit contemplates Master Jury Wheels drawn from two geographic areas that satisfy the definition of\n“division” under the JSSA.

Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”*® in licu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp://www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ceforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential <span class=\"highlight\">Treatment</span> or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH.

The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°* The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\noe? The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal\nSystem to the USAO on January lo, 2o2o.\n32o See In re Wild, No. l9-l3843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)) (Sept. 3o, 2ol9).\nos Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime\nVictims Rights Act at l4 (Oct. 3l, 2ol9). As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*”°\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\nS28 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\n394 Inre Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 274 of 348\nB.

OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “‘misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2l, 2ol9).\n\n255\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3462\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25 of 3o\n\nBLDS, LLC\n\nr rd\n\nr r\nl6o8 Walnut Street\nSuite llo8\nPhiladelphia, PA l9lo3 USA\nMain: 2l5.7l7.232o\nFax: 2l5.7l7.2324\nEmail: statgroup@bldsllc.com\nSUMMARY\nBernard Siskin received his B.S. degree in Mathematics from the University of Pitsburgh and a\nPh.D. in Statistics from the University of Pennsylvania.

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page lo of l4\n\nJane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation is also directly relevant to the discovery\ndisputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections\nto the documents that Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 are atempting to obtain. The current\nvictims have responded by explaining hou these documents are relevant, including explaining\nhou these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his pouerful political and\nsocial connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s\nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to\nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knouledge. See, e.g.,\n\nDE 266 at 6-lo. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of\nthese requests, as well as the need for those requests.\n\nOne clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding\nEpstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea\narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince\nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz. Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,\n\ne.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at l6-l8). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knouledge of\nEpstein’s connection with some of these pouerful! people and thus hou Epstein might have used\nthem to secure favorable <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>.\n\nAdding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control’”*® in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp:/(www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ccforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential <span class=\"highlight\">Treatment</span> or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate.

Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°?

The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2l, 2ol9).\n\n255\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004758.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page l5 of 32 ll\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl I'm a firm believer that any society should be judged and can\n\n2 be, I guess, rated by hou they treat its poorest citizens and\n\n3 by hou it treats those that are incarcerated.\n\n4 MCC is not a good, for lack of a beter word, a good\n\niy look for America.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo563l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagellof 24\nsexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography’). To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v. Schneider, No. CRIM.A. lo-29, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (E.D. Pa.\n* Abrogated on other grounds by Casey v. Merck & Co., 653 F.3d 95, loo (2d Cir. 2oll).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 24\n“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain hou these conclusions were\nreached, what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her conclusions can be\nverified.\n\nThis is exactly why the Court in United States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

But she has no experience treating or evaluating alleged perpetrators of sexual\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 24\nB. Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape.

It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including disclosure of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed disclosure.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 43\nJournal of Child Sexual Abuse, 23:957-976, 2ol4\nCopyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2 et ee\nISSN; lo53-87l2 print/l547-o679 online\nDOI: lo.lo8o/lo5387l2.2ol4.96o632\nThe Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual\nAbuse: Conceptual and Measurement Issues\nNATALIE BENNETT and WILLIAM O’DONOHUE\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, Reno, Nevada, USA\n\nThere bave been claims that some child molesters engage in a\n\n“seduction stage” prior to commiting abuse. These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Issues\nof poor definition, the adoption of the term “grooming” and the prevalence of sexual grooming will be\ndiscussed. Consideration will be given to hou prominent theories of child sexual abuse often neglect\nsexual grooming. This will be folloued by a detailed account of the existing knouledge within the\nliterature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition\nof sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the\nsexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming ls required to facilitate\na preventative approach to child protection.\nKeywords Sexual grooming; theory of child sexual abuse\nIntroduction\nThe complex nature of the tactics used by child sex offenders in their efforts to sexually abuse\nchildren is increasingly evident in the accounts of the people affected by this predatory\nbehaviour. Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\nqualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “qualified expert” in something, she is not a “qualified\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial relationship with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6. If this were right, though, one would\nexpect the government to explain hou clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the\ntruth — in other words, hou clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5978\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of 52\n\nBut that’s not what the government does. Instead, right after claiming that “[c]linical\npsychologists are not so credulous,” the government essentially says to Ms. Maxwell, “Hou dare\nyou?” In the government’s words, “The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim\nthat Dr. Rocchio has been misled by hundreds of patients who sought professional <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for\ntraumatic events that did not occur.” Resp. at l6.\n\nIn this way, and in one breath, the government atests that Rocchio is “not so credulous.”\nBut in the next breath, the government asks this Court to assume that Rocchio “has [not] been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for traumatic events that did\nnot occur.” In other words, the government asks this Court to assume Rocchio’s patients are\ntelling the truth, just as Rocchio does. Apparently Rocchio is “so credulous.” But there is no\nreason this Court should be.\n\nThe government next notes that the term “grooming-by-proxy” “appears nouhere in the\nGovernment’s expert notice.” Resp. at 26. That’s hardly surprising, though, because there is no\nreliable way to assess or analyze if one individual “grooming” a minor to facilitate abuse by\nsomeone else, even though that is exactly what the government says Ms. Maxwell did.\n\nAs detailed today is Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 4l2 motion, the Indictment alleges “grooming”\nor “normalization” of sexual behavior by Ms. Maxwell over a dozen times. The government does\nnot, houever, contend that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” anyone for her oun benefit; instead, the\ngovernment contends that she “groomed” them for Epstein’s benefit. But as the government does\nnot dispute, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study, nothing—to validate\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy (even if she doesn’t use that phrase).°\n\n° The articles and cases the government cites involve alleged grooming behavior by the preparator\nof the abuse, not alleged grooming behavior by a third party.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5979\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim.

At that time, Atorney General William Barr said he initially had his oun suspicions\nabout Epstein’s death while detained at the MCC but came to conclude that Epstein’s death, an\napparent suicide, was the result of “a perfect storm of screw-ups.”!\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News, Barr stated he was “livid” when he learned that\nJeffrey Epstein had commited suicide and “happy that they had goten Ms. Maxwell.” ? When\nasked if the government had Maxwell's security “locked in” to ensure she would neither be able to\nkill herself or be harmed, Barr answered, with a mixture of laughter and a smile on his face: “Yes.\nWe have asked them to tell us specifically the protocols they're follouing, and we have a number\nof redundant systems to monitor the situation.” Id.

Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 27 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations l2l\n\nHorvath, M., & Broun, J.

That said, the Defense is of course free to cross-\nexamine Dr. Rocchio about hou she evaluates her patients.\n\nThe Defense also suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s experience is based on an unrepresentative\nsample of alleged victims because her patients self-selected seeking <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> with her. Yet the\nDefense does not explain why Dr. Rocchio’s experience with a large number of patients would\nnot be applicable to the alleged victims in this case. To the extent the Defense wishes to argue\nthat Dr. Rocchio’s experience is under-representative, that is a topic for cross-examination.\n\nFurther, the Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s experience treating victims of sexual\nabuse does not make her an expert on grooming, which would require experience with\nperpetrators themselves. This argument overlooks the fact that, as she testified, Dr. Rocchio also\nrelied on literature that includes studies of sexual abusers’ reported behaviors. But more\nimportantly, the Court concludes, as other courts like the Ninth Circuit have, that extensive\nexperience with victims can be used to study perpetrators’ process of victimization. See\nHalamek, 5 F.4th at lo88. That is especially so here where the crux of Dr. Rocchio’s expected\ntestimony is the effect that grooming behaviors have on the minor, not the perpetrator’s mental\nstate when performing the behaviors.\n\nSecond, the Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are relevant to the Government’s\ncase against Ms. Maxwell. Two points of law bear mention here. For one, as the Second Circuit\nhas explained, expert testimony cannot “constitute evaluations of witness credibility”—that is,\nexpert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s] directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on\nthe credibility of trial testimony from” specific fact witnesses. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\nAdditionally, if the expert’s “opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common\nknouledge and common sense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagellof 24\nsexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography’). To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d.

Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\nqualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “qualified expert” in something, she is not a “qualified\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial relationship with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6. If this were right, though, one would\nexpect the government to explain hou clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the\ntruth — in other words, hou clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of 52\n\nBut that’s not what the government does. Instead, right after claiming that “[c]linical\npsychologists are not so credulous,” the government essentially says to Ms. Maxwell, “Hou dare\nyou?” In the government’s words, “The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim\nthat Dr. Rocchio has been misled by hundreds of patients who sought professional <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for\ntraumatic events that did not occur.” Resp. at l6.\n\nIn this way, and in one breath, the government atests that Rocchio is “not so credulous.”\nBut in the next breath, the government asks this Court to assume that Rocchio “has [not] been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for traumatic events that did\nnot occur.” In other words, the government asks this Court to assume Rocchio’s patients are\ntelling the truth, just as Rocchio does. Apparently Rocchio is “so credulous.” But there is no\nreason this Court should be.\n\nThe government next notes that the term “grooming-by-proxy” “appears nouhere in the\nGovernment’s expert notice.” Resp. at 26. That’s hardly surprising, though, because there is no\nreliable way to assess or analyze if one individual “grooming” a minor to facilitate abuse by\nsomeone else, even though that is exactly what the government says Ms. Maxwell did.\n\nAs detailed today is Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 4l2 motion, the Indictment alleges “grooming”\nor “normalization” of sexual behavior by Ms. Maxwell over a dozen times. The government does\nnot, houever, contend that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” anyone for her oun benefit; instead, the\ngovernment contends that she “groomed” them for Epstein’s benefit. But as the government does\nnot dispute, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study, nothing—to validate\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy (even if she doesn’t use that phrase).°\n\n° The articles and cases the government cites involve alleged grooming behavior by the preparator\nof the abuse, not alleged grooming behavior by a third party.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo69o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim.

Or there might be studies where you're\n\nl6 looking at <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims and what are some of the issues\nl7 that patients are bringing to <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> that need to be\n\nl8 addressed, so the strategies that they experienced might come\nl9 out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing\n2o various experts, asking them what are strategies.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer. [CONFIDENTIAL] SDNY _GM_ SUPP _oo2l9ooo.mov.\n\nThe materials reviewed reflect that Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant man who was flawed\nby enduring personality traits familiar to psychiatrists as “Cluster B personality traits,” found\namong those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007526.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 33 of 375\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the normal and disturbed child.

I have a bachelor's degree with a dual major in psychology\nl3 and English.\n\nl4 Q. Where did you receive your master's from?\n\nl5 A. The University of Rhode Island.\n\nl6 Q. And you mentioned your Ph.D. Where did you receive that\nl7 from?\n\nl8 A. That was also from the University of Rhode Island.\n\nl9 Q. What is clinical psychology?\n2o A. Clinical psychology is the study of human thoughts and\n2l behaviors, both abnormal and normal. We also study\n22 psychopathology, <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> methods.

So individual therapy, marital couple\n\nl5 therapy, for example.\n\nl6 Q. During the course of your graduate studies at the\n\nl7 University of Rhode Island, what if any topics in particular\nl8 did you focus on?\n\nl9 A. I focused in particular on areas related to social\n2o psychology, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and\n2l eating disorders.\n22 Q. What is traumatic stress?\n23 A. \"Traumatic stress\" refers to a stressor that overwhelms an\n24 individual's person -- ability to cope. In the DSM-V it's\n25 defined as a stressor that is severe enough, quite severe, and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l3 of l59l2\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl I then also spent another six months working at the\n\n2 Yale Psychiatric Institute on an inpatient and partial hospital\n3 unit, treating adolescents.

After you received your Ph.D., what did you do next in your\n7 career?\n\n8 A. I had a full-year equivalent of a postdoctoral fellouship.\n9 During that year I worked in a partial hospital program. I\n\nlo treated patients in an outpatient psychotherapy practice, and I\nll taught courses at the college level in psychology.\n\nl2 Q. Where did you do your postdoctoral fellouship?\n\nl3 A. It was in Rhode Island. I worked in a private practice\n\nl4 seting in Rhode Island, as well as Butler Hospital.\n\nl5 Specifically I worked in a partial hospital program that\n\nl6 utilized dialectical behavior therapy in the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of\n\nl7 women.\n\nl8 Q. What issues did you focus on during your postdoctoral\n\nl9 fellouship?\n2o A. So dialectical behavior therapy is the primary issue that I\n2l focused on, in terms of my training, and it's a <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>\n22 method that has been found -- there's a lot of evidence; it was\n23 developed and has been shoun to be highly effective for a\n24 chronically suicidal and self-injurious population of women.\n25 It's since been generalized to a variety of populations.

In the course of your career, have you treated and\n\nll evaluated individuals who have experienced or reported\n\nl2 experiencing childhood sexual abuse?\n\nl3 A. I have.\n\nl4 Q.

No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true.

Can you describe at a high level the scientific literature\n2o upon which your opinions on grooming are based?\n2l A. So there have been a number of studies over time that have\n22 looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Including the instruction therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general instruction on credibility, Instruction 44. That instruction already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is unavailable to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v.

As to that category of testimony, the government’s argument\nborders on the frivolous.\n\nWhile talking with Mr. Hamilton about Mr. Epstein in 2ol9 or 2o2o, Kate made two\nstatements laying bare her motive and bias. i\neee\neS\nee hc law is clear that\nMs. Maxwell can ask Mr. Hamilton about these statements.\n\n“The law is well setled in this Circuit, as in others, that bias of a witness is not a\ncollateral issue and extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove that a witness has a motive to testify\nfalsely.” United States v. Harvey, 547 F.2d 72o, 722 (2d Cir. l976) (citing cases). And “[t]he law\nof evidence has long recognized that a cross-examiner is not required to ‘take the answer’ of a\nwitness concerning possible bias, but may proffer extrinsic evidence, including the testimony of\nother witnesses, to prove the facts shouing a bias in favor of or against a party.” /d. (quoting\nMcCormick, Evidence, § 4l (2d Ed. l972)) (emphasis added). Indeed, “Special <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> is\naccorded evidence which is probative of a special motive to lie ‘for if believed it colors every bit\nof testimony given by the witness whose motives are bared.’” /d.

And the government’s inability to understand\nthe statement goes to weight, not admissibility. The government is free to argue to the jury that\nKate’s statement is ambiguous or meaningless.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009238.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBmctien en O34 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 36 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, vy\n\nPAUL M.

He (our father) was a pouerful\nand dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine\nunder his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable\nto his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to\nbecoming very vulnerable to abusive andpouerful men who would be able to\ntake advantage of her innate good nature.\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour before she met\nEpstein. Nor did she shou any after leaving him, which she eventually managed\nto do. The effect of our father's psychologically abusive <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of her,\nforeshadoued Epstein's oun ability to exploit, manipulate and control her.\n\nExhibit A.\n\nAnother psychotherapist and family friend of some 55 years, James Martin Hollomon,\n\nrecalls his observations of Ghislaine’s father:\n[T]heir father was narcissistic, demanding and highly controlling. He let\nthem knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So,\nall the kids knew they had to \"make it on their oun\" despite the wealth and\nprivilege in which they were grouing up. As I got to knou each of these kids,\nincluding Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one worked very\nhard at their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their\nfather's and mother's respect through their intelligence and their oun hard work.\n\nExhibit B.\n\nHer twin sisters, Christine Malina Maxwell and Isabel Maxwell, atest to Ghislaine’s\n\nwork ethic:\n[W]e were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was notalways perfect.\nUnfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother\nMichaelwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he\nremained in a coma until his death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite\nof this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to adapt and to become a productive\nand caring human being.\n[B]oth of our parents had an incredible work ethic.

As the trial record establishes, Maxwell met Jane shortly after her\nfather passed away, and her family was struggling to make ends meet. Annie’s mother was\nstruggling to raise her daughters alone. Carolyn was living alone with her mother, who was an\naddict. It is not a coincidence that all of Maxwell’s victims came from single-mother households.\nNot only did her conduct exhibit a callous disregard for other human beings, but her practice of\ntargeting vulnerable victims reflects her view that struggling young girls could be treated like\ndisposable objects.\n\nOnce the victims were selected, Maxwell played an essential role in the conspiracy by\ngrooming victims for abuse. Maxwell did this by forging trust with her victims so that they could\nbe sexually exploited. As Dr. Rocchio explained, the psychological harms of sexual abuse are\ngreater where, as here, the abuse arises from a relationship of trust with the abuser:\n\nTrust is central often in the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of someone who’s been\nsexually abused, because it’s often the part that is most confusing\nand also causes the most — the most harm.

Indeed, the Court was already under\nthe impression that the Defense intended to pursue this line of cross-examination after the\nDaubert hearing. Nov. lo Tr. at l57 (“[D]o you intend to impeach any witnesses based on\nsubstance abuse? .. . Yes.”).\n\nBut the extensive case law cited by the Defense about cross-examining witnesses on their\nsubstance use does not justify the request to admit Dr. Hall’s testimony on substance use and\na For example, in United States v. Vitale, the district court gave the defense “wide\nlatitude when cross-examining [the witness] about his drug use and rehabilitation, including\nquestions about the effects that the drugs had on his ability to perceive events when they\noccurred as well as on his memory at the time of trial.” 459 F.3d at l96. The district court did\nnot, houever, permit the defense to admit the witness’s drug rehabilitation <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> records into\nevidence. /d. Citing Sasso, the Second Circuit affirmed, explaining that through cross-\nexamination alone, “the jury was well aware of . . . [the witness’s] drug abuse and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>\nhistory.” Jd. The Second Circuit has made such a distinction—permiting cross-examination on\ndrug use but excluding a formal diagnosis of| | several cases. E.g., DiPaolo, 8o4\nF.2d at 23o; Dobson v. Walker, l5o F. App’x 49, 52 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (explaining that cross-\nexamination about a witness’s drug use before witnessing a murder would be admissible, but the\ngeneral fact that the witness uses drugs is not). The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def. Br. at\nl3, held only that a defendant had the right to review a witness’s medical records and cross-\nexamine the witness about his drug use, Robinson, 583 F.3d at l27l-75.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Pagel5ofl7\nor emotional condition, her statements made to Dr. Hall ing about events that took place\nyears earlier cannot be said to be “then-existing.” /d. The Defense also says Alleged Victim 4’s\nstatements were “made for medical diagnosis or <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>.” Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4). The Court\nfinds that this may be a permissible basis for admiting some of Alleged Victim 4’s statements,\nthough they must be “made for . . . medical diagnosis or <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>,” must “describe[ ] medical\nhistory; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and must\notherwise satisfy Rules 4ol and 4o3.

But without additional detail from the Defense on which\nportions of Dr. Hall’s testimony it would seek to admit under this exception, the Court cannot\nmake a definitive ruling.\n\nThe Defense does not mention Alleged Victim 4’s a cited by Dr. Hall in\nhis report. The Court concludes that Alleged Victim 4’s LF are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o9. Dr. Hall’s report is not clear on the details of Alleged Victim 4’s\nee\nes These incidents,\nhouever, are nou all over lo years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest act or false\nstatement,” and, for i. admiting the evidence is not necessary to fairly\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 6o9 (a), (b), (d).\n\n' The Defense also argues that Alleged Victim 4’s statements would be “admissible for their\neffect on Dr. Hall in forming his opinion.” Def. Br. at l5. But, like Rule 7o3, this justification is\na relevant basis for admission only if the validity of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses is put in question.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Page6of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\nSheet 3D — Supervised Release\nEEE JudementPage 6 of\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: S2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSPECIAL CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION\nYou shall submit your person, and any property, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communication,\ndata storage devices, cloud storage or media, and effects to a search by any United States Probation Officer, and if\nneeded, with the assistance of any law enforcement.

Compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThree of the motions argue that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable\nand oppressive because the accusers were guaranteed confidentiality under the EVCP Protocol.\nEVCP Mot. at 9-l2; Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at 2-3. The government does not\nmake such an argument. Gov. Mot. at l-6. Some motions even imply that the confidentiality of\nthe materials is reason enough to quash the subpoena. Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably privileged. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F. Supp. 2d 3l7, 324-25\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (denying motion to quash defense subpoena for tax returns even though the\nreturns might be privileged, saying “cases demonstrate . . . a potential exception to the tax return\nprivilege where, as here, the interests in truth and a criminal defendant’s rights are both\nimplicated’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 23 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell does not seek production of materials\nrelated to other claimants, and there is no reason to think that production of the materials related\nto Ms. Maxwell’s accusers—who have not acted to keep confidential their claims against Mr.\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell—will somehou impair the functioning of the EVCP in working with\nothers. Indeed, the EVCP is nou closed and there is no more work to be done—the cut-off for\nclaims has passed, the money has been paid, and the fund is closed.\n\nMoreover, the lack of an objection by either Accuser-l or Accuser-4 belies the argument\nthat compliance with Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive, at least as\nto them. See Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d at 564 (concluding compliance would not be\nunreasonable or oppressive, even though the government moved to quash, given “the absence of\nobjections from all but one doctor’).\n\nFinally, Ms. Maxwell’s due process right to equal <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> would be violated were she\nnot entitled to inspect the materials simply because they are “confidential.” U.S. Const. amend.\nV.

Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research\n23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they\n24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in\n25 these sexually abusive circumstances.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool233l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 47 of 228 T23\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl And then finally, you have interviews and research\n\n2 that's done with professionals in the field who work with both\n3 victims and perpetrators.

I also take into account\n\nl8 that, as a high-profile defendant charged and convict of sex\n\nl9 offenses against minors, Ms. Maxwell faces security risks and\n2o has endured additional isolation and surveillance beyond the\n2l typical pretrial detainee.\n22 That said, I largely reject the defense's primary\n23 writen contention that Ms. Maxwell has been singled out for\n24 uniquely harsh and punishing <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>.

So individual therapy, marital couple\n\nl5 therapy, for example.\n\nl6 Q. During the course of your graduate studies at the\n\nl7 University of Rhode Island, what if any topics in particular\nl8 did you focus on?\n\nl9 A. I focused in particular on areas related to social\n2o psychology, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and\n2l eating disorders.\n22 Q. What is traumatic stress?\n23 A. \"Traumatic stress\" refers to a stressor that overwhelms an\n24 individual's person -- ability to cope.

After you received your Ph.D., what did you do next in your\n7 career?\n8 A. I had a full-year eguivalent of a postdoctoral fellouship.\n9 During that year I worked in a partial hospital program. I\nlo treated patients in an outpatient psychotherapy practice, and I\nll taught courses at the college level in psychology.\nl2 Q. Where did you do your postdoctoral fellouship?\nl3 A. It was in Rhode Island. I worked in a private practice\nl4 seting in Rhode Island, as well as Butler Hospital.\nl5 Specifically I worked in a partial hospital program that\nl6 utilized dialectical behavior therapy in the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of\nl7 women.\nl8 Q. What issues did you focus on during your postdoctoral\nl9 fellouship?\n2o A. So dialectical behavior therapy is the primary issue that I\n2l focused on, in terms of my training, and it's a <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>\n22 method that has been found -- there's a lot of evidence; it was\nao developed and has been shoun to be highly effective for a\n24 chronically suicidal and self-injurious population of women.\n25 It's since been generalized to a variety of populations.

You mentioned a forensic practice. In your forensic\n\n9 practice, what sort of work do you do?\n\nlo A. I provide expert consultation, psychological, forensic\n\nll psychological evaluations, and expert witness testimony in\n\nl2 civil and criminal cases, most typically where traumatic stress\nl3 and/or interpersonal violence are somehou related to the mater\nl4 at hand, although I've also done other types of forensic work.\nl5 Q. Hou does your clinical -- excuse me -- your forensic\n\nl6 practice compare to your clinical practice?\n\nl7 A. My forensic practice is very different. As a clinician,\n\nl8 I'm working with individuals in the clinical room providing\n\nl9 evidence-based <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> for the problems that they're\n2o presenting to me and developing a relationship over time. AS a\n2l forensic psychologist, I'm taking on more of an investigative\n22 role, and my work is to answer some particular psycho-legal\n23 guestion from an objective perspective, and it involves\n24 certainly never taking what someone has to say at face value\n25 but, rather, a fairly well-established process of multiple\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool489l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014893.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Pagel7ofl58 l7\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. As a clinical psychologist, what issues or areas have you\n\n2 specialized in?\n\n3 A. Earlier in my career, as I said, I specialized in the\n\n4 assessment and <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of eating disorders, and throughout my\n5 career I've specialized in the area of traumatic stress and\n\n6 interpersonal violence.\n\n7 Q. Since about when have you focused on traumatic stress and\n\n8 interpersonal violence?\n\n9 A. Since graduate school.\n\nlo QO. In the course of your career, have you treated and\n\nll evaluated individuals who have experienced or reported\n\nl2 experiencing childhood sexual abuse?\n\nl3 A. I have.\n\nl4 Q. What is childhood sexual abuse?\n\nl5 A. \"Childhood sexual abuse\" refers to a process by which a\n\nl6 child is involved, engaged in sexual activity by an adult or\n\nl7 sometimes by a peer who's generally three to five years older\nl8 than them, but it involves engaging the child in sexual\n\nl9 activity when they either do not consent or are unable to\n2o consent.\n2l Q.

Also, there have\nll been some trainings that I have done online. For example, I\n\nl2 participate in a weekly webinar on issues relevant to the signs\nl3 and practice of forensic psychology that is conducted by\n\nl4 experts in the field. I think that covers it.\n\nl5 Q. In what way do you train others?\n\nl6 A. I have done a variety of things. So I have been on the\n\nl7 ethics commitee for the psychological association and also on\nl8 the American psychological association. So part of what I do\nl9 is we have a call in opportunity for our members, and we\n2o provide education about ethical issues to -- and consultation\n2l to individuals who request that form of assistance.

Are you aware of other psychologists treating and\n\n3 evaluating patients that reported behaviors consistent with\n\n4 grooming?\n\n5 A. Absolutely. It's common in the field.\n\n6 Q. Hou do you knou that?\n\n7 A. Through my review of the clinical research, it's something\n8 that's well documented in articles or books, chapters that have\n9 been writen, for example, about hou to provide <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> to\nlo patients. It's writen in the literature around what sorts of\nll symptoms might patients present with and why, what are some of\nl2 the common difficulties. Of course, it's writen in case\n\nl3 studies. And then through my conversations with peers and, of\nl4 course, trainings I have atended conducted by experts in the\nl5 field.\n\nl6 Q. In your forensic practice, have you evaluated survivors of\nl7 childhood sexual abuse?\n\nl8 A. I have.\n\nl9 Q. What does forensic evaluation of someone who has reported\n2o childhood sexual abuse entail?\n2l A. So in general, a forensic evaluation is a multistep\nae process. As I mentioned before, it's not just talking to\n23 someone.

No, I do not.\n3 Q. Can you explain?\n4 A. So ina clinical seting, it is not my role to determine\n5 whether something is or is not true. Of course, when someone\n6 is telling me something, I'm using my skill and experience to\n7 take that information in and also to inquire, as I communicate\n8 to that individual and provide <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>. But as I mentioned\n9 earlier, I don't go out and try to see, well, this person is\nlo having trauma related to a motor vehicle accident or a shooting\nll on the job, I don't go and ask them to provide me with\nl2 newspaper articles to verify whether that event happened.\nl3 Q. Hou do the grooming that you have seen in your forensic\nl4 practice compare to what you have seen in your clinical\nl5 practice?\nl6 A. There's remarkable consistency in what I see in my work\nl7 over time in my forensic practice, my clinical practice and\nl8 what I have been trained and what's in the literature.\nl9 Q. Can you describe at a high level the scientific literature\n2o upon which your opinions on grooming are based?\n2l A. So there have been a number of studies over time that have\nae looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals.

Also, there are researchers who have\n6 come to be knoun in a particular field, so I might look at who\n7 the authors are and where the research is being conducted.\n\n8 Q. Beyond what you have already described, can you give any\n\n9 examples of hou studies are conducted?\n\nlo A. They're conducted in a variety of ways. So for example --\nll I think I may have already described it -- but there are a\n\nl2 variety of ways people might interview offenders and ask them\nl3 what they do, what strategies and tactics they use. There\n\nl4 might be studies that look at victims reporting what their\n\nl5 experiences are. Or there might be studies where you're\n\nl6 looking at <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims and what are some of the issues\nl7 that patients are bringing to <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> that need to be\n\nl8 addressed, so the strategies that they experienced might come\nl9 out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing\n2o various experts, asking them what are strategies. And then\n2l looking for what are the strategies that experts from a variety\nae of different fields agree upon, to a degree of certainty, and\n23 what do these professionals agree are part of what they see.\n24 Q.

Trauma is a continuum, so that is one of the definitions of\n7 \"trauma,\" but other things have been found to be traumatic in\n\n8 individuals’ experiences that do not necessarily rise to the\n\n9 level of criterion A in PTSD. For example, there's a whole\n\nlo \"nother section in the DSM called \"Other Stressor and Trauma\n\nll Disorders\" that could refer to other traumatic events that\n\nl2 don't fit that specific definition, but childhood sexual abuse\nl3 is commonly understood to fall under the definition of \"sexual\nl4 violence.\" So to that degree, yes.\n\nl5 Q.

I focused on the general practice of clinical psychology,\nl3 but in particular traumatic stress, forensic psychology, and\n\nl4 eating disorders.\n\nl5 Q. What is traumatic stress?\n\nl6 A. Traumatic stress refers to any event that overwhelms an\n\nl7 individual's ability to cope. At the more severe end, as\n\nl8 described in the DSM, which is a manual we use for diagnosis,\nl9 it's defined as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious\n2o bodily injury, or sexual violence.\n2l Q.

So I provide <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> to patients, the vast majority of\n\n4 whom have experienced some form of traumatic stress.

Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n\n4 A. Sure. Yeah. On the individual level, for example, when\n\n5 I'm providing <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> and I'm talking with someone who's been\n6 abused, we'll be talking about hou that abuse came to be. And\n7 often they'll be talking about the development of the\n\n8 relationship and hou they felt about this person and hou it\n\n9 unfolded over time.\n\nlo And then we've also done scientific research that's\n\nll been done to also identify retrospectively the grooming\n\nl2 process.\n\nl3 Q. Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\nl4 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\nl5 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n\nl6 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n\nl7 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\nl8 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\nl9 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n2o be called kind of the victim literature.\n2l But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French nationality by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French nationality’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their nationality to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French nationality was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-\nperson atorney-client visit.

In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021187.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya kee 3536o38, Pagel5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nIs Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\ni As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021254.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8o 3536o38, Page82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.®’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”®* in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility. Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp:/(www.dc.state.fl.us/cc/ccforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n89 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021310.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel38 of 258\nSA-l36\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a subsequent email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “‘as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span>, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison.

FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client.

The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF.

These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.3°’\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”*88 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of crime victims.”**° The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.4°° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*°!

In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat ‘“[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”3?°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\nane Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla. Feb. 2l, 2ol9).\n\n255\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021458.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page28 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l462\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021633.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AST 3536o39, Page2o3 of 2l7\n88\nM6s2Max2\nl THE COURT: Thank you for your patience.\n2 As I have stated, the guideline range applicable to\n3 this case is l88 to 235 months' imprisonment.\n4 Under the Supreme Court's decision in a case called\n5 Booker and related cases, the guideline range is only one\n6 factor that the Court must consider in deciding the appropriate\n7 sentence.

Formal interviews were\nnot conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations\nby other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special\nInvestigative Staff follouing a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since\nthe original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the\nbeginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely\nlimited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish\nconverging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,\ninformation typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support\nactionable findings and recommendations is limited.\nName: Jeffrey Epstein\nRegister Number: 763l8-o54\nDate of Death: o8-lo-2ol9\nPrepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator,\nPsychology Services Branch, Central Office\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nMr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August lo, 2ol9, while housed\nat the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills,\nformer Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a\npsychological reconstruction. _The team consisted National Suicide Prevention\nCoordinator, Central Office; Sex Offender <span class=\"highlight\">Treatment</span> Programs Coordinator,\nCentral Office Pee ental Health <span class=\"highlight\">Treatment</span> Coordinator, Central Office; and\nCorrectional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents.

The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide\nwatch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book.

Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of\nthe inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”\nThe Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with\na history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\nidentification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates\nentering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their <span class=\"highlight\">treatment</span> needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist.
