Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004205.jpg": "Casask 2olG-GN89aPARWsP asyeuMneAePss AritecheAensl pdgage df afil2\nand (c) facts demonstrating that the burden and expense of the discovery is justified by the needs\nof this case. Indeed, she has not established that the testimony is even relevant to the actual\nissues in this mater. Plaintiff's inability to establish these factors requires denial of the motion.\nI. PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST IS PREMATURE\n\nFirst, the request to exceed the presumptive ten-deposition limit is premature. “[C]ourts\ngenerally will not grant leave to expand the number of depositions until the moving party has\nexhausted the ten depositions permited as of right under Rule 3o(a)(2)(A) or the number\nstipulated to by the opposing party,” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., No. 3:o6-CV-\n232 (CFD), 2oo6 WL l52597o, at *2 (D. Conn. May 25, 2oo6).\n\nThis guideline makes sense because a “moving party must not only justify those\ndepositions it wishes to take, but also the depositions it has already taken.” /d. (citing Barrou v.\nGreenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2o2 F.R.D. 48o, 482 (N.D.Tex. 2ool)). This rule is in place because\n“a party could indirectly circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum alloted\nnumber to those that she could not justify under the Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek{[ ]\nleave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate.” Jd. at 483.\n\nHere, Plaintiff seeks a pre-emptive determination that she should be permited l7\ndepositions, almost twice the presumptive limit, yet her proposed depositions are not calculated\nto lead to admissible evidence in this case. By way of example, Plaintiff identifies Nadia\nMarcinkova, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or Sarah Vickers), and Jeffrey Epstein as\nalleged “co-conspirators” with each other. She requests the depositions of each. Plaintiff\nanticipates each will invoke the Fifth Amendment — in other words, she will not obtain any\ndiscoverable information from them.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004206.jpg": "Casask 4olg -Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FildechemMene! pdgage cf afil2\n\nPlaintiff makes a bizarre argument that somehou this testimony can be used to create an\nadverse inference against Ms. Maxwell,’ despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell did not invoke the\nFifth Amendment and she testified fully and answered every question posed to her with the only\nexception the irrelevant and harassing questions Plaintiff posed to her concerning her adult,\nconsensual sexual activities. In other words, depositions of Marcincova, <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> and Epstein\nwould serve Plaintiff's goal to make a convoluted legal argument, not to actually seek\ndiscoverable information. In light of this, the “burden or expense of the proposed discovery\noutweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the parties' resources, the\nimportance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving\nthe issues.” Atkinson v.

She should\nnot be rewarded with a pre-emptive carte blanche in advance to take additional depositions.\nIl.

As discussed above, such invocation has no\nbearing on the issues in this mater. Moreover, it is obviously cumulative and duplicative.\n\nPlaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any\ninformation from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject mater of their\nexpected testimony. Thus, it is unclear hou these individuals have information that differs from\nor would add to the other proposed deponents. It is the Plaintiff's burden to explain to the Court\nwhy these depositions should be permited if they exceed the presumptive limit, why the\ninformation would not be cumulative, and its relevance to the important issues in the action, or\nthe importance of the discovery in resolving those issues. She simply fails to provide any\ninformation by which the Court can assess these factors, and thus should not be permited to\nexceed the deposition limit based on her proffer.\nTi.

(Tr.\n\nl684; Def.

There is no need for Scarola to testify to information already obtained\nfrom Carolyn, and it obviously does not impeach Carolyn for Scarola to confirm her answers.\n\nNearly all of additional testimony the defendant proposes to elicit from Scarola is irrelevant\nand non-impeaching. It does not mater that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Leter at\n2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to contact Carolyn\nprobative (id. at 3).' It says nothing about Carolyn that Scarola copied counsel for other victims\non an email. (id. at 2). None of that information impeaches Carolyn’s testimony in any way—\nrather, it is entirely consistent with her testimony.”\n\nThe defendant argues this testimony is relevant to “establish the timeline of Carolyn’s\ncooperation with the government and her motive and bias in testifying against Ms. Maxwell, in\nparticular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and uncooperative until there was the prospect\n' The Government would stipulate to the specific dates of meetings between Scarola, Carolyn, and\nthe Government.

The government was correct that the proof at trial established, at\nmost, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,\nrather than multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the Korfant factors confirms that\nthe three conspiracies charged in Counts One, Three, and Five are virtually identical and are\ntherefore multiplicitous.*\nl. Overlap of Participants and Time\n\nThere is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged conspiracies were\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were\n“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire ten-year time period\ncharged in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:l3; Tr. 2842:ll-2845:9. Epstein was the principal abuser\nand Ms. Maxwell was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second in\ncommand.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, such as Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>,\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from its inception in l994 through its\nconclusion in 2oo4. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into multiple\nconspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved throughout the\nduration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nFurthermore, the Mann Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at\ntrial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer—and spanned the same relevant ten-year period,\nl994-2oo4. Although the sex trafficking conspiracy (Count Five) related only to Carolyn and\nlasted for a shorter time period from 2ool-2oo4, that count, which was later added to the S2\nIndictment, did not describe a separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it was simply a subset\n* The first factor, an analysis of the criminal offenses charged in “successive indictments,” is inapplicable here\nbecause Ms. Maxwell has been charged with two § 37l conspiracies in the same indictment. The multifactor test,\nhouever, remains applicable. See Cooper, 886 F.3d at l55.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-oooo895l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3lof5l\n\n2. Overt Acts\n\nCounts Three and Five of the S2 Indictment charged different overt acts. There is no\noverlap whatsoever in the overt acts between these two counts in the S2 Indictment. The defendant\ndoes not appear to argue otherwise, (see Def. Mot. at 24), nor could she. The absence of\noverlapping overt acts underscores the fact that these counts charged different conspiracies.\nAccordingly, this factor weighs strongly against the defendant’s claim of multiplicity.\n\n3. Overlap in Participants\n\nTurning to the overlap of participants, the evidence at trial established that some—but\nimportantly, not all—participants overlapped between the two conspiracy schemes charged in\nCounts Three and Five. In any event, even if the participants had been identical in both\nconspiracies, the identity of the participants alone would be insufficient to support a claim of\nmultiplicity. See United States v. Coleman Com. Carrier, Inc.,2l9 F. Supp. 2d 563, 565 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo2) (“[T]he existence of a single conduit does not establish proof of a single conspiracy[.]’’)\n(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669).\n\nHere, although the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five both involved the\ndefendant and Epstein, the S2 Indictment charged that, with respect to Count Five, Epstein’s\nemployees participated in contacting a minor victim to schedule appointments for sexualized\nmassages. See Dkt. No. l87, § 25(d). At trial, a victim who testified under her first name, Carolyn,\ntestified about receiving such calls from Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, who worked as a personal assistant to\nEpstein. (Tr. l527). The evidence at trial established that <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> started working for Epstein in\nor about the early 2ooos. (See, e.g., Tr. 832, l889). Carolyn also testified about an incident in\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9593", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 32 of5l\nwhich <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> took nude photographs of Carolyn for Epstein. (Tr. l529). In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking conspiracy who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. Geographic Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking conspiracy which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on interstate commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines. (Tr. 3o4l-42). As a result, the conspiracy in Count Three was focused on travel to\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9594", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel8 of 24\n\nThe government’s decision to add Counts Five and Six, which are based on the same\nconduct, did not suddenly convert Carolyn’s abuse and the conduct she described in the Palm\nBeach residence from 2ool-2oo4 into a separate, distinct conspiracy. In fact, the conduct in the\n2ooos that Carolyn described was no different than the conduct in the l99os that Jane described.\nLike Carolyn, Jane testified that Epstein gave her money after almost every sexual encounter\nwith him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support a sex trafficking charge. (Tr. 3ol-\no2). Indeed, the government concedes that the only reason it did not expand Count Five to\ninclude Jane and Annie Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to include\nCarolyn’s abuse) was that the sex trafficking statute was not enacted until after their abuse had\noccurred. (Opp. at 28). Had that legal impediment not existed, the government could have, and\nno doubt would have, broadened the date range of Count Five to l994-2oo4, as it had done with\nCounts One and Three, and included overt acts related to Jane. Instead, the government included\na more narrou sex trafficking count based primarily on Carolyn’s allegations from 2ool-2oo4,\nbut still framed all of the charges in the Indictment as the product of a single, decade-long\nscheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to “groom” and recruit minor girls to be sexually\nabused at Epstein’s various residences from l994 to 2oo4. (See Ind. 4 l-2, Overview Section).\nAccordingly, the offenses charged in the Indictment support a finding of multiplicity.\n\nB. Overlap in Participants, Time, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government makes a half-hearted atempt to deny the obvious overlap between\nCounts Three and Five in participants, time period, and geographic scope. (Opp. at 3o-32). For\nexample, the government argues that some “but importantly, not all” of the participants in the\ntwo conspiracies overlapped, and notes that Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, who scheduled massage appointments\nfor Epstein in Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2ooos during the time period of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. (Opp. at 3o-3l). But in the end, the government concedes, as it must,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l9 of 24\nthat the core participants of the conspiracies—Epstein and Ms. Maxwell—were consistent\nthroughout and that Carolyn was a victim of the conspiracies charged in both Count Three and\nCount Five. (/d.) The addition of Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> as a co-conspirator touards the end of the\nconspiracy does not create multiple conspiracies. See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385,\n387 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“[C]hanges in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy\ninto multiple conspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be involved\nthroughout the duration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government also argues that although the time period of Count Five (2ool-2oo4) was\nentirely contained within the time period of Count Three (l994-2oo4), there was no significant\ntemporal overlap because “the gravamen of the offense conduct for Count Three occurred in the\nl99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count Five took place in the 2ooos.” (Opp. at 3l).\nThat is non-sensical. Count Three charges a conspiracy lasting continuously from l994-2oo4.\nJust because three of the witnesses testified about conduct in the l99os and one of the witnesses\ntestified about conduct in the 2ooos, that does not mean that the l99os conduct was somehou\nmore important or more relevant to Count Three than the 2ooos conduct. As charged, the\nconspiracy spanned the entire time period. Hence, the temporal overlap between Count Three\nand Count Five was not “minimal,” as the government contends. (Opp. at 3l). It was complete.\nThe time period of Count Five was entirely contained within, and overlapped with, the time\nperiod of Count Three.\n\nFinally, the government disingenuously argues that the geographic scope of the two\nconspiracies did not overlap because Count Three “was focused on travel to New York,”\nwhereas Count Five “largely concerned conduct that took place in Florida.” (Opp. at 3l-32).\nHere, the government is talking out of both sides of its mouth. The government argued\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pageloof 45\nroles played by those participants, significantly favors the Defendant as to the second Korfant\nfactor. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *ll.\n\nThe Government responds that the Count Five conspiracy included Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, who\nwas not involved in Count Three. Yet <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. F.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct conspiracy,\nparticularly if key members of the conspiracy remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2oo8). <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>’s participation beginning in 2ool\ntherefore does not shift the import of the second Korfant factor.\n\nOverlap of time. The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one conspiracy\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. See Araujo,\n2ol8 WL 3222527, at *6.\n\nSimilarity of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in\noperations. The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of\nminor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial. The Government called as an\nexpert witness Dr. Lisa Rocchio, who identified the typical steps in sexual abusers’ grooming of\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo376", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l3 of 29\nvariance would provide just punishment for the offense and promote respect for the law because\nit would punish Ms. Maxwell only for the conduct for which she was directly responsible, rather\nthan artificially inflating her sentence based on two months’ worth of Epstein’s criminal conduct\nin which she was not involved.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that Ms. Maxwell did anything in furtherance of the\nconspiracy in November or December 2oo4. In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired.

Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 793 (7\" Cir. 2oo6)\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 29\nwho was his employee. According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\n<span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>. Rather, <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2. (Tr. 2332-33,\n2376-77).° Espinosa further testified that in the last two years of her employment (2ooo-2oo2),\n\n8 Larry Visoski initially testified that he thought Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. l39-4o). But he\nlater clarified on cross-examination that he “didn’t knou what her exact job” was and did not knou whether <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo438", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document662_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 29\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell ended their romantic relationship and “went their separate ways”: Ms.\nMaxwell “moved on” from Epstein, stopped coming into the office, started dating other men, and\neventually entered a long-term, commited relationship with Ted Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence\nwas Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 2o4). He further conceded that his best recollection was\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> was “an employee who worked with Epstein.” (Id.).\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>’s job\nresponsibilities were, but <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies\n\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nId. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\nGuidelines provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo565", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 _ Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

It is Ms. Maxwell’s position that any post-2oo4 statements by\nEpstein or other alleged co-conspirators were not in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue in this\ncase.\n\nThe first exemplar is a statement allegedly from Epstein to CC-l claiming that Ms.\nMaxwell “used to find girls for him.” This statement, or statements like it, cannot have been\nmade either in the course of or in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue here and are no more\nthan “idle chater.” Casual conversation about “past events,” “idle chater” between co-\nconspirators, or “merely narrative descriptions by one coconspirator of the acts of another” do\nnot qualify as statements in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Heinemann, 8ol F.2d\n86, 95 (2d Cir. l986); United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95, lo2 (2d Cir. l98o) (challenged\ntestimony “smack[ed] of nothing more than casual conversation about past events. It is difficult\nto envision hou it would have furthered the conspiracy.”).\n\nDuring 2oo5, according to the witness, she, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, an (and\nothers) were actively involved in soliciting females for Jeffrey Epstein. At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the conclusion that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and subjective interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said.

As this Court well knous, the accusers have been\nanything but consistent on this front.\n\nAccuser-4, for example, was first interviewed by the FBI about Epstein in 2oo7. At that\ntime, she told the agents that she was recruited to provide massages to Mr. Epstein by Virginia\nGiuffre, f/k/a Roberts, not Ms. Maxwell. She did not describe any grooming by Ms. Maxwell or\neven any participation by Ms. Maxwell in any crime. In this interview, Accuser-4 describes Ms.\nGiuffre as the person who shoued her what to do with Epstein and relates that Ms. Giuffre had\nsex with Mr. Epstein while Accuser-4 watched. Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> was her contact person and the\nperson who took naked photos of Accuser-4 in exchange for $5oo. Ms. Maxwell’s name does not\nappear in the FBI 3o2.\n\nShortly after this interview Accuser-4 sued Epstein and <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, not Maxwell. The first\ncomplaint, filed in Florida state court does not mention Ms. Maxwell. The complaint was\namended and removed to U.S. District Court and in over 2oo paragraphs Ms. Maxwell’s name\nappears not once. In her answers to writen discovery and in deposition testimony Accuser-4\ndoes not accuse Ms. Maxwell of any misconduct, but instead affirms that she has told the entire\nstory which, according to Accuser-4 (then), began in 2oo2 and ended in 2oo3.\n\nThese claims were setled by Accuser-4 for a substantial amount of money and a release\nwas executed for all claims against Epstein, <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, and related individuals or entities. It was not\nuntil after Epstein died and one month after the EVCF was created that the lawyers for Accuser-4\ncontacted the government to say that Accuser-4 wanted to meet.

They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> came at the end of my\n\nl9 emoloyment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.

Patasnik,\n2 89 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. l996). The Guidelines define a participant\n3 as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of\n4 the offense, but need not have been convicted. That's Section\n5 3Bl.l, comment note l.

I\n23 do conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n24 defendant led a criminally responsible participant.\n25 I further find that the defendant's criminal activity\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll56l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 43oflol 43\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl was extensive. Whether criminal activity is extensive is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity. District courts must determine\n5 the number of knouing participants in the criminal activity,\n\n6 the number of unknouing participants whose activities were\n\n7 organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal\n\n8 intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknouing\n\n9 participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal\n\nlo scheme. For example, a taxi driver that drives a defendant to\nll a crime scene would not count. That is an example from a case\nl2 called Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nl3 At all relevant times, the conspiracy proved at trial\nl4 included at least two knouing participants: Epstein and the\n\nl5 defendant. Beginning in 2oo2, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> joined, and\n\nl6 beginning in approximately 2ool, additional minor victims were\nl7 recruited through Virginia and Carolyn. Additionally, trial\n\nl8 evidence established that services were unknouingly provided by\nl9 various Epstein employees. For example, I credit Juan Alessi's\n2o testimony that follouing the defendant's instructions, he\n2l scheduled massage appointments, set up the massage table for\n22 appointments, cleaned up after sexualized massages, and on at\n23 least one occasion drove Virginia to an appointment.\n24 Additionally, both Visoski and Rodgers were employed\n25 as Epstein's pilots over the same time period as the counts of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll562", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 44oflol 44\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl conviction. Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at\n\n4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the\n\n5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of\n6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided\n7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the\n\n8 defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally\n\n9 available to the public. Again, I'm citing from the\n\nlo Carrozzella case, lo5 F.3d at 8o4.\n\nll In addition to these unknouing participants that\n\nl2 testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence\nl3 that there were other unknouing persons led by Maxwell.

PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, there are two\n\n3 principals at play here.\n\n4 The first is this is what is commonly referred to as\n\n5 impeachment by omission, which is a subset of impeachment by\n\n6 contradiction. Impeachment by omission typically occurs where\n7 there is a document or a statement where the witness would\n\n8 likely include whatever is omited, and this is such a\n\n9 document, and I am seeking to impeach by omission through this\nlo document. This is a complaint against two people that this\n\nll witness claims sexually abused her. It's not only against\n\nl2 Epstein, it's against one of Epstein's employees who is\n\nl3 highlighted in this complaint. The entire testimony by the\n\nl4 government here through this witness has dounplayed the role of\nl5 Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> and up-played the role of Ghislaine Maxwell, and\nl6 it is an impeachment by omission that, in 2oo8, shortly after\nl7 being interviewed by the FBI about the same subject mater with\nl8 counsel, there is no mention of Maxwell in this entire\n\nl9 complaint. I think that is significant under the facts of this\n2o case. So, I think it is admissible under that theory and there\n2l is ample federal law, First Circuit, this circuit, that\n22 supports that theory of impeachment by omission. And these\n23 factual paragraphs, I believe, are also impeaching of the\n24 witness's testimony because it is inconsistent with the things\n25 that she has claimed happened to her in addition to these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool32lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l98 of 264 l639\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl things that are in the complaint.\n\n2 THE COURT: So that's a long way of geting to my --\n3 responding to my first question.\n\n4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.\n\na THE COURT: What paragraph is inconsistent?\n\n6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, the fact that Ms. Maxwell --\n\n7 THE COURT: Point me to a paragraph.\n\n8 MR. PAGLIUCA: All of the paragraphs, your Honor.\n\n9 THE COURT: On the same theory you just pronounced?\nlo MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.\n\nll THE COURT: So then on your second theory, can you\nl2 point to any inconsistency?\n\nl3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, these are all omissions, your\nl4 Honor, factual. So paragraph 8, for example, the witness has\nl5 testified nou that she was the subject of penetration and\n\nl6 intercourse by Epstein. Paragraph 8 does not include that.\n\nl7 Paragraph 9, I think, is an expansion. We have only\nl8 <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, often calling -- excuse me. llA is what I'm Looking\nl9 at.\n2o THE COURT: So other than the omission theory, is\n2l there an inconsistency you're pointing to?\n22 MR. PAGLIUCA: No.\n23 THE COURT: Is there any other? I understand your\n24 omission theory, I'll hear from Ms. Comey on that in a second,\n25 I do have a question for you on it, and I need to read the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool32ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2oo of 264 l64l\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl against third parties. I think that's borne out by the\n\n2 substance of the document. Count One only talks about Jeffrey\n3 Epstein, the first defendant. Count Two only talks about Sarah\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, the second defendant. I think that that makes sense\n\n5 and it wouldn't be expected that Ghislaine Maxwell or anyone\n\n6 else would be included in allegations in a complaint against\n\n7 those two.\n\n8 More broadly, I think defense counsel has already\n\n9 goten the point that he wants to make across to the jury. He\nlo has made very, very clear, repeatedly, that this witness sued\nll Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> and not Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nl2 They have nou heard that she has filed multiple court documents\nl3 that are lengthy in which the defendant's name is not\n\nl4 mentioned. So he has everything he needs to make his\n\nl5 impeachment point. At this point, it's cumulative and risks\n\nl6 4o3 prejudice and confusion of the issues, and a sideshou about\nl7 a 2oo9 lawsuit to put in the document itself. He has\n\nl8 everything he needs.\n\nl9 THE COURT: I think that he has everything he needs\n2o goes to the relevance of the contention that the exclusion is\n2l there.\n22 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that the point is that\n23 she wasn't included as a defendant. I don't think that it\n24 would be expected, especially in a document --\n25 THE COURT: I think it's a redirect point, frankly,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool32l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2ol of 264 l642\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl counsel. And on a 4ol, 4o3, it is already in, it's a document.\n2 So it's really a cumulative argument. The point that you want\n3 to make, I presume you'll make on redirect. Since the point\n\n4 has already been made, I don't see that there is tremendous\n\na prejudice in including the document itself.\n\n6 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, my concern would be that these\n7 are crafted by lawyers in order to satisfy the elements of\n\n8 particular causes of action.\n\n9 THE COURT: Right.\n\nlo MS. COMEY: It will confuse the issues and it's not\n\nll writen in a narrative form and it wasn't offered by this\n\nl2 witness, and I think it would confuse the issues to start\n\nl3 puting these words in that her atorneys wrote. She did not\nl4 write this.\n\nl5 THE COURT: I think those are fine redirect points.\n\nl6 We've already established the 4ol of the omission, I don't\n\nl7 think it causes substantial 4o3 prejudice, and you're going to\nl8 make those redirect points in any event. So at least with\n\nl9 respect to this document C4, I'm going to overrule the\n2o objection.\nal Co, I think might be in a different position. I mean,\n22 2o6 says, expressly, <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> is one of defendant Epstein's\n23 employees, assistants referenced in paragraph l2. Epstein,\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, and others reached an agreement between themselves for\n25 the purposes of allouing defendant Epstein to commit the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool32l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l4 of 264 l655\nLC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross\n\nl THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.\n\n2 I think if it said the last incident, then fine. But\n3 otherwise you can ask the question. The paragraph itself is\n\n4 not inconsistent.\n\n5) What else?\n\n6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I'm offering 2o7 and 2o8 with\n\n7 regard to Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.\n\n8 THE COURT: 2o7.\n\n9 MR.

PAGLIUCA: Again, these are -- well, as to all of\nl2 these, I'll just make this argument as to all of the paragraphs\nl3 that the Court sustained. I view these as impeachment by\n\nl4 omission because Ms. Maxwell's name does not appear in any of\nl5 these paragraphs.\n\nl6 THE COURT: Right. So this is why this one is\n\nl7 different than the last document, which is because of paragraph\nl8 2o6 and paragraph l2, which expressly reference other unnamed\nl9 individual employees and assistants.

She did not sue\nlo Ghislaine. Ghislaine had not come up during that interview in\nll 2oo7. Ghislaine was not identified as anyone who recruited\n\nl2 Carolyn or groomed Carolyn or otherwise interacted with Carolyn\nl3 in Palm Beach. As I said, two suits by Carolyn, none involved\nl4 Ghislaine. You will see the length of the complaint against\n\nl5 Epstein and <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.

And after\n\nl8 Epstein died and there was money to be had, her lawyer\n\nl9 contacted the government, and nou her story included Ghislaine.\n2o And assisting the government enhanced her application to the\n2l fund, and she got three and a half million dollars, less the 4o\n22 or $5o,ooo that she had received in one of her lawsuits against\n23 Epstein and <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.\n24 Nou, early on, the judge told you that the burden is\n25 on the government to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 97 of lo6 llo\nLBTCMAX4 Visoski - direct\n\nl four or five desks that had prety much the accounting\n\n2 department and some of other Mr. Epstein's investment personnel\n3 that watched investments and such.

PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, there are two\n\n3 principals at play here.\n\n4 The first is this is what is commonly referred to as\n\n5 impeachment by omission, which is a subset of impeachment by\n\n6 contradiction. Impeachment by omission typically occurs where\n7 there is a document or a statement where the witness would\n\n8 likely include whatever is omited, and this is such a\n\n9 document, and I am seeking to impeach by omission through this\nlo document. This is a complaint against two people that this\n\nll witness claims sexually abused her. It's not only against\n\nl2 Epstein, it's against one of Epstein's employees who is\n\nl3 highlighted in this complaint. The entire testimony by the\n\nl4 government here through this witness has dounplayed the role of\nl5 Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> and up-played the role of Ghislaine Maxwell, and\nl6 it is an impeachment by omission that, in 2oo8, shortly after\nl7 being interviewed by the FBI about the same subject mater with\nl8 counsel, there is no mention of Maxwell in this entire\n\nl9 complaint. I think that is significant under the facts of this\n2o case. So, I think it is admissible under that theory and there\n2l is ample federal law, First Circuit, this circuit, that\n22 supports that theory of impeachment by omission. And these\n23 factual paragraphs, I believe, are also impeaching of the\n24 witness's testimony because it is inconsistent with the things\n25 that she has claimed happened to her in addition to these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8795", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l98 of 264 l639\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl things that are in the complaint.\n\n2 THE COURT: So that's a long way of geting to my --\n3 responding to my first question.\n\n4 MR.

PAGLIUCA: Yes.\n\nll THE COURT: So then on your second theory, can you\nl2 point to any inconsistency?\n\nl3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, these are all omissions, your\nl4 Honor, factual.

I understand your\n24 omission theory, I'll hear from Ms. Comey on that in a second,\n25 I do have a question for you on it, and I need to read the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8796", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2oo of 264 l64l\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl against third parties. I think that's borne out by the\n\n2 substance of the document. Count One only talks about Jeffrey\n3 Epstein, the first defendant. Count Two only talks about Sarah\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, the second defendant. I think that that makes sense\n\n5 and it wouldn't be expected that Ghislaine Maxwell or anyone\n\n6 else would be included in allegations in a complaint against\n\n7 those two.\n\n8 More broadly, I think defense counsel has already\n\n9 goten the point that he wants to make across to the jury. He\nlo has made very, very clear, repeatedly, that this witness sued\nll Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span> and not Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nl2 They have nou heard that she has filed multiple court documents\nl3 that are lengthy in which the defendant's name is not\n\nl4 mentioned. So he has everything he needs to make his\n\nl5 impeachment point. At this point, it's cumulative and risks\n\nl6 4o3 prejudice and confusion of the issues, and a sideshou about\nl7 a 2oo9 lawsuit to put in the document itself. He has\n\nl8 everything he needs.\n\nl9 THE COURT: I think that he has everything he needs\n2o goes to the relevance of the contention that the exclusion is\n2l there.\n22 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that the point is that\n23 she wasn't included as a defendant. I don't think that it\n24 would be expected, especially in a document --\n25 THE COURT: I think it's a redirect point, frankly,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 753 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2ol of 264 l642\nLC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross\n\nl counsel. And on a 4ol, 4o3, it is already in, it's a document.\n2 So it's really a cumulative argument. The point that you want\n3 to make, I presume you'll make on redirect. Since the point\n\n4 has already been made, I don't see that there is tremendous\n\na prejudice in including the document itself.\n\n6 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, my concern would be that these\n7 are crafted by lawyers in order to satisfy the elements of\n\n8 particular causes of action.\n\n9 THE COURT: Right.\n\nlo MS. COMEY: It will confuse the issues and it's not\n\nll writen in a narrative form and it wasn't offered by this\n\nl2 witness, and I think it would confuse the issues to start\n\nl3 puting these words in that her atorneys wrote. She did not\nl4 write this.\n\nl5 THE COURT: I think those are fine redirect points.\n\nl6 We've already established the 4ol of the omission, I don't\n\nl7 think it causes substantial 4o3 prejudice, and you're going to\nl8 make those redirect points in any event. So at least with\n\nl9 respect to this document C4, I'm going to overrule the\n2o objection.\nal Co, I think might be in a different position.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced fo collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions fo the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

The police wanted numerous |\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and |\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of |\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tumed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office handed doun one indictment of |\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-E] (cirea the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . zy\nfounder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half my —o |\nsources on the island are Jewish socialites.” (\\Q .. i—=> No ot CaP ane Bor fe yoeslee\nLambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have touho\ndo time. William Kennedy Smith in l99l, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction. 7 Ss\nMaybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big ap hd\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrae] supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu v\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (leak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer ate in :\nregard to the l4-year-old, ho wv «A a> WHA b\nOf course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from Je Wi A\nEdgar Allan Poe’s psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth’s sociological comedies. Epstein is —\nlicensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shouer on the first floor was\ngiven over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had\na Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as Island Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhte eho orinthia.clickshilitv com/nt/entTackeieonee lle= Thet Rantseier EUG Recida Rewes!

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

The police wanted numerous\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah <span class=\"highlight\">Kellen</span>.

There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach.

I explained to her that she was not in\nany trouble houever as part of this investigation, I needed to ask\ncertain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein\nwould ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her to\nrub his nipples as he masturbated himself. Sjoberg stated she felt\n\"grossed\" about the behavior but as she was geting paid, she just\ncontinued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the\nMassages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the\nvibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages.\nSjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he\nmaintained himself covered under the touel he would be wearing. When\nEpstein would masturbate he would be covered.\nI asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from\nEpstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised\nEpstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College.\nShe received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke doun.\nAdditionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also\nrecommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Rou in Palm\nBeach. The client she was referred to was \"Glenn\" unknoun last name,\nand his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was\nconcluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach\nPolice Department.\nWhile at the police station, I researched Florida tag X88-EFF which\nwas also previously seen on the property when there was physical\nsurveillance being done at the property.

The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N9ooLS registration,\nwas on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently\nacquired the services of a new atorney, and the fact that Epstein's\nhouse is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may\nbe in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,\n358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting\nremodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed\ndriving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida\nregistration of F3oQoF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north\non County Road.
