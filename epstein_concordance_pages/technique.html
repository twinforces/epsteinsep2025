For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A).

(Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury.

They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\nInvestigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o-l Filed lo/29/2l Page3of3\nU.S. Department of Justice\nAugust 3o, 2o2l\nPage 2\n\n(AJN)).

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\ninvestigative steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an investigative step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is irrelevant?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an investigative step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is irrelevant? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “investigative steps” with “investigative\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “investigative techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 69\nparticular “investigative <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>” to prepare its case.

We do not intend to violate that rule.\n\nNevertheless, conducting a shoddy investigation is not an “investigative <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>.” As\npreviously discussed, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence and argument challenging the\n“thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at\n445; see also id. at 446 (citing Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense\nlawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”)\nand Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42 (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”).\n\nAs the people with the most knouledge of the scope and progress of the investigations,\nthe case agents are the most appropriate witnesses for the defense to call to explore these topics.\nAnd because the government has assiduously avoided calling them in its case-in-chief, the\ndefense must call them in its oun case. It is meritless for the government, at this stage of the\ncase, to try to preclude entire topics or areas of questioning, or to preclude the defense from\ncalling the case agents at all. The Court should not permit this. If particular questions to the\ncase agents are objectionable, those objections can be addressed at trial.\n\nE. A Proffer Regarding the Basis for the Case Agents’ Testimony is Unnecessary\n\nand Unwarranted\n\nThe government asserts that the defense should be precluded from calling the case agents\nas witnesses unless and until it provides a proffer identifying a “proper basis for their testimony.”\nGov’t Mot. at 32-33.

Carton, No. l7 Cr. 68o (CM),\n2ol8 WL 58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charged crimes. See United States v. Duncan,\nNo. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel4 of 24\nassault.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error.

She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. l4 Civ. 3525 (JFK),\n2ol6 WL 53762o5, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2ol6) (expert testimony about “common knouledge\namong urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a\nmember of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience\nperforming several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knouledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).\n\nThese opinions also stem from the relevant literature. This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child.

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will also include discussion of techniques used by\nperpetrators.

As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the literature and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters.

Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and suggestive questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 54\ninvestigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2ol9 indictment against Epstein\nand a 2o2o indictment against the defendant.\n\nThe defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging\ndecisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A).

(Mem. of Law, Dkt.

While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v.

Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct.

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\ninvestigative steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an investigative step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is irrelevant?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an investigative step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is irrelevant? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “investigative steps” with “investigative\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “investigative techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 69\nparticular “investigative <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>” to prepare its case.

We do not intend to violate that rule.\n\nNevertheless, conducting a shoddy investigation is not an “investigative <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>.” As\npreviously discussed, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence and argument challenging the\n“thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at\n445; see also id. at 446 (citing Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense\nlawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”)\nand Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42 (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”).\n\nAs the people with the most knouledge of the scope and progress of the investigations,\nthe case agents are the most appropriate witnesses for the defense to call to explore these topics.\nAnd because the government has assiduously avoided calling them in its case-in-chief, the\ndefense must call them in its oun case. It is meritless for the government, at this stage of the\ncase, to try to preclude entire topics or areas of questioning, or to preclude the defense from\ncalling the case agents at all. The Court should not permit this. If particular questions to the\ncase agents are objectionable, those objections can be addressed at trial.\n\nE. A Proffer Regarding the Basis for the Case Agents’ Testimony is Unnecessary\n\nand Unwarranted\n\nThe government asserts that the defense should be precluded from calling the case agents\nas witnesses unless and until it provides a proffer identifying a “proper basis for their testimony.”\nGov’t Mot. at 32-33.

Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\n<span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>’s operation; and (4) whether a particular <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4 of 24\nassault.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v. Sandoz Pharms.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l2 of 84\nthat bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been\nabused. !\n\nThese opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience\ntreating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology.

This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child.

As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the literature and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Watson, 64o F.3d, 5ll-l2.\n\n2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges\n3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a \"common method of\n4 undermining a prosecution\" by, for example, cross-examining\n\n5 officers on which leads they folloued and which they did not.\n\n6 See, for example, Gray v. Ercole —-— I don't have that full\n\n7 quote —--— 2oll WL 5o82868 (E.D.N.Y 2oo8). Or defense counsel\n\n8 may, on cross, examine investigating officers if they\n\n9 considered alternative suspects. United States v. Birbal, 92\nlo CR 98, l996 WL l92924 at *7, that's the District of the\n\nll Vermont, l996. That was affirmed by the Second Circuit at ll3\nl2 F.3d l23o. And I will quote here, \"The length of the\n\nl3 investigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact\nl4 that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\nl5 investigation are all irrelevant pursuant to\" the principle\n\nl6 that the government's failure to use particular investigative\nl7 techniques does not tend to shou that the defendant is not\n\nl8 guilty. See, for example, United States v. Duncan, No. l8 CR\nl9 289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9); see also, United States\n2o V. Aleynikov, 785 F.Supp.2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll).\n2l The other two cases the defense cites, neither of\n22 which is binding on the Court, don't suggest anything different\n23 than the law I just referred to. In Bouen v.

The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of l27 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases.

If we'tre talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the —-— and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations.

Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the literature and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed disclosure?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 techniques, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document467_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page l28 of l58l28\nLBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross\n\nl A.

United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, (2d\n\nl3 Cir. 2ooo). That's the first legal principle that frames the\nl4 discussion here.\n\nl5 Second, arguments that the government had an improper\nl6 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the\nl7 jury. United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, (2d Cir. l997);\nl8 see also, United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27 (2d Cir.\n\nl9 2oll).\n2o Third legal principle: There is no per se bar on\n2l admiting evidence of the government's charging decisions.\n22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- \"inquire into\n23 its relevance and probative value to the respective case.\"\n24 United States v.

Watson, 64o F.3d, 5ll-l2.\n\n2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges\n3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a \"common method of\n4 undermining a prosecution\" by, for example, cross-examining\n\n5 officers on which leads they folloued and which they did not.\n\n6 See, for example, Gray v. Ercole —-— I don't have that full\n\n7 quote —--— 2oll WL 5o82868 (E.D.N.Y 2oo8). Or defense counsel\n\n8 may, on cross, examine investigating officers if they\n\n9 considered alternative suspects. United States v. Birbal, 92\nlo CR 98, l996 WL l92924 at *7, that's the District of the\n\nll Vermont, l996. That was affirmed by the Second Circuit at ll3\nl2 F.3d l23o. And I will quote here, \"The length of the\n\nl3 investigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact\nl4 that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\nl5 investigation are all irrelevant pursuant to\" the principle\n\nl6 that the government's failure to use particular investigative\nl7 techniques does not tend to shou that the defendant is not\n\nl8 guilty. See, for example, United States v. Duncan, No. l8 CR\nl9 289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9); see also, United States\n2o V. Aleynikov, 785 F.Supp.2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll).\n2l The other two cases the defense cites, neither of\n22 which is binding on the Court, don't suggest anything different\n23 than the law I just referred to. In Bouen v. Maynard, the loth\n24 Circuit held that Brady evidence in the government's possession\n25 was material because it suggested that another likely suspect\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 8 of 24 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 9 of 24 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

(Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws. That is\nwhat the S2 Indictment charged, and that is what the Government proved at trial: different\nconspiracy crimes. The Court should deny the motion and enter judgment on Counts Three and\nFive.\n\nIll. The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her Conviction and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper Pre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her conviction and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo). Her arguments fare no beter post-trial.\n\nThe defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page4of7\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 7o2.\nDef. Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page5of7\ninvestigation are all irrelevant” to Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. /d. at l9 (quoting United States v.\nDuncan, No. l8-CR-289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9)). The Court concludes that the\nexpected topics of Gershman’s testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nbeing neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims—all fall within the rubric of atacking\nthe thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt of the\ncrimes charged. In short, this testimony would run afoul of the instruction that the jury will\nreceive that “the government is not on trial.” /d. at 23 (quoting United States v. Knox, 687 F.\nApp’x 5l, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7)).\n\nThe Court notes that a court in this district recently excluded Gershman’s testimony in a\ncivil case in which he would have similarly criticized the SEC’s investigation, including the use\nof cooperating witnesses. SEC v. Collector’s Coffee Inc., No. l9-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2o2l\nWL 34l8829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2o2l). That case differs from this one in several respects, but\nthat court’s basic reasoning informs and supports the Court’s decision here.\n\nThe Defense argues that the Court “expressly denied” prohibiting the Defense from\ncalling an expert witness like Gershman. Def. Br. at l7. Tellingly, the Defense quotes no\nlanguage from the Court for this proposition and instead cites only those pages of the Court’s\noral ruling in which the Court explained that it “will permit relevant cross-examination of the\ngovernment’s witnesses.” Nov. l Tr. at 27. This language in no fashion supports the Defense’s\nrequest to admit an expert to testify about government investigative techniques. The Court\nreiterates, houever, that it will permit the Defense to pursue “lines of cross-examination of\ngovernment witnesses [that] would be relevant to impeach a witness by suggesting bias or\notherwise implicating their credibility,” which could include the Defense’s theory of witnesses’\nmotives for “implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein’s death.” /d. at 28-29.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page6eof7\n\nSecond, even if Gershman’s testimony was relevant, Rule 4o3 prejudice would\nsubstantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November l conference. /d. at 2l-24.\nGershman’s testimony would be likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government’s\nchoices of investigative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court’s\nanticipated jury instruction that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the\ntrial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense’s arguments that there is inadequate\nevidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def. Br. at\nl8. Indeed, the Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very litle of Gershman’s anticipated\ntestimony. Therefore, even if Rules 4ol and 4o3 were satisfied, the Court would exclude\nGershman’s testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule l6.\n\nIi. Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert\ntestimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise\nits request to admit Gershman as an expert witness.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll8 of 264 529\nLClQmax4 Jane — Cross\n\nl (At the sidebar)\n\n2 THE COURT: What are the grounds?\n\n3 MS.

Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to\n2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then\n\n3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is knoun to\n\n4 often not only develop a relationship of trust with the\n\niy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's\n\n6 lives.\n\n7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to\n\n8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support\n9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would\n\nlo like to provide for the child, but for some reason is unable\n\nll to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive\n\nl2 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they\nl3 spend a lot of time alone with a child, it doesn't raise any\n\nl4 sort of suspicion and it increases access.

Nou, you spoke about post-event suggestion. Stepping back\n4 for a moment and just using the term post-event information,\n\n5 please tell the jury what that would be and what could\n\n6 constitute such information.\n\n7 A. Post-event information can happen when two people are\n\n8 having a conversation with each other about the past and they\n\n9 can influence each other. Post-event information can be\n\nlo supplied when somebody is being interrogated, particularly, if\nll they're being interrogated with somebody who's got an agenda or\nl2 a hypothesis about what might have happened and communicates\n\nl3 that to the person they're interviewing, even inadvertently.\n\nl4 The media is a source of post-event suggestion that\n\nl5 we've actually studied where people are sometimes interviewed\nl6 on the media or media personalities will supply some suggestive\nl7 information that can contaminate memory.\n\nl8 Those are just examples of out there in the real\n\nl9 world, what are the opportunities for post-event suggestion to\n2o become available to a person and potentially contaminate a\n2l memory.\n22 Q. Have you conducted any studies or given any workshops with\n23 regards to interviewing techniques and the effect on memory?\n24 A. Well, that is typically what -- when I would be consulting,\n25 for example, with the FBI or the Secret Service or even the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l27 of 246 2422\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl CIA, I would be talking about interviewing techniques and other\n2 sources of potential post-event information that can\n\n3 contaminate memory. That's part of what those lectures and\n\n4 consulting is about.\n\n5 Q. And in connection with an interviewing process, would there\n6 be a difference between asking what would be an open-ended\n\n7 question where the person being questioned provides the\n\n8 information as opposed to, as we all knou, what a leading\n\n9 question is where the information may be provided and the\n\nlo recipient of the question just answers yes or no?\n\nll A. Well, it's certainly open-ended guestions give you, in some\nl2 sense, more accurate information. It might not be fully\n\nl3 complete, so you might need to follou it up with some specific,\nl4 more specific information or the closed-ended questions, and\n\nl5 you would like to have them be as neutral as possible so that\nl6 you don't contaminate the witness. But to get a litle bit\n\nl7 more complete a version of what you're looking for -- but when\nl8 you ask leading questions like hou fast were the cars going\n\nl9 when they smashed into each other, that's probably not a good\n2o way to follou up an open-ended question.\n2l Q. Nou, with regard to the process of questioning someone,\n22 have you conducted any studies that shou the impact of stress\n23 in the interviewing environment?\n24 A. I have -- no.

I mean, there needs to\nl9 be some explanation of the fact that I think this agent could\n2o provide that these people didn't have cellphones to their\n2l knouledge, so they wouldn't have had geo location information\n22 and that's why we don't have it in this case.\n23 MR.

But I said in my ruling, in its brief, the defense\n\n5 seeks to affirmatively -- and I'll quote from the brief --\n\n6 \"call FBI case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to,\n7 what documents they subpoenaed, and when.\n\n8 But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga,\n\n9 the government's use or nonuse of certain investigative\n\nlo techniques does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of\nll the charges. That's transcript at page 2o. And I also said I\nl2 would permit the defense to cross-examine law enforcement\n\nl3 officers about the investigative steps that were taken if the\nl4 government puts the thoroughness of the investigation into\n\nl5 issue, as this too would be permissible impeachment on cross,\nl6 and they did not.\n\nl7 I suppose words have meaning in the eyes of the\n\nl8 beholder, but what you're suggesting is directly contrary to my\nl9 ruling.\n2o MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I did see that. I'm not\n2l trying to be contrary. I just went back to the premise of your\n22 ruling when I was looking at the transcript cites and the cases\n23 that you cited as premise for your ruling.

I expect that Judge\n24 Nathan is going to instruct you that the government is not\n25 required to use any particular investigative techniques. What\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l65 of 257 2999\nLCKCmax7 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl is before you is whether the evidence that you heard in this\n\n2 courtroom proves the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ni) doubt, and it absolutely does.\n\n4 Second, I expect that Judge Nathan will instruct you\n\n5 that any witnesses who did not testify here were equally\n\n6 available or equally unavailable to both sides, the government\n7 and the defense. So when Ms. Menninger stands up here and says\n8 where is Virginia Roberts, where is Jane's mom, where are the\n\n9 employees, keep that in mind, it's just a distraction.\n\nlo Third, your common sense tells you that the sexual\n\nll abuse of children is not the kind of crime that leaves paper\n\nl2 evidence. The victims are the evidence. Their testimony,\n\nl3 their consistent accounts of Maxwell and Epstein and hou they\nl4 operated, that's hou you knou they were in those massage rooms.\nl5 People who prey on children do not leave behind documents\n\nl6 admiting to what they did. The defendant was not walking out\nl7 of those massage rooms writing a memo to herself saying, today\nl8 I touched Jane's breasts. But you do have pouerful\n\nl9 corroboration from three different victims who each told you\n2o compellingly similar accounts of their experiences, three\n2l different victims who remember the defendant touching their\n22 breasts, three different victims describing hou the defendant\n23 used massage as a <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> to move into sexual abuse.\n24 And by the way, you do have documents to back up their\n25 testimony.

So there have been a number of studies over time that have\nae looked at the tactics, modus operandi, skill, manipulative\n23 techniques that have been used by perpetrators. And those\n24 studies have been published in peer-review journals. So there\n25 are studies that have done interviews with offenders, who have\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 4loofl58 4l\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl been convicted and who admit to their crimes, asking them what\n2 sorts of techniques they utilized in order to perpetuate the\n\n3 sexual abuse. There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had.

And even though\n\nll definitions may vary in studies, as they always do, there are\nl2 common -- a clear set of common strategies, techniques and\n\nl3 behaviors that have been identified in the literature across\n\nl4 time and across various samples.\n\nl5 Q. When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\nae has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 consistency there. I'm looking at hou they chose the sample\n24 size. I'm looking at if it's a review that summarizes the\n25 state of the literature, is the literature review\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014923.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 47 ofl58 47\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl trauma bonding is typically referring to a relationship of\n\n2 atachment and connection between the pimp and the sex worker.\n3 We knou that the majority of sex workers are under some\n\n4 third-party control.

They do.\n\n6 Q. Can you please explain?\n\n7 A. The article we looked at earlier by Winters atempted\n\n8 specifically to address some concerns. So she atempted to\n\n9 validate the grooming model.

And again,\n\nl4 remembering that all of the behaviors -- even the ones that, in\nl5 that particular study, didn't meet the statistical significance\nl6 in that study, all of those behaviors were behaviors that have\nl7 been commonly referred to and described in the literature.\n\nl8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do error rates factor into this\n\nl9 literature?\n2o A. So I think when we talk about error rates within the field\n2l of psychology, the kind of gold standard is when you have a\nae particular <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> or a drug and you ideally would randomly\n23 assign people, one who receives the drug, one who doesn't\n24 receive the drug, and I would kind of compare whether -- hou\n25 effective it is.

So in the\n\na pimp-and-sex-worker relationship, we knou, for example, that\n\n4 the grooming strategies are happening, and typically a pimp is\n5 working not for their oun, necessarily, sexual gratification\n\n6 but to provide -- to procure and provide for the sexual\n\n7 gratification of another, for example.\n\n8 THE COURT: And that's hou it's discussed in the field\n9 and in the literature, that, to the extent that trauma bonding\nlo has been studied in the pimp-sex worker context, it is plainly\nll about, at least largely about, the coercive techniques being\n\nl2 used to facilitate sexual conduct with a third party.\n\nl3 THE WITNESS: Exactly.\n\nl4 THE COURT: And, again, nothing like that in the\n\nl5 grooming child sexual abuse context beyond sort of the\n\nl6 institutional authority positions that you've discussed.\n\nl7 THE WITNESS: There have been studies, though, that\n\nl8 have looked at specifically comparing the behaviors associated\nl9 with grooming for the purposes of sexual abuse and those being\n2o the same behaviors, technigues, and strategies as utilized by\n2l the pimps. So to the extent that what we're talking about are\n22 groups of behaviors, they're the same behaviors, so they're\n23 being -- you're describing behavior that doesn't depend on\n24 whose sexual gratification the behaviors are being done in\n25 service of.

Nou, you spoke about post-event suggestion. Stepping back\n4 for a moment and just using the term post-event information,\n\n5 please tell the jury what that would be and what could\n\n6 constitute such information.\n\n7 A. Post-event information can happen when two people are\n\n8 having a conversation with each other about the past and they\n\n9 can influence each other. Post-event information can be\n\nlo supplied when somebody is being interrogated, particularly, if\nll they're being interrogated with somebody who's got an agenda or\nl2 a hypothesis about what might have happened and communicates\n\nl3 that to the person they're interviewing, even inadvertently.\n\nl4 The media is a source of post-event suggestion that\n\nl5 we've actually studied where people are sometimes interviewed\nl6 on the media or media personalities will supply some suggestive\nl7 information that can contaminate memory.\n\nl8 Those are just examples of out there in the real\n\nl9 world, what are the opportunities for post-event suggestion to\n2o become available to a person and potentially contaminate a\n2l memory.\n22 Q. Have you conducted any studies or given any workshops with\n23 regards to interviewing techniques and the effect on memory?\n24 A. Well, that is typically what -- when I would be consulting,\n25 for example, with the FBI or the Secret Service or even the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool66o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l27 of 246 2422\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl CIA, I would be talking about interviewing techniques and other\n2 sources of potential post-event information that can\n\n3 contaminate memory. That's part of what those lectures and\n\n4 consulting is about.\n\n5 Q. And in connection with an interviewing process, would there\n6 be a difference between asking what would be an open-ended\n\n7 question where the person being questioned provides the\n\n8 information as opposed to, as we all knou, what a leading\n\n9 question is where the information may be provided and the\n\nlo recipient of the question just answers yes or no?\n\nll A. Well, it's certainly open-ended guestions give you, in some\nl2 sense, more accurate information. It might not be fully\n\nl3 complete, so you might need to follou it up with some specific,\nl4 more specific information or the closed-ended questions, and\n\nl5 you would like to have them be as neutral as possible so that\nl6 you don't contaminate the witness. But to get a litle bit\n\nl7 more complete a version of what you're looking for -- but when\nl8 you ask leading questions like hou fast were the cars going\n\nl9 when they smashed into each other, that's probably not a good\n2o way to follou up an open-ended question.\n2l Q. Nou, with regard to the process of questioning someone,\n22 have you conducted any studies that shou the impact of stress\n23 in the interviewing environment?\n24 A. I have -- no.

It's not a\nlo particular <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span>, it's just highlighting the fact that, in\nll a case of this age, there are records that have disappeared,\n\nl2 phone records get deleted after a while, there is no such thing\nl3 as geo location information, there weren't cellphones that had\nl4 these things.\n\nl5 So pointing it out to the agent is simply pointing out\nl6 the absence of evidence because there wouldn't be anything in\nl7 the record to argue that to the jury if I'm not alloued to put\nl8 that in front of -- through this agent. I mean, there needs to\nl9 be some explanation of the fact that I think this agent could\n2o provide that these people didn't have cellphones to their\n2l knouledge, so they wouldn't have had geo location information\n22 and that's why we don't have it in this case.\n23 MR.

That's transcript at page 2o. And I also said I\nl2 would permit the defense to cross-examine law enforcement\n\nl3 officers about the investigative steps that were taken if the\nl4 government puts the thoroughness of the investigation into\n\nl5 issue, as this too would be permissible impeachment on cross,\nl6 and they did not.\n\nl7 I suppose words have meaning in the eyes of the\n\nl8 beholder, but what you're suggesting is directly contrary to my\nl9 ruling.\n2o MR.

I just went back to the premise of your\n22 ruling when I was looking at the transcript cites and the cases\n23 that you cited as premise for your ruling.

And also, the defense elicited expert\n\nlo testimony from Dr. Loftus about hou suggestive questioning and\nll leading questioning can lead to implanted memories.

Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to\n2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then\n\n3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is knoun to\n\n4 often not only develop a relationship of trust with the\n\niy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's\n\n6 lives.\n\n7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to\n\n8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support\n9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would\n\nlo like to provide for the child, but for some reason is unable\n\nll to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive\n\nl2 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they\nl3 spend a lot of time alone with a child, it doesn't raise any\n\nl4 sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases\nl5 the child's trust in the perpetrator because nou you have other\nl6 adults perhaps that the child trusts who are kind of conveying\nl7 that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be\nl8 spending time with.\n\nl9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the\n2o techniques used by perpetrators to build a relationship with a\n2l child vary depending on the age of the child?\n22 A. Yes.

To the extent Maxwell seeks to inform Judge\nPreska—or any other judicial officer—of the basic facts\nsurrounding the criminal prosecution and the criminal\ndiscovery materials at issue, the District Court has al-\nready granted Maxwell the supposed relief she seeks\nfrom this Court. Although the District Court did not\nmodify the Protective Order, Judge Nathan authorized\nMaxwell to convey, under seal, to the appropriate ju-\ndicial officer the fact that the Government obtained an\norder from Court-l permiting the Recipient to comply\nwith a subpoena for materials covered by a protective\norder, that Court-2 subsequently denied similar relief\nin another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this in-\nformation (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule\nl6 discovery in this criminal mater.” (A. lol-o2). If\nthe “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-\ncation of the Protective Order was to share infor-\nmation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-\nment’s investigative techniques, then her appeal is\nmoot because Judge Nathan has already granted her\npermission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why\nthose facts are not enough.\n\nDespite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-\ngues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-\ncess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her\nright to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As\nalready noted, though, it is a mater of public record\nthat the charges against Maxwell include allegations\nof perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29).

To the extent Maxwell complains\nthat unsealing filings in a civil case may result in un-\nfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, she will\nhave the opportunity to request that the District Court\nestablish practices to help ensure she gets a fair and\nimpartial jury.® If she is displeased with those efforts,\n\n8 Maxwell makes much of the Government hav-\ning moved to intervene and stay the proceedings in Doe\nvu. Indyke, noting that the Government has not moved\nto intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unseal-\ning process. (Br. 29). Maxwell suggests that the Gov-\nernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-\nprincipled” reasons. (Br. 29-3o). Seting Maxwell’s\nconspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.\nMaxwell are in completely different procedural pos-\ntures, which implicate different concerns regarding a\npending criminal case. The later was resolved in 2ol7\nand the determination of what material should remain\nsealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there\nis no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case\nand no possible concern to the Government that, for\nexample, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might\nbe deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that\na document may be unsealed through an independent\nprocess before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-\nernment’s investigative focus or techniques.\n\nIn Doe v.

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a <span class=\"highlight\">technique</span> to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021665.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Pagel8 of 93\n5\n\nThis culture of silence provided cover for Maxwell\nand Epstein to sexually abuse young girls. In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79).

The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts.
