I defined the\npopulation in the census tract as U.S. citizens of voting age. To estimate the percent Hispanic, I\nused the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) method, which enhances the accuracy\nof the geocoding by also using information about the ethnicity of a person’s last name. This\nmethod has been shoun to significantly improve the estimation for Hispanics. !°\n\n27. There is one constraint on the accuracy of the geocoding methodology. The basic\nassumption is that if the potential voting eligible population (U.S. citizens of voting age) ina\ncensus tract is 85% African American, then we would expect 85% of those on the master jury\nwheel who reside in that census tract to be African American. Houever, since the master jury\nwheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this\nassumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract\nis the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to\nregister to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans\nand Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason l). Houever, there is no valid statistical\nevidence to conclude there is such a difference.\"!\n\n28. Based on the geocoding, the race and ethnicity representation of the master jury\nwheel is ll.2o% African American and l2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the master jury wheel is l.25\n‘o For additional information on BISG, see Elliot, M.N., Morrison, P.A., et al. “Using the\nCensus Bureau’s Surname List to Improve Estimates of Race/Ethnicity and Associated\nDisparities” in Health Serv Outcomes Res Method 9:69-83 (2oo9).\n\n'! The only data available on citizens registering to vote by race and ethnicity is published by the\nU.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey November 2ol6, and it shous the rates across\nthe state, not within the same census tract. The difference in rates of registering by race and\nethnicity <span class=\"highlight\">statewide</span> would be expected to be greater than within census tracts. The data for\nNovember 2ol6 shous African American citizens more likely to register by l percentage point,\nand Hispanic citizens less likely to register by 7.2 percentage points.

A sexual offender who reports his or her intent to reside in\nanother state or jurisdiction but who remains in this state without reporting to the sheriff in |\nthe manner required by this subsection commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as |\nprovided in s. 775.o82, s. 775.o83, or s. 775,o84. |\n(9)(a) Asexual offender who does not comply with the requirements of this section commits a |\nfelony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.o82, s. 775.o83, or s. 775.o84, |\n(b) Asexual offender who commits any act or omission in violation of this section may be |\nprosecuted for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was commited, |\nthe county of the last registered address of the sexual offender, or the county in which the |\nconviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person |\nas a sexual offander. |\n{c) An arrest on charges of failure to register when the offender has been provided and advised |\nof his or her statutory obligations to register under subsection (2), the service of an |\ninformation or a complaint for a violation of this section, or an arraignment on charges for a\nviolation of this section constitutes actual notice of the duty to register.
