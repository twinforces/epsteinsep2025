SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000886.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagelo of 25\ndefense counsel's leter, filed July 27, 2o2o Document filed by USA.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000914.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page4 of 3l\n\nThese conditions would support a complaint for cruel and unusual\npunishment for a convicted felon. Ms. Maxwell is not one. She is\ninnocent unless and until she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable\ndoubt — an event which is highly unlikely given the lack of evidence\nagainst her.\n\nDespite the district court’s exhortations regarding the strength of\nthe evidence against Ms. Maxwell, the truth is that the government’s\nso-called “evidence,” though voluminous, is palpably weak. It consists\nof anonymous, untested hearsay <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> about events that are\nalleged to have occurred decades ago, <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> which only surfaced\nwhen the government faced public outrage over the inexplicable death\nof Jeffrey Epstein, while in their custody.\n\nThe “Epstein Effect” clouded the judgment of the prosecutors into\ncharging Ms. Maxwell because it needed a scapegoat, the Bureau of\nPrisons into puting Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch because Epstein died\non their watch, the media into an absolute frenzy, and many other fair-\nminded people into viewing Ms. Maxwell as guilty even though no\nevidence has been presented against her.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo9l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000916.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page6 of 3l\nISSUES PRESENTED\n\nl.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

Trust us when\nwe say her conditions are fine because the Bureau of Prisons says they are\nfine (and we can’t have another Jeffrey Epstein situation).

As much as the Government would like this case to be the\nJeffrey Epstein shou, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMs. Maxwell understands that she and the Government are not\ngoing to agree on the facts.

It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes.

The remaining <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 2 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 2 of 3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt.

Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2o2o WL l49588o, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001764.jpg": "The Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nits outside vendor to image, stamp, and dounload that electronic discovery, which the Government\nfinished preparing for production last week, from an electronic database. The volume of that\nproduction is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that\nthe vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the\nGovernment has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2o2o deadline, and the vendor\nis making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next\nweek and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional\ntime beyond November 9 to finalize this production. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the\nGovernment has made numerous productions consistent with the discovery schedule in this case\nand is working diligently to continue to meet the discovery deadlines in this case.\n\nWith respect to the defense’s other claims and <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, the Government is prepared to\nrespond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> about\nthe Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally incorrect, but\nalso include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to\nreach agreement with the Government “[f]ollouing the close of discovery,” which has not yet\noccurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2o2o, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless\natempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule l6 discovery, or on a faulty\ndefinition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. l3, 2o2o,\nDtk. No. 4l, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of production of witness list until shortly before\ntrial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule l6 does not require\nproduction of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65, at l-2\n(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a\ndefendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the\nGovernment)).”\n\nWith respect to the Government’s October 7 leter regarding other agency files, the\ndefense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who\nit believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the\nGovernment has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more\nGovernment may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,\nthe Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.\n\n? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense nou contends that evidence\nabout the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Atorney’s Office\nfor the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense\nmakes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that\nagreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged\nin this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense\nnevertheless believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those\narguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.\n\n> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding\nany concerns about the Government’s October 7 leter or the Government’s planned productions\nprior to filing the Defense Leter with the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4of5\n\n| can atest oi calmness and courage and focus and consistency in immediately stating why\neach allegation that comes up, was/is not true and why.

She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun opposition to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> against her starting earlier.

R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l6\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nStrike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring to cause individuals to travel in\ninterstate or foreign commerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the indictment contains no\nallegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled.’ Moreover, throughout the period alleged in the\nindictment, Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged conduct\nas to her took place. Therefore, the Court should strike all allegations regarding Accuser-3 from\nthe indictment, as they are nothing more than a transparent atempt by the government to\nintroduce Accuser-3’s testimony as evidence of a conspiracy, when it is at most “other acts”\nevidence subject to the balancing test required by Fed.

The substantive Mann\nAct counts involve Ms. Maxwell’s alleged enticement and/or transportation of Accuser-l.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell engaged in group sexual encounters with\nJeffrey Epstein and Accuser-l and that, on at least one occasion, Ms. Maxwell enticed or caused\nAccuser-l to travel from Florida to New York for the purpose of engaging in such encounters\nwith Epstein.

But the allegations as to Accuser-3 cannot possibly support the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell: Although the gravamen of a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense is enticing or causing an\nindividual to travel, there is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled—let alone that Ms.\nMaxwell (or Epstein, for that mater) enticed her to do so or transported her. Moreover, although\nboth § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) require an intent that the traveling individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity, the indictment alleges no facts suggesting that Epstein’s alleged sexual activity\nwith Accuser-3, who was over the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times, was\nunlawful. As a result, these allegations serve only to demonstrate a propensity on the part of Ms.\nMaxwell that will prejudice the jury against her.\n\nTo enable the presentation of evidence regarding Accuser-3, the government claims the\nalleged “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 is somehou an “overt act” in furtherance of conspiracies to\ncause unspecified individuals to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\nThe government’s inclusion of these allegations, houever, is nothing more than an atempted\nend-run around its obligations under Fed.

As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v.

And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation.

The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression.

Discussion\n\nIn an alternative effort to suppress the materials obtained pursuant to the subpoena, the\ndefendant argues that an evidentiary hearing is warranted to inquire into the Government’s\n“misrepresentations” to Chief Judge McMahon. (Def. Mot. 3 at l6). Houever, as discussed\nextensively above, Maxwell’s motion is litle more than speculation and innuendo, itself rooted in\na lone news article that, as described above, is not fully accurate. She otherwise presents no\nadmissible evidence, affidavits, or other materials supporting the breathless <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> contained\nin her motion papers. As such, because the defendant does not include “an affidavit of someone\nwith personal knouledge of the underlying facts,” Shaw, 26o F. Supp. 2d at 57o, and because the\n\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 239\n\nis the “specification of what statements are alleged to be false, and in what respect they are false,\nin charges of criminal falsity,” as well as “the subject mater of the congressional inquiry” for\ncharges of “refusal to answer questions in a congressional inquiry.” Jd. at l25-26 (citing, inter\nalia, Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749 (l962)). Similarly, “where an indictment charges a\ncrime that depends in turn on violation of another statute, the indictment must identify the\nunderlying offense.” United States v. Pirro, 2l2 F.3d 86, 93 (2d Cir. 2ooo). When delineating the\ncontours of this narrou category of crimes requiring additional specificity in an indictment, the\nSecond Circuit has previously found that the failure to name a specific victim of fraud does not\nrender an indictment inadequate under this standard. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l27. In other words,\nabsent some affirmative indication that additional specificity is required when charging a particular\nstatute, there is no basis to conclude that an indictment need contain more than the elements of the\noffense and the approximate time and place of the alleged violation. See Wey, 2ol7 WL 23765l\nat *5 (declining to “depart from the usual sufficiency framework” where defendant “cites no\nauthority” suggesting that the statutes at issue fall into the narrou exception to the general rule\nwhen considering motion to dismiss for lack of specificity).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBecause each of the four counts at issue—Counts One, Two, Three, and Four—clearly lays\nout each element of the charged offense and adequately informs the defendant of the <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>\nagainst her, the Indictment easily satisfies the standard for sufficiency. Tellingly, the defendant\ndoes not claim that any of these counts fails to allege an essential element or to track the language\nof the relevant statute. Nor could she, as the face of the Indictment not only contains each and\nevery essential element of the crimes charged, but also goes beyond the basic requirements for\npleading each charge by providing additional factual background.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA.

These date ranges are well within the boundaries\npermited by the Second Circuit and other federal courts, and have been supplemented with\nadditional details provided by the Government.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid <span class=\"highlight\">Accusations</span>,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafana of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 292 of 349\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA.

EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIOR CHARGING DECISIONS AND\n\nTHE COURSE OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS IS ADMISSIBLE\n\n“The right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is\na fundamental constitutional right secured by both the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s\noun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo549l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005847.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\ndiscovery rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> of seductive or vindictive young people. . ..

We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\n\nThe government makes many unfounded <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> including that the timely\ndisclosure of potential experts is “gamesmanship.” The simple truth here is that avoiding\na direct conferral about a straightforward task such as selecting one of three dates while\ndrafting a three-page rant a few hours before the filing deadline is not mere gamesmanship,\nit is unprofessional gamesmanship. A few observations are in order:\n\nFirst, the reason we are required to hold a Daubert hearing in this case is that the\ngovernment endorsed an expert to talk about subjects that are not widely accepted by\nqualified experts in the field. She has no methodology or studies that support her theories,\nand most of her opinions will be confusing, not help the jury, and do not fit the facts of this\ncase,\n\nSecond, at the government’s request and over the objection of the defense, the Court\naccelerated the Rule 4l2 notice requirement. The defense did not atempt to game this\ndeadline by, for example, complaining about various deficiencies in the delayed roll out of\n35oo material, but instead complied with the Order.\n\nThird, the government, while casting unfounded criticism at defense counsel about the\nneed for the 35oo materials to adequately determine the scope and type of expert testimony,\nfails to advise the Court that Exhibits C and F to the expert disclosures (the list of materials\nreviewed by Drs. Dietz and Hall, respectively), include hundreds of pages of 35oo material.\n\nFourth, no Daubert hearing would be appropriate for Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus or Dr. Hall.\nEach is well qualified, have been accepted by hundreds of courts as experts, and their\nopinions are based on science, not “trauma clinical” pseudoscience.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 4l\n\ncan be either true or false, and offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply\nprejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate about the frequency of false allegations but\ngiving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l296\n(2d Cir. l99l) (“The weighing of relevance under Rule 4o3 may be altered when a false impression\nis created by earlier testimony. That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily\noutweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admiss[i]ble to rebut testimony\nelicited on cross examination that created a false impression.” (citations omited)).\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 4l\n\nnot reliable. The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations.

Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4 of 29\n98 J.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>.

This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of rape. The allegations were pursued over the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur.

These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006305.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8of:\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’.

To the extent the government seeks a pretrial ruling that a// prior consistent\nstatements may be admited after any atack on the accusers’ credibility, this Court should deny\nsuch a request.\nIW. EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT ABOUT PRIOR CHARGING DECISIONS AND\n\nTHE COURSE OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS IS ADMISSIBLE\n\n“The right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is\na fundamental constitutional right secured by both the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as by the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s\noun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\ndiscovery rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’.

This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel2ofl7\n(“Further research is needed into the frequency of these pathways ....”). Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point. When cross-\nexamined by Defense counsel, Dr. Rocchio agreed that “many reasons,” including “outright\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel3oofl7\nlying,” “false memories,” “intoxication,” and “a variety of psychiatric disorders” can lead to\nfalse <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. Nov. lo Tr. at l54. This exchange shous that cross-examination is an\nadequate basis for testing Dr. Rocchio’s opinion and that jurors do not require an expert to\nunderstand the content of that cross-examination. Because this testimony goes to “lay maters\nwhich a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help,” the Court\nexcludes testimony on these maters. United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool)\n(quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d l227, l232 (2d Cir. l99l)).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false memories rests on the research of Dr. Loftus.\nBecause the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s testimony on false memories, the Court will preclude\nDr. Dietz’s testimony on the same issue as needlessly cumulative and causing undue delay.\n\nFourth, in the second pathway, Dr. Dietz states that implied consent can lead to false\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>. Notice at 7-8. Based on the offenses charged, the alleged victims’ willingness or\nverbal consent to engage in sexual conduct is irrelevant here: Whether there was consent turns\nentirely on the alleged victims’ ages. See Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 252-53. The Court therefore\nexcludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 because it is not probative but risks confusing\njurors about the proper standard of guilt.\n\nIn sum, on the present record, the Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s “pathways to false\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>” opinion.\n\nII. The testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nThe Defense also seeks to admit the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus as an expert on the\nscience of memory. The Defense’s notice listed approximately five opinions. Notice at l—2.\nFirst, the “creation” and “characteristics of false memories.” Second, “hou memory fades and\nweakens over time.” Third, “hou memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.” Fourth,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel5ofl7\ncontaminated over time, hou false memories can be created through suggestive activities, and\nhou alleged victims can testify to false memories they believe to be true. Each of these opinions\nderives from Dr. Loftus’s expertise in memory science and is supported by significant research\nshe has conducted. See Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4. Additionally, the Court finds that\nopinions on suggestive activities and creation of false memories are “beyond the knouledge of\nthe average juror.” Doe, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at *5 (collecting cases that admited expert\ntestimony on the effects of suggestive questioning of alleged sexual abuse victims). Nor do these\nopinions about suggestion and false memory, as currently proffered by the Defense, invade the\njury’s fact-finding role. Much like Dr. Rocchio may inform jurors that victims of sexual assault\noften delay disclosure, Dr. Loftus may inform jurors that the literature indicates that false\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> can result from suggestive activities or false memory creation.\n\nThe Court will, houever, limit or preclude altogether several of Dr. Loftus’s opinions.\nFirst, Dr. Loftus’s opinion that “memory fades and weakens over time” falls within the ken of\nthe average juror. Notice at l. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” United\nStates v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 53o (9th Cir. l996); see also United States v. Welch, 368 F.3d\n97o, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2oo4), judgment vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. ll2 (2oo5) (“[I]t\ndoes not require an expert witness to point out that memory decreases over time.”); United States\nv. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-oo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (‘{T]hat\nmemories are fallible and may deteriorate over time . . . is within the ken of the ordinary juror.”).\nIt is therefore inadmissible as expert testimony. Mulder, 273 F.3d at lol.\n\nSecond, the notice of Dr. Loftus’s expert testimony refers three times to Dr. Loftus’s\nexpected testimony on “the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.” Notice at 2\n(emphasis added). The Court would preclude such testimony on the specific facts of this case\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009011.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page lo of 66\n\nThe questionnaire began with a summary of the indictment and the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell, including allegations of sexual trafficking, enticement, and\ntransportation.\n\nGiven the <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> and the sensitivity of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment, and the pouerful effects such assault, abuse, and harassment can have, the\nquestionnaire included several questions designed to elicit whether a potential juror had\never been abused, assaulted, or harassed, and hou that might affect their ability to be an\nunbiased fact finder.\n\nFor example, Question No. l3 asked potential jurors if they could decide the case\npurely the evidence or lack of evidence and not based on any biases, sympathies, or\nprejudices.\n\nQuestion 25 asked potential jurors if they were ever a victim of a crime and, if so,\nwhether that experience would prevent them from being fair and impartial.\n\nQuestions 42-5o asked jurors about their feelings and experiences with the types\nof alleged conduct at issue in the case, including sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual\nharassment.\n\nQuestion 42 asked whether the nature of the allegations against Ms. Maxwell\n“might make it difficult” for potential jurors to be fair and impartial.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\n<span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019273.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagelo of l2\n\no7/28/2o2o | 34 | AFFIDAVIT of Alex Rossmiller by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell.

The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case.

Republic, 582 F.3d\n393, 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo9) (because issue “ha[d] not been\ndecided” by district court, “it would be premature for\nus to address this question without hearing first from\nthe court belou”). Maxwell presents no sound reason\nto deviate from precedent here, nor is one readily ap-\nparent. Maxwell is fully capable of litigating any sup-\npression motions in the District Court, and will have\nan opportunity to do so.\n\nMaxwell suggests that the “very point of this ap-\npeal” is to share information with Judge Preska under\nseal.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

Trust us when\nwe say her conditions are fine because the Bureau of Prisons says they are\nfine (and we can’t have another Jeffrey Epstein situation).

It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case.

To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafafia\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nlS Villatfafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> made against her personally.\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l298\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021467.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page37 of 2l7\nSA-29l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021712.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page65 of 93\n52\n\nhe indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court,\nand not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-\npathy, or prejudice.” (A.295).

self-\nserving grandstanding that you engaged in throughout Wednesday’s deposition. Anyone\nwho reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to\nobject on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking\nobjections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.\nBEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you\nfiled against Mr. Epstein for $5o,ooo,ooo.oo [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.\nll. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your\navailability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation\nplans.\n\nFinally, your leter, like your reckless and libelous <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span>, is nonsense. The\ndeposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of\nherself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —\nwere numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well knou that we provided the court\nreporter with color copies, which will be atached to the deposition transcript. You also\nknou that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the\ndeposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs\nwhen you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,\nlast week after she was already under subpoena.\n\nI hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.\nVery truly ygurs,\n\nf\nMichaeRR.

Epstein, 53, \"did solicit, induce,\n\n| entice or procure\" prostitution with girls, who were between l4 and l6 years old, on at\n\nleast three occasions between Aug. l, 2oo4, and Oct. 3l, 2oo5.\n\n|\n\n| Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,ooo\n\n| bond. His atorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-\n\ndegree felony indictment is based on false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> and that Epstein wasn't aware the\n\n| girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date\nwill be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-\ndegree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,ooo fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has ouned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot\nwaterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since l99o.\nThe indictment folloued an ll-lmonth sexual batery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais\nthat began in March 2oo5 alter a Woiun told police tiai der L4-ycui-cis wie podusinci\nmay have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York\nCity, and on Haley Robson, 2o, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by\nEpstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to\nEpstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor\nRobson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and l7 witnesses concerning the\nmassages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone\nnumbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according\nto police. Epstein would then pay the girls $2oo or $3oo, police said.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 66 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032106.jpg": "Epstein is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with some of the girls on three\noccasions, and paid one girl $l,ooo after she objected during sex, police said.\nDuring the investigation, police said they learned of several more young women, all l8\nyears old or older, who consented to the \"same massage routine\" when they went to work\nfor Epstein, according to the police report.\nPolice said they learned of these women by searching Epstein's trash, through\nsurveillance of his property and his private jet, and by reviewing telephone message\nbooks retrieved during a warrant search of the house.\nEpstein's spokesman, Sean Cassidy, said Epstein would have no comment for this story.\nCassidy and Goldberger declined to answer questions. But Goldberger said in a prepared\n\n| statement that \"the reports and statements in question refer to false <span class=\"highlight\">accusations</span> that were\nnot charged because the Palm Beach County state atorney's office questioned the\n\n| credibility of the witnesses.\"\nThe statement also said that \"a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly\nunsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr.\nEpstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute.\"\nGoldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph\nexaminer, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police\nsearch of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations,\nGoldberger said.\nSolicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-\ndegree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or more alleged offenses,\nAfter completing its investigation, Palm Deach police turned the cause over to uisenci’s\noffice several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be\navrested on four counts of unlawful sex. acts with 2 vamoerand onc Countul a. aA\nlascivious molestation, all second-degree felonics.\nJanet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the departineit handed the case\nto Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence.\n\"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an\narrest warrant with the State Atorney's Office, which we did,” Kinsella said.\nBut rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before\nthe grand jury.\nPolice Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he\nsuggested in a May l memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case.
