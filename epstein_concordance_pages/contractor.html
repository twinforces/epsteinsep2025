While the\nGovernment has not moved for modification on these grounds, I address this factor in light of the\ncurrent proceedings before the Second Circuit.\nThe term is not well understood. See United States v. Taleo Contractors, Inc., l53 |\nF.R.D. 5ol, 5ll (W.D.N.Y. l994) (observing that the Circuit “provided no guidance as to what |\nmight constitute ‘improvidence in the grant of a... protective order’”). To date, the Second |\nCircuit has identified two ways in which an order might be considered “improvidently granted.” |\nThe first is, essentially, that it was issued in bad faith. Houever, this is a high bar. For example, |\na sealing order is “improvidently granted” where the presiding judge “reasonably should have |\nrecognized that [it] would facilitate or further criminal activity.” Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 865-66. |\n|\nBut there is absolutely no evidence that the district court harbored any such realization; indeed, |\nat the time Judge Sweet entered the Order, it appeared that criminal activity against Maxwell and\n|\nEpstein was a thing of the past.* Nothing in the record indicates that the entry of the Protective\n2 In 2oo7, financier Jeffrey Epstein plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court, arising from\nallegations that he “assembl[ed] a large, cult-like network of underage girls-—with the help of young female\nrecruiters” (including Maxwell)—whom he coerced into performing sex acts “behind the walls of his opulent\nwaterfront mansion,” among other locations, “as often as three times a day.” Julie K. Broun, Hou a future Trump\nCabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime, Miami Herald (Nov. 28, 2ol8),\nhtps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article22oo97825.html. The deal also included a non-prosecution\nagreement with the Department of Justice, which immunized Epstein and four named accomplices from all federal\ncharges, broadly immunized “any potential co-conspirators,” and—in contravention of federal law—kept the\nagreement secret from Epstein’s victims. Jd. Epstein served just thirteen months in county jail, during part of which\nhe was permited to continue working from his dountoun office. Jd.\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published a series of feature articles describing the allegations\nagainst Epstein and suggesting that the plea deal constituted Government misconduct.

The expose garnered atention from the media\nand from Congress and has apparently prompted an investigation by the Department of Justice. Jd. Whether the\ngrand jury subpoena arose out of this renewed interest in Epstein’s behavior is ultimately not relevant to the Court’s\ndecision—but it seems likely.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo887 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4937\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 27 |\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThe term “extraordinary circumstances” is not well defined. See Talco Contractors, Inc., |\n\nl53 F.R.D. at 5ll. Houever, the Second Circuit has recognized that this requirement may be |\nmet in circumstances involving significant public interest, particularly where no good cause |\nshouing was made to the court initially. See Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l48 (“exceptionally |\n|\n\npervasive protection granted appellants during the pretrial stages of this litigation, coupled with |\nthe fact that appellants never were required to shou good cause,” as well as the fact that there |\nwas “enormous public interest in the Agent Orange litigation,” demonstrated extraordinary |\ncircumstances); but see Ionosphere Clubs, l56 B.R. at 435 (“[M]ere breadth” of a protective |\norder does not, by itself constitute “extraordinary circumstances.”). Indeed, some district courts |\nin this Circuit go one step further, holding that “The heightened Martindell ‘extraordinary |\ncircumstances’ standard . . . is not appropriate in cases with stipulated protective orders that grant |\nparties open-ended and unilateral deference to protect whichever discovery materials they |\nchoose.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l. |\nHere, as discussed, no party was required to make a good cause shouing before |\ndesignating any particular discovery materials as confidential. Moreover, there is significant |\npublic interest: the Government has convened a grand jury to investigate a serious crime |\n(potentially involving multiple victims), which from its inception has garnered extensive |\npublicity, and which (most recently) includes troubling allegations of misconduct on the part of |\nGovernment officials, including a then-United States Atorney who is nou a member of the |\nPresident’s Cabinet. The Court agrees with the Government that, because the investigation is not |\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify :\nand to produce documents]... would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the :\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo897 :\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4947 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-3 Filed o9/o7/2l Page 5of 22\nATTACHMENT A\nDEFINITIONS\n\nl. “You” or “Your” means Brad Edwards and any ouner, shareholder, partner, employee or\nindependent <span class=\"highlight\">contractor</span> of Edwards Potinger and any former ouner, shareholder, partner or\nemployee, or independent <span class=\"highlight\">contractor</span> of the firm. “You” or “Your” also refers to any\nshareholder, partner, employee or independent <span class=\"highlight\">contractor</span> of any other law firm with which\nYou were employed or formally associated at the responsive time.\n\n2. “United States Atorney” means any employee of the office of the United States Atorney for\nthe Southern District of New York during the relevant time period including but not limited\nto Amanda Kramer, Alex Rossmiller, Allison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, Maurene Comey and\nAndrew Rohrbach. “United States Atorney” also includes any employee of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation.\n\n3. “Communication” means all forms of correspondence, including regular mail, email, text\nmessage, memorandum, or other writen communication of information of any kind.\n\n4. “Contingent Fee Agreement” or “Engagement Agreement” means any writing describing the\nterms that You agreed to perform legal services for Annie Farmer, Maria Farmer,\nSo a.\n\n5. “Maria Farmer Physical Evidence” means the “hundreds of photographs,” “old diaries,”\n“telephone books,” “Rolodexes,” and “mementos . . . collected from [Maria Farmer’s] time\nwith Epstein and Maxwell” that You viewed at the home of Maria Farmer in Paducah, KY\nhome in or about June 2ol6, as described in excerpts from Relentless Pursuit, atached as\nExhibit A.\n\n6. “EVCP Material” refers to any submission to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nmade by You, including any claims on behalf of persons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or\nGhislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases signed by You or Your Clients, and any\ncompensation received by You or Your Clients.

The indictment\nalleged that on August 9, 2ol9, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and lo p.m. counts of inmates\nin the MCC New York SHU, and that on August lo, 2ol9, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the\nmandatory l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 3o-minute rounds within the MCC New York\nSHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submited false\ndocumentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to\nperform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,\nincluding Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9, until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, when\nEpstein was found hanged in his cell.\nOn May 25, 2o2l, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred\nprosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court\nrecord in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had\nconducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely\ndisclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the\nU.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete loo hours of\ncommunity service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision\nand their establishment of good behavior. On December l3, 2o2l, after Noel and Thomas successfully\nfulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all\ncharges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count\nslips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and\nThomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor\njudgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.\nI. Methodology\nDuring the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one\noccasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023374.jpg": "requested to provide information.© The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included\nemployees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the\ndays leading up to the response and follouing the response, as well as other individuals with information\npertinent to our investigation. Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of l5 inmates who had been\nhoused at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were\nhoused in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.’ Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells\nopposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9-lo.\nThe OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s atorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information,\nbut ultimately the atorney declined to be interviewed, citing atorney-client privilege (the atorney-client\nprivilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate.\nThe OIG also collected over l27,ooo documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs. Among\nthese were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports;\ndocumentation regarding inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment\ndocumentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating\nto Epstein; Epstein’s institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein’s visits with his\natorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and\ncontractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC\nNew York security camera system; service records for MCC New York's security camera system; MCC\nNew York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records.\nThe OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones.\nIn addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-3o2), notes from\nwitness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications. The OIG also reviewed Epstein’s\nautopsy report and interviewed the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Epstein.\nll. Applicable Law, Regulations, and BOP Policies\nA.

Further, the different purposes of the\ntwo atorney log books, one in the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books\ncould not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not\nconsistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled,\nlog book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the\ncurrent time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.\nInstitution Response: 9. Atorney Log Books:\nOn August lo, 2ol9, log books deemed relevant to the investigation were removed from various locations\nthroughout the facility. The Reconstruction Team did identify pertinent logbooks that had not been secured. At this\ntime, all relevant logbooks have been removed and replaced. In addition, a logbook audit was conducted to ensure\naccuracy of the documentation and compliance with policy. Measures are being taken to ensure in the future that all\nrelevant logbooks are identified, secured immediately and replaced with new ones to ensure the institution can\ncontinue to run efficiently.\nlo.

The\nreport was accurate and complete. New AEDs have been purchased and will be inspected Great Lakes Biomedical\nServices upon their arrival.

The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N9ooLS registration,\nwas on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently\nacquired the services of a new atorney, and the fact that Epstein's\nhouse is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may\nbe in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,\n358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting\nremodeling at the house. The <span class=\"highlight\">contractor</span>, David Norr, was observed\ndriving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida\nregistration of F3oQoF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north\non County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr.\nNorr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain\njobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I\ntraveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue\nstripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was.\nvisible on the botom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane.\nWe maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a\ncaravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed\nseveral people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of\nthe executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach\nCounty for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm\nBeach County on May 9, 2oo6 at 9:3o pm and were scheduled to leave on\nthe loth at 5:oo pm.\nOn May l2, 2oo6, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State\nAtorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was\nrequesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to\nher I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen,\nand Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or\ndirect file, as sg much time has elapsed since the original request to\nthe Grand Jury. e explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had\nconcluded the case _in December of 2oo5 and has been waiting for the\ncase to go forward] Belohlavek stated the original offer was again\noffered to the new defense atorney. She was waiting for their answer\nby Friday May l9, 2oo6. She stated she would advise me of the answer.\nKH KKK KEKE KKKKKEK N A R R A vi Wy IT V E # 45 KEKKEKKKEKEKKKEKEKKKEKEKKEKEKKKK KKK\nReported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 6/o5/o6\no7/26/l7 Page 23ll Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32624\n"};
