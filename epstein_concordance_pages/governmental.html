For this reason, even “[t]he most outrageous\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003060.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 239\nbehavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that\nevidence inadmissible.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at l66.\n\nThis does not mean that only action undertaken directly by the Government may violate\nthe Fifth Amendment (or another right). In certain circumstances, a private entity may be deemed\nto be acting as a government agent. See United States v. Stein, 54l F.3d l3o, l46 (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(“Actions of a private entity are atributable to the State if there is a sufficiently close nexus\nbetween the State and the challenged action of the entity so that the action of the later may be\nfairly treated as that of the State itself.” (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nHouever, this standard “‘is not satisfied when the state merely approves of or acquiesces in\nthe initiatives of the private entity, or when an entity is merely subject to <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> regulation.”\nId. (internal quotations marks and citations omited; alterations incorporated)). Nor is it sufficient\nthat a non-government entity chooses to cooperate with a government investigation or has its oun\nparallel investigation. See id. at l5o. Non-government action is atributable to the government\n“only when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the\n[defendant] complains.” Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 99l, loo4 (l982) (emphasis in original).\n“Such responsibility is normally found when the State ‘has exercised coercive pouer or has\nprovided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be\ndeemed to be that of the State.’” Stein, 54l F.3d at l47 (quoting Blum, 457 US. at loo4); see also\nFlagg v. Yonkers Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 396 F.3d l78, l87 (2d Cir. 2oo5).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s Fifth Amendment claim fails because she has not\ndemonstrated state action.

Souleymane Balde\nBernard R. Siskin, Ph.D.\nl. INTRODUCTION\n\nl. lama Director of BLDS, LLC, a specialty consulting firm. Prior to joining BLDS, I\ndid similar work at the specialty consulting firms, LECG, LLC, the Center for Forensic\nEconomic Studies, Inc., and National Economic Research Associates (NERA). Prior to that, I\nwas a tenured faculty member and Chairman of the Department of Statistics at Temple\nUniversity in Philadelphia. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics with a minor in Econometrics from\nthe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in l97o. I have authored four books on\nstatistical methodology, three book chapters, four research monographs, and numerous papers,\nincluding articles on the role of statistics in the analysis of employment discrimination issues.\nSince receiving my Ph.D., I have specialized in the application of statistics to the analysis of\nemployment practices. In this capacity, I have been retained by numerous <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> private\norganizations including, but not limited to, the Third Circuit Task Force on Race and Gender, the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Civil Rights Division of the United\nStates Justice Department, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP), the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, and various states and municipalities as well as numerous private\ncorporations.

There is no good faith.\n\nThe rebutal to government’s good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith\nwhen the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search.\nAs the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon,\n\nSuppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing\n\na warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false\n\nor would have knoun was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.\n\n468 U.S. 897, 923 (l984).\n\nHere, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support\nthereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order\nand authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (reversing\ndistrict court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 26 of 34\nreports were replete with misrepresentations and outright lies about the conversations he had\nwith, and information provided by, a confidential informant. /d. at l2l2-l3. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed the district court’s order suppressing the evidence obtained from the search\nconducted under the warrant. /d. at l2l3. “This search,” said the Court, “never should have taken\nplace.” Id.\n\nThe Court offered two bases for its decision. It first invoked the Franks analysis to affirm\nthe district court’s conclusion that Agent Broun intentionally or recklessly misrepresented\nmaterial information in Agent Stewart’s affidavit. /d. But the Court went further, concluding that\nsuppression was independently required as a mater of inherent authority. Jd. at l2l4-l7.\nBecause Agent Broun lied in the affidavit (in addition to lying at the Franks hearing), “[t]he call\nfor the court’s supervisory pouer under the[] circumstances is at its strongest and most\ndefensible.” /d. at l2l4.\n\nThe Court recognized that the inherent authority doctrine is not a free pass for courts to\nsuppress evidence or “merely [to] disagree with the method|[s] of law enforcement.” /d. “[T]he\nfederal supervisory pouer does not give ‘the federal judiciary a ‘chancellor’s foot’ veto over law\nenforcement practices of which it (does) not approve.’” Jd. (quoting United States v. Russell, 4ll\nUS. 423, 435 (l973)). Even so, inherent authority is properly invoked to “prevent[] the court\nfrom condoning a fraud perpetrated upon it.” /d. Suppression serves both to deter unlawful\n<span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> conduct and to protect judicial integrity. /d. (weighing “the deterrent values of\npreventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated . . . and the need to\nprotect the integrity of the federal courts against the cost to society of excluding ‘probative but\ntainted evidence’”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel2 of 2l\nWilliams, 467 U.S. 43l, 446 (l984); United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (l984). The Court\nagrees that, at the very least, the exception to the exclusionary rule for inevitable discovery\napplies to the documents that have since been unsealed and made public in the civil case. But\nbecause the Court finds no violation of the Fourth Amendment, it concludes that none of the\ndocuments should be suppressed.\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent\n\nauthority\n\nMaxwell next argues that the materials must be suppressed because the Government\nviolated her due process rights in obtaining them. The gravamen of this claim is that the\nGovernment misrepresented its prior contacts with BSF to Judge McMahon. Maxwell contends\nthat this misrepresentation violated her due process rights, or alternatively that the Court should\nexercise its inherent authority to suppress the evidence obtained through the subpoena as a\nsanction for <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> misconduct. She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result. She further seeks an evidentiary\nhearing to explore whether any misrepresentation by the Government in that hearing was\nintentional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts have a limited inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence obtained in “willful disobedience of law.” United States v. Payner, 447 USS.\n727, 735 n.7 (l98o) (quoting McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 345 (l943)). But it has\nalso cautioned that courts must exercise this pouer with restraint. /d. Thus, “the court should\nnot exercise its inherent or supervisory pouer ‘as a substitute for Fourth Amendment\nJurisprudence.’” United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting United\nStates v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 792 (2d Cir. l996)).

As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is necessary or appropriate in these circumstances. If\nnecessary, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\napplication for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a protective order in her earlier civil\ncase. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 365 _ Filed lo/22/2l Page l2 of 4o\nJuror ID:\n| If yes, please explain:\n| | PRIOR JURY SERVICE\n44l8 Have you ever served as a juror in a trial in any court?\na Yes a No\n\n48.l9 Have you ever at any time served as a member of a grand jury, whether in federal,\n\nstate, county, or city court?\na Yes a No\n| | EXPERIENCE AS A WITNESS, DEFENDANT, OR CRIME VICTIM\n49-2o Have you, or has any relative or close friend, ever participated in a state or federal\ncourt case, whether criminal or civil, as a witness, plaintiff, or defendant?\na Yes (self) o Yes (friend or family member) a No\n| ta?

But it was also traumatizing to relive the experience, and\nflashbacks and the nightmares have increased.\n\nIam grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict.

Who and what institution\nenabled this sex trafficking ring to continue. Why haven’t the institutions and important people that\nenabled them been exposed and brought to justice?

There\nis simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the\npossession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case,\nregarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct\nrequired rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other\ntimes also allegedly falsified records.\n\nThe cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the\nNinth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents\nlocated in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS\ninvestigation. 868 F.2d lo32, lo35-37 (9th Cir. l989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit\nexplained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might\nhave documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule l6’s disclosure requirements are cabined\nto anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the\ndefendant.” /d. at lo36 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d\n2o4, 22l (E.D.N.Y. l999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that\n“TcJourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrouly to mean the prosecutors in the\nparticular case or the <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant,\nand not the ‘government’ in general.” And while the court in United States v.

Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the\ndeliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which <span class=\"highlight\">governmental</span> decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532\nU.S. l, 8 (2ool) (quoting V.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 42l U.S. l32, l5o (l975)). The\nprivilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative\nprocess privilege); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C. Cir. l997) (indicating that the\nprivilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284\n(S.D.N.Y. l998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). “In order for the privilege to apply,\nthe agency record at issue must be (l) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or leter; (2)\npre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.” Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d\nl5o, l55 (2d Cir. 2o2o). “Tt is well-setled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically\npre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors;\nviews that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their\nsuperiors.” Color of Change v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol8) (quoting Amnesty Int’l USA v. CIA, 728 F.
