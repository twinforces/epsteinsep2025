Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l3\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the\ndistrict in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates\na broader restriction.”) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He <span class=\"highlight\">organized</span>, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000558.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 48 of 74 48\n\nl that your Honor has clear and convincing proof occurred, much\n\n2 less the predictive factor that if Mr. Epstein was released\n\n3 under the kind of combination of conditions, there would be any\n4 risk of his influencing adversely a witness, nou that there is\n5 a federal prosecution.

Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\n<span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\n<span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. lo\n\nPROFESSIONAL ADVOCACY\n\nCongressional Visits\n\nVisits <span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> by the American Psychological Association:\n\nMarch, 2ol6 Medicare and Mental Health Reform.

This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\n<span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 457 Filed ll/l3/2l Page3of8\nPage 3\nGuestrooms).” See Government Exhibit 6o6 at 7; see also id. at lo (“JE and GM telephone\ndirectories [are] placed to the right of telephone” in “check off list” for “pre-arrival preparations”\nfor the master bedroom); id. at 22 (“JE and GM telephone directories” in Vehicles and Bicycles\nsection); id. at 23 (“JE and GM telephone directories placed to the right of the telephone” for “Ms\nMaxwell’s desk”).\n\nEmployee-l has examined Government Exhibit 52 in preparation for trial and recognizes\nit to be the defendant’s contact book, copies of which were maintained in Epstein’s Palm Beach\nresidence, among other locations.

Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” prong\napplies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knouing participants; (i) the\nnumber of unknouing participants whose activities were <span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> or led by the defendant with\nspecific criminal intent; (ill) the extent to which the services of the unknouing participants were\npeculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o3-o4. In seting out\nthese factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knouing participants” is “relevant” to\nthe analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knouing participants that is aided by unknouing\nparticipants is more likely to be ‘otherwise extensive’ than a scheme with a single knouing\nparticipant.” Jd. at 8o4. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknouing participants, the\nCircuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals\nwho function more like knouing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the\nspecific intent” to further the criminal activity.\n\nIn this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant\nmust have supervised at least one knouing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly\ncontemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknouing\nparticipants. See id. Consistent with that understanding, and contrary to the defense’s proposed\ninterpretation, the Circuit has affirmed the application of § 3Bl.l under the “otherwise extensive”\nprong to two defendants who were themselves the only two knouing participants identified in the\nscheme. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. That outcome makes clear that the Circuit does not require\na defendant to supervise any other knouing participant in the scheme. Of particular note, the\nRubenstein case applied the “otherwise extensive” enhancement” where the two knouing\nparticipants worked together, with one serving as a “right-hand man” to the other, while they\n<span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> “as many as seven participants who were unknouing,” who worked under the\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\n<span class=\"highlight\">organized</span> all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments.

Whether criminal activity is extensive is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity.

Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the tme OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nl2 U.S. Const. amend.
