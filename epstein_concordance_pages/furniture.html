This comment about Epstein’s distinct decorating style may seem implausible to jurors. But\nthe Government observed and photographed more than one stuffed animal that could fairly be\ndescribed as “creepy looking” during its search of Epstein’s house, including as depicted in\nGovernment Exhibit 9387:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe fact that this stuffed tiger is movable property is counterbalanced by the fact that it is\nhighly idiosyncratic. While the Government would not argue that Epstein had this particular\nstuffed tiger in his home in the mid-l99os, it is probative of Jane’s testimony that—at any point in\ntime—Epstein possessed the kind of “creepy looking animals” that she described.\n\nThird, the Government would offer six photos—Government Exhibits 9o9 through 9ll,\n9l3, 9l5, and 933—to demonstrate structural features of the house. Some of these photographs\nwill provide context for the law enforcement officer’s testimony by shouing the entrance areas of\nthe house which she searched. And all of them will corroborate Jane’s testimony that the house\nwas intimidating and contains significant amounts of wood and stone, as Jane stated. (ll/3o/2l\nTr. at 3l7-l8 (describing the house as “massive” and made her feel “Intimidated.”); 32o\n(explaining that the house had “Lots of stone, you knou, old wood.”)). Neither of these theories\ninvolve movable property of any kind, and the Government would not argue that any movable\n<span class=\"highlight\">furniture</span> or artwork was present when Jane visited the house.”\n\nFourth, Epstein’s home contained a large number of photographs of celebrities, including\n* A stuffed dog is also depicted in Government Exhibit 936.\n> The Government also notes that the Court has already ruled that it will reserve, subject to\nconnection, on the admissibility of costumes from the search, which are marked as physical\nexhibits and depicted in Government Exhibits 9l9 and 92o. (l2/o3/2l Tr. at 929). The\nGovernment similarly will offer Government Exhibits 9l9 and 92o subject to connection.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo822o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page/7of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 7\n\nThe government atempts to marginalize this Court’s legitimate concern about highly\nmobile items. But the Court’s concern is well founded. Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. <span class=\"highlight\">Furniture</span> is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8. But if that’s so, then there’s\nno probative value to the unauthenticated photographs, particular when, as the Court\nacknouledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence. TR l2/3/2o2l, p\nlo77:3.\n\nBecause the government has not authenticated the 2ol9 photos as accurate\nrepresentations of Mr. Epstein’s house in l994 or l995 or l996, they are irrelevant. But even if\nthey were relevant, this Court could still exclude them as unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. They are misleading because, as McCormick recognizes, the government has\nnot shoun the lack of changed conditions. § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th\ned.). And they are unfairly prejudicial because they depict something occurring fifteen years\nafter the charged conspiracy, they have no connection to Ms. Maxwell, and they are\ninflammatory. Fed. R.
