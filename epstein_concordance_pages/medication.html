Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic <span class=\"highlight\">medication</span>. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic <span class=\"highlight\">medication</span> is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The\ncriminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page l9 of 32 l5\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl lunch was on the way.\n\n2 I froze in a cell for seven-and-a-half months with no\ni) heat, sleeping with a hat, gloves, sweat pants and sweatshirts.\n4 The cell that they put me in MCC, the ventilation was totally\n\n5 broke.

See Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2.\n\nEven if any diagnosis were probative, the Court further finds that Rule 4o3 prejudice\noutweighs. First, the testimony may confuse jurors with old diagnoses that have litle connection\nto the conduct at issue or Alleged Victim 4’s credibility today. See id.

Epstein was also given an eye and dental exam, as well as a blood panel screening. This\nsection details Epstein’s psychological evaluations while he was in MCC New York custody prior to his death.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, at 9:38 p.m., upon Epstein’s intake into MCC New York, he was medically screened\nby Physician Assistant 2. The screening included taking vital signs and asking various medical history\nquestions, including questions related to Epstein’s mental health. Among other things, Physician Assistant 2\nannotated that Epstein did not have current suicidal ideation and had denied having a history of suicide\natempts. Physician Assistant 2 instructed Epstein hou he could obtain medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care.\nAt 2:58 a.m. on Sunday, July 7, 2ol9, a Facilities Assistant emailed the Psychology Department asking that\nsomeone evaluate Epstein because he appeared “distraught, sad, and a litle confused.”\nOn July 8, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist l of the Psychology Department conducted an Intake Screening of\nEpstein that included a self-report, staff observation, and a review of information in SENTRY.

The Correctional Systems Officer notified\nthe New York Police Department (NYPD) via the MCC New York institutional NYPD telephone. The\nCorrectional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance and medical\nassistance for one of the inmates. The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York at\n6:43 a.m. and were escorted to the second-floor medical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein\nand a BOP escort via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at 7:lo a.m.\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant\nprior to 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, but was still working on things like the Daily Activity Reports and\nLieutenant Logs that she did not get to finish during her shift. At some point, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she\nknew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done. The Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant estimated that she went to the SHU around 7 a.m. to help with the inmate\nmeals, and believed the Electronics Technician was also helping out. Noel was there, but she was not\nhelping with delivering food to the inmates. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the\nmeals were delivered, she finished up and went home.\nAll MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any\ninformation suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts. Other MCC New York staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and\naccountability measures had been property executed, an inmate who wanted to take his life would have\nfound a way to do so.\nB. Items Found in Epstein’s Cell on August lo Follouing His Death\nFollouing Epstein’s death, the BOP and FBI collected many of the items found inside Epstein’s cell. The FBI\ninspected the cell and retrieved what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player. The FBI did not recover\nany weapons inside of the cell. After the FBI's inspection, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and\ncollected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including\nreligious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, bateries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a broun\npaper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023463.jpg": "the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier\nof the SHU.\nWe also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shoun in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in\nplain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,\nincluding into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,\nunbeknounst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that\ntime. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health.
