SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span>. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) <span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span> at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) <span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span> at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case.

If the Defense\nanticipated calling a witness who refuses to testify, the Defense would have the same tools at its\ndisposal as does the Government to compel that witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span> at trial. The Defense could\nhave, for example, subpoenaed a witness under Rule l7. If the witness resides abroad, the\nDefense could have sought a leter rogatory under 28 U.S.C. § l78l, which is a mechanism that\nthe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized. See, e.g., United States v. Brennerman, 8l8 F.\nApp’x 25, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2o) (citing § l78l as a mechanism for a criminal defendant to “secure\ntestimony from the United Kingdom’’); United States v. Lee, 723 F.3d l34, l42 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2ol3). These mechanisms ensure that pseudonyms are not necessary to secure a reluctant\nwitness’s testimony and the Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting pseudonyms.\n\nThird, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for a witness that works as a plain\nclothes law enforcement officer, citing in support a large body of case law in which anonymity\nwas granted for testifying law enforcement officers. Def. Leter at 5. But as the Government\nnotes, the cases relied on by the Defense uniformly involve officers that work undercover such\nthat revealing their true name to the public would subject them to violent retaliation by the\ndefendant or other individuals, or would frustrate their ability to remain undercover. E.g., United\nStates v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8); United States v. Hernandez, No. Sl\nl2 CR 8o9 PKC, 2ol3 WL 3936l85 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2ol3). Even further afield, the Defense\ncites in support a case in which a covert CIA officer testified under a pseudonym. United States\nv. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o). These cases are inapplicable to the present\nrequest as proffered to the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document558 Filed l2/l9/2l Page4of5\nthe slides follouing the conclusion of closing arguments.

Follouing\nEpstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an\nopportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the\nCVRA.

But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here.

A modeling photo of\nMs. Ransome produced in her discovery appeared on the Emperor’s Club advertisement. The government\nprosecuted the Emperor’s Club ouners. See United States v.

Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024221.jpg": "Good morning Christine,\n| apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday.

In support, Epstein states: |\n\nIntroduction and Background\n\nl. On August l9, 2oo9, Defendant sent a Notice for Taking the Deposition of Jane\n\nDoe No, 4 for September l6, 2oo9. See Exhibit “l” |\n\no3956-lo994\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030284.tif": "Case 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document 3o5-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Page 3 of ll\nCase 9:o8-cv-8ol49-KAM Document296 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/ll/2oo9 = Page 3 of 33\nPage 3\nincluding discovery? The short answer is unequivocally, yes. To hold otherwise would be a\ndirect violation of Epstein’s constitutional due process rights. Plaintiffs’ aifempts to play fast\nand loose with the law should not be tolerated. .\n\n¢. As the court is aware, plaintiffs and defendants routinely atend depositions of |\nparties and other witnesses in both State and Federal court proceedings. In fact, parties have a |\n\nright under the law to atend such depositions.\n\n8. _ Ag the court will note from Exhibit 2, counsel for the Defendant specifically |\nstated that “Please be advised that Mr. Epstein plans to be in <span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span> at the deposition of your\nclient. He does not intend to engage in any conversation with your client. Houever, it is |\ncertainly his right as a party-defendant in the lawsuit to be present and to assist counsel in the\ndefense of any case.” Despite this right, Plaintiffs continue to atempt to control hou discovery\nis conducted in this case and hou this court has historically governed discovery. :\n\n. 9. Interestingly, in Jane Doe If, the state court case, atorney Sid Garcia took the |\ndeposition of the Defendant and his client, Jane Doe II, was present throughout the deposition. |\nThis is despite her claims of “emotional trauma” set forth in her complaint. Jane Doe No. ¥ is . |\nalso a Plaintiff in the federal court proceeding Jane Doe il y. Jeffrey Epstein (Case No. o9-CIV- |\n\n8o469). Is this court going to stari a precedent where it allous Plaintiffs to atend the depositions |\nof Jeffrey Epstein, but not allou Epstein to atend their depositions (i.e., the very Plaintiffs that |\nhave asserted claims against him for millions of dolars)?_ This court should not condone such a |\n\n4o. The undersigned is well aware of the court’s No-Contact Order entered on July . .\n3l, 2oo9 (DE 238). A copy of the order is atached as Exhibit “3”. In fact, the order provides |\nthat the defendant have no direct or indirect contact with the plaintiffs, nor communications with .\n\no3956-lo996\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030285.tif": "Case 9:o8-cvy-8oll9-KAM Document3o5-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Page 4 of ll\nCase 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document296 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/ll/2oo9 Page 4 of 33\n, Page 4 ;\nthe plaintiffs either directly or indirectly. Houever, there is no prohibition against Mr. Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span> at a deposition where, as is reflected in the order, the communication will be made to\n| the plaintiff solely through defense counsel with one or more of plaintiffs’ counsel of record\n. present in the room in a videotaped deposition. Obviously, any inappropriate contact or\ncommunication will certainly be flagged by the atorneys in <span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span>. As such, Plaintiffs\n| really have the cart before the horse in this instance (ie., nothing prevents Epstein from atending\nthese depositions and, to the extent Plaintiffs believe that something improper occurs at any ,\ndeposition, only then can that circumstance be addressed by a motion such as the instant one.)\n44. Next, Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-8, atempt to use the Affidavit of Dr. Kliman for |\n| every motion for protective order/objection filed to date. This also includes the two most recent |\nmotions, which atempt te prevent Defendant’s investigators from doing their job, such that the 2\nDefendant and his atorneys can defend the claims asserted in these cases. Plaintiffs lose sight of 2\nthe fact that the court, in discussing the Non-Prosecution Agreement, inquired as to whether |\nEpstein and his counsel could fully defend the case, which included discovery and investigation. |\nAll plaintiffs’ counsel and the USAO responded in the affirmative. In fact, Plaintiffs universally :\nagreed at the June l2, 2oo9 hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Stay that regular discovery could |\nproceed. See Composite Exhibit “4” at pages 26-3o & 33-34. For instance, the court asked :\nPlaintiffs’ atorneys the follouing questions: |\nThe Court: [] So again, I just want to make sure that if the cases go forward and :\nif Mr. Epstein defends the case as someone ordinarily would defend a case being\nprosecuted against him or her, that that in and of itself is not going to cause himto .\nbe subject to criminal prosecution? (Ex. \"A, p.26). |\n- ‘The Court: You agree he should be able to take the ordinary steps that 2 :\ndefendant in a civil action can take and not be concerned about having to be\nprosecuted?

Though the results of the examination were given to the PBPD and\nthe PBPD was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner in\norder to satisfy itself as to the bona fides of the exam, representatives of the\nPBPD inexplicably declined to atend the meeting and no information\nconcerning the fact of the exam or the results appeared in the Police Report;\nthe probable cause affidavit; or the public release.\n\n2. Meetings with the State Atorney’s Office. On multiple occasions, defense\ncounsel met with prosecutors and investigators in the State Atorney’s Office.\nThough there is vague reference to one or more meetings with defense counsel\n(see, e.g., pages 64 and 87 of the Police Report), virtually no information\nprovided or evidence from witnesses proffered is included in the Police\nReport or probable cause affidavit. Instead, there are misleading or false\nreferences to such meetings. So, for example, at page 64 of the Police Report,\nDet. Recarey claims he atempted to reach ASA Dahlia Weiss on December\n2o, 2oo5, but she was unavailable that day and for the entire week. In fact, on\nDecember l9, 2oo5, Det. Recarey met with ASA Weiss and Epstein defense\natorney Alan Dershouitz ~ a meeting at which Dershouitz provided evidence\nimpeaching EE (sec belou). This evidence included excerpts\nfrom MySpace.com webpage, which is not only unnoted in the Police\nReport, but credited as having been found by Det. Recarey. (Police Report at\npage 65.) In another example, the briefest reference is made to a conversation\nDet. Recarey had on June l, 2oo6, with ASA Belohlavek regarding a meeting\nearlier that day between representatives of the State Atorney’s Office and\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger (Police Report at page 87). Omited are the\ntacts of the meeting (Report at 87): In addition to the presence of other\ndefense counsel, there was in <span class=\"highlight\">atendance</span> both the polygraph expert who\nadministered the examination and a psychiatrist who had performed a rigorous\npsycho-sexual evaluation of Epstein and who concluded that Epstein was\nhealthy. Both men were made available for questioning by the State Atorney\nand the PBPD; unfortunately, the PBPD failed to atend the meeting. Nor is\nthere any mention of the presentation made by defense counsel in which the\nclaims being made with respect oy then, the sole focus of\nany potential prosecution) were rebuted.\n\n3. The Video Surveillance Equipment Located in Epstein’s Office and\nGarage, Both the Police Report (page 43) and the probable cause affidavit\n(page l8) make particular mention of the PBPD having “discovered” video\nsurveillance equipment, or “covert (hidden) cameras” (as the PBPD refers to\nthem), at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, specifically in Epstein’s garage and\nlibrary/office. By its placement in the probable cause affidavit, it is clear that\nthe reader is intended to assume a link between this equipment and “sex\nobjects” and that the cameras were used for an improper purpose. As the\nprobable cause affidavit states: Det. Recarey “located a wood colored armoire\nbeside Epstein’s bed that contained a botle of ‘joy jelly’, which is used to\nprovide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the\nsecond floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom...” Indeed, much is made of the presence of this equipment, noting\n\n2 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332o9\n"};
