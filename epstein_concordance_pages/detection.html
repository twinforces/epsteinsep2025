And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee.

Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo988", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000992.jpg": "Cesed 2o-€f Qo36GosAUut Dibeu tet 22o 2Ft il S@ OF ALG) 26a Geargec8 2Ho9\nappear to depend on any job — or to have depended on any employment in the past 3o years — for\nthe privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo992", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000993.jpg": "Cesed 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Dibeu tet 22o 2Ft il ed OF ALG) 26a Geagecs 2Ho9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo993", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000998.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGuisnt DOM 22o FilesoOAI3o2 aPage aM26lol9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001158.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect 6 Gb 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll58", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001165.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck 3 Ob 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001166.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deagec? 4 Ob 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument.

The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001228.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a geageol J G6 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001280.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutrent l682 lFiKOS3222/2agAaGeor o642\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def.

The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v.

Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case.

And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony\nis corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence.\n(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-l2).

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice.

Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool598", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 4 of l9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001618.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 8 of l9\nappear to depend on any job — or to have depended on any employment in the past 3o years — for\nthe privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001619.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 9 of l9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difference between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l4 of l9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court.

The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

In other words, even though, as defense claims,\n\n2 that she is widely knoun, that there is press everywhere, she\n\n3 was able to pass during the purchase of a real estate\n\n4 transaction under a fake name and not be detected. So there\n\n5 really can be no question that the defendant is willing to lie\n6 about who she is, that she can live in hiding, that she has the\n7 means to do so. All of those things should be extremely\n\n8 concerning to the court, your Honor, as the court evaluates\n\n9 whether the defendant has the ability and willingness to live\nlo off the grid indefinitely. A year is an extremely long period\nll of time to live in hiding, undetected by the public. And so\n\nl2 all of those things are concerning.\n\nl3 With respect to the question of motive, your Honor,\n\nl4 the government submits the court need not reach that ultimate\nl5 issue, but we noted, your Honor, that there are indicia during\nl6 the circumstances of the defendant's arrest that suggested that\nl7 there was a motive to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by law enforcement.

The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance.

Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 23 of 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 24 of 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\n\nthe nou-apparent weakness of its case.”’”)). Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are\ntypically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery.

Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\nintroduce evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\nconsciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\nunsupported inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl4\nthat would confuse the issues in the case and cause undue delay. It should therefore be precluded\nunder Rule 4o3.\n\nBACKGROUD\nThe government repeatedly and erroneously argued in the context of Ms. Maxwell’s bail\napplications that Ms. Maxwell went into “hiding” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein to avoid\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by law enforcement. See 7/2/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Supp. of Detention (Dkt. oo4) at 8\n(“[Ms. Maxwell] made intentional efforts to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>”); 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in\nSupp. of Detention (Dkt. o22) at 8 (measures that Ms. Maxwell took “to conceal herself” after\nEpstein’s indictment “are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by law enforcement”); l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s\nRenewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant\nwas hiding not just from the press, but also from law enforcement.”). The government also\nrepeatedly and erroneously argued that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct at the time of her arrest\nevidenced an intent to evade law enforcement. See 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in Supp. of\nDetention (Dkt. o22) at 7-8; 7/l4/2o2o Tr. of Bail Hrg. at 3l:2o-34:5; l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in\nOpp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l-22.\nThe government’s assertion rests on groundless speculation concerning actions which\nMs. Maxwell was forced to take in the days after Epstein’s arrest to protect herself and her\nfamily and friends from unrelenting harassment by the media and the very real danger of\nphysical threats against them. In particular, the government has noted the follouing in its prior\nsubmissions:\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5692", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87).

The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense.

(Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of 29\n\nPathways to False Allegations 99\nbut not sufficient conditions for false allegations. There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 29\n\nl2o J.

A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 45\n278 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 2o(2)\n\nAdult studies typically had a mean age between 4o and 5o for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure.

Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015225.jpg": "l986\n\nSchooler, J.W., Gerhard, D., & Loftus, E.F.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9893", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019906.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo68oHAEN ISaCuMEent 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPagev26nl9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019910.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8ooBB8oHAEN ISahuMeht 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPaheB26ol9\nappear to depend on any job — or to have depended on any employment in the past 3o years — for\nthe privileged lifestyle she has maintained for the entirety of that period. The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool99lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019911.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8ooB8oHAEN ISACuMEent 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPageb26ol9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof difterence between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her).

The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance.

That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any employment in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current employment. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020083.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8RGHANAt DEctiMero loo2 Filed6R2a38/PgPageP B6af 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020084.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8BGANt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tgPaAgePasaf 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\n<span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020241.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page/ of 25\nAlthough the defense argued that Maxwell did not leave the United States after\nEpstein’s arrest and was in contact with the Government through counsel, Judge\nNathan emphasized that Maxwell “did not provide the government with her\nwhereabouts,” and, in any event, “the reality that Ms. Maxwell may face such serious\ncharges herself may not have set in until after she was actually indicted.” (/d. at 84-\n85).\n\nl4. Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had\ncarried its burden of demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of\nflight” and that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s appearance. (/d. at 86). Though the proposed bail\npackage represented only a fraction of Maxwell’s assets, Judge Nathan found that\n“even a substantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.).

Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for discovery.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v.

Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government proffered the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury. Lafontaine, 2lo F.3d at l3l. The Indictment—which reflects\nfar more than just a proffer but instead the probable cause determination of the grand\njury after receiving evidence—sets forth in detail the expected testimony of three\nvictim-witnesses, describing specific actions Maxwell took with respect to each.\n(Ind. {| 7(a)-(c)). And as the Government explained, each victim-witness’s testimony\nis corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and by documentary evidence.\n(Ex. A at 5; Ex. F at 9-l2). Judge Nathan was entitled to rely on these proffers in\nassessing the strength of the evidence.\n\n36. Maxwell’s remaining arguments repeat contentions made belou\nbut do not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan’s considered rejection of them.\nMaxwell disputes that she was hiding from law enforcement before her arrest (Br.\n23-24), but Judge Nathan was dubious of that assertion and found that even assuming\nMaxwell was hiding from the media, not the Government, her evasive actions\ndemonstrated her “extraordinary capacity to evade <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>.” (Ex.

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (‘OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2323o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023231.jpg": "OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span> of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The Unit Team staff will review the\nrequest, and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit\nTeam’s unmonitored telephones. In order to receive an\nunmonitored atorney call, the inmate or the inmate’s atorney\nmust request Unit Team approval, demonstrating that other\ncorrespondence, visiting, and normal telephone use is inadequate.\nInmate requests for unmonitored atorney calls are carefully\nreviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected.\nFrequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate’s\nopportunity to pursue illegal activities without <span class=\"highlight\">detection</span>.\nAdditionally, staff time and atention is unfairly focused on the\nsingle inmate receiving numerous unmonitored telephone calls at\nthe expense of the many other inmates on a caseload.\n\nPage lo of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23753"};
