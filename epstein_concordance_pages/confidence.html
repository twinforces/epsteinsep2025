Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt.

Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance.

As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested.

(See Def. Ex.

Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”).

(See Exs. A-N, W-X).

As a sign of their <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this\ncountry, the sureties have agreed to sign their oun bonds and to post meaningful pledges of\ncash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.\nMaxwell were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nThese leters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing\nthat Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents [or] significant family ties” to the United\nStates.

As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\n<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

In the S2 Indictment, by\ncontrast, the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three cover a much broader timeframe\nfrom l994-2oo4 because they incorporate the same conduct from 2ool-2oo4 involving Accuser-\n4 charged in Counts Five and Six. As previously discussed, the NPA bars the government from\nprosecuting Ms. Maxwell for these offenses. Hence, as currently charged, the government could\noffer inadmissible evidence excluded by the NPA as proof of Counts One and Three.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\n<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l47 of 349\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex. A at 4). To the extent that Dr. Dietz is pointing to the fact that the term “grooming-by-\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6226", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 4l\ncreates a predicate that a witness has a condition creating such a “pathway.” And even then, as\ndescribed above, it is likely that such an opinion, based on one article, would be unreliable, only\nmarginally helpful to a jury that can understand the relationship between mental illness and truth-\ntelling, and highly prejudicial by having an expert witness testify to the credibility of other\nwitnesses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\n<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more difficult for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3o of 4l\n\n2. “[Hlou memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.”\n\n3. “[T]he mechanism by which false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result\nof post-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence or the like.”\n\n4. “(T]he effects of suggestion on memory,” including hou “[s]uggestive activities can\nexplain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory of sexual abuse, and even denying\nsexual abuse, to later having [memories] for numerous abusive acts, if the memories are false.”\n\n5. “[T] he characteristics of false and/or distorted memories” . . . “[i]n particular,” that:\n\na.

Otherwise it would not be a memory.\n\n3. Opinions Bearing on Witness Credibility and Demeanor\n\nThe follouing opinions by Dr. Loftus invade the province of the jury by atempting to\ninstruct it on hou to assess witness credibility and demeanor:\n\ne Hou an individual with a false memory can describe that memory “with <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, detail\nand emotion,” as described in Paragraph 5(a) above.\ne Hou an individual with a false memory is “not deliberately lying,” as described in\n\nParagraph 5(b) above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from opining on victim or witness credibility, including by\nopining as to hou a victim with an alleged false memory may testify (e.g., confidently) and\ndescribing a victim with an alleged false memory as a “liar” or “not a deliberate liar.’ Such\nopinions would be highly prejudicial and inflammatory, would confuse and mislead the jury, and\nwould invade the fundamental province of the jury in determining witness credibility. See\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d at 288-89 (affirming district court’s exclusion of expert testimony that a\nwitness’s <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> does not correlate to the witness’s factual accuracy in the context of an\nidentification because such testimony “might confuse or mislead the jury”); Shohola, 2ol9 WL\n6o53223, at *lo-l3 (discussing jury’s province of determining witness credibility); Fed. R. Evid.\n4o3. Such opinions, moreover, are effectively defense arguments to be appropriately made during\ndefense summations. To allou Dr. Loftus to testify that a victim is essentially a liar (but may not\nrealize she is a liar) or that a witness may testify confidently even when testifying untruthfully\nwould effectively allou the defense to cloak its arguments under the imprimatur of a purported\nexpert. The Court will instruct the jury on witness credibility. A defense expert should not provide\na dueling instruction.

First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 2\ndescribed with <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, detail, and emotion, just like true memories. This can occur when\npeople come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\n\nTABLE l General Definitions of Grooming\n\nAuthor(s) Definition of Grooming (taken directly from reference)\n\nSgroi (l982) “Hou does [the perpetrator] get the child to participate in some type of\nsexual behavior? Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims. On the forensic side, Dr.\nRocchio takes on “an investigative role” and does not accept claims “at face value.” Nov. lo Tr.\nat l5. But Dr. Dietz’s opinion about evaluating victims’ credibility still has litle relevance to\nDr. Rocchio’s forensic evaluations. In explaining her method, Dr. Rocchio did not say that she\n“‘base[s] her opinions” on victims’ emotional distress. Def. Br. at l4. Rather, she testified that\nshe looks at a significant volume of documentation, conducts an 8 to lo-hour in-person\nevaluation, and “conduct[s] collateral interviews with others.” Nov. lo Tr. at 37-38.

In\nsum, Dr. Dietz’s opinion of determining witnesses’ credibility has litle relevance to rebut or\n“critique” Dr. Rocchio’s methods. Def. Br. at l3.\n\nSecond, there is a significant risk of prejudice. As explained, expert testimony that\nevaluates witnesses’ credibility is inadmissible. For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin\naffirmed the exclusion of an expert opinion that a witness’s “<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in identification is not a\ngood predictor of accuracy” because it “would effectively have inserted [the expert’s] oun view\nof the [testifying witness’s] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.” l92\nF.3d at 288-89.

As\npart of this last opinion, the notice states that “Dr. Loftus would identify some of the suggestive\nactivities that occurred in the current case.” /d. at 2.\n\nThe Government seeks to exclude most or all of these opinions because they are\nunreliable, fall within the ken of the jury, impermissibly bear on witness credibility, or act as\nvehicles for factual narratives of the case.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring.

Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express exception.

(See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the\nlawyer will have satisfied the lawyer’s obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be\nsubject to discipline.\n\nInforming client that disclosure has been made; termination of the lawyer-client\nrelationship\n[ll] When a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions\nCode section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary\ncases the relationship between lawyer and client that is based on trust and <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>\nwill have deteriorated so as to make the lawyer’s representation of the client impossible.\nTherefore, when the relationship has deteriorated because of the lawyer’s disclosure,\nthe lawyer is required to seek to withdraw from the representation, unless the client has\ngiven informed consent* to the lawyer’s continued representation.

The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs\n\nMs. Feldman’s declaration explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the\nEVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly difficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such\ndeeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had\non their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in individuals in\npositions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not\nfeel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply\nwould not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.\nFeldman by victims’ atorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to\nparticipate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of\nconfidentiality.”*?\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program. As Ms.\nFeldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very\nfoundation and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?\nCompelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be\n“anathema to the integrity of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its\nhead with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the\nEVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim\ncompensation programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an\n9 See Ex.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page4of7\nby the Estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum.

That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with\nmultiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions\non these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with\nMs. Maxwell, seemimgly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants\nto provide. Houever, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell\nis bemg legitimized in public discourse has already resulted im re-traumatization.\n\ne ‘Transfer to a Louer-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a louer-security prison\nhas further eroded the victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that their safety and dignity are priorities. The\ntransfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and\nwithout explanation—actions they see as extraordinarily insensitive and suggestive of\nulterior purposes.\n\ne Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a\nstep required by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.).\nThat case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose\nprecisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very\nsame victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the\ngovernment has once again proceeded m a manner that disregards the victums’ rights—\nsuggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission\nreinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current\nadministration.\n\ne Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with\nthe transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency.

The Court has not considered them in resolving the motion to unseal.\n\nll. The Systemic Interest in Grand Jury Secrecy\n\nA final consideration is systemic. “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system\ndepends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 2l8. For\nthat reason, the Supreme Court has instructed louer courts “considering the effects of disclosure\non grand jury proceedings” to assess “the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand\njuries,” mindful that “[p]ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their\ntestimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties.” /d. at 222; see also Procter & Gamble\nCo., 356 U.S. at 682 (“The grand jury as a public institution serving the community might suffer\nif those testifying today knew that the secrecy of their testimony would be lifted tomorrou.”);\nBaker v. U.S. Steel Corp., 492 F.2d lo74, lo76 n.2 (2d Cir. l974) (similar).\n\n'8 These include the Government’s decision, while pursuing release of the grand jury materials,\nto not publicly release further records from its investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, see, e.g.,\nDkt. 8o4 at 9 (noting “the much larger volume of information available in the ‘more than 3oo\ngigabytes of data and physical evidence’ in the Government’s possession that should be\ndisclosed as well”); its “suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming,” id.\nat 8; its not having given notice to victims before it filed the instant motion to unseal, id. at 8, l6,\n2l; its transfer of Maxwell to a louer security prison, which, a leter states, “has further eroded\nthe victims’ <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that their safety and dignity are priorities,” id. at l5; the possibility that\nMaxwell might receive clemency, id. at l5—l6; and the DAG’s decision to meet with Maxwell\n“as though she were a credible authority,” which, one leter states, has publicly “legitimiz[ed]\nher,” id. at l5; see also id. at 2o.\n\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special circumstances”\nexception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the exception casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted disclosure in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015230.jpg": "Loftus, E.F.

Outside of the laboratory, is there any way of proving that\n2 someone has an actual memory?\n\n3 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.\n\n4 THE COURT: Sustained.\n\n5 Q. Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones\n\n8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you knou, the\n\n9 core of what happened. You knou that what you saw was a plane\nlo crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but\nll even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event\n\nl2 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.\nl3 Q. In the course of your research and experience, have you\n\nl4 done any experiments that have studied the <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> of\n\nl5 memory?\n\nl6 A. Yes.\n\nl7 Q. Can you please explain that to the jury.\n\nl8 A. Oftentimes, at retrieval, when somebody is answering a\n\nl9 question or reporting on what they remember from an event, they\n2o might be asked to express the level of <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, you knou,\n2l I'm prety sure it happened, I'm very sure or what have you.\n22 And one of the things we knou is if the conditions are very\n23 pristine, not a lot of -- not a lot of suggestion, not a long\n24 period of time, they're a fair test, people are more accurate\n25 when they're confident than when they're not confident.

So going back, actually, to the typical eyewitness study,\nll witnesses see an accident, they really saw the car go through a\nl2 stop sign. Later on, you suggest it was a yield sign and many\nl3 people will succumb to the suggestion. You have changed a\n\nl4 detail in memory for an event that actually happened.\n\nl5 But somewhere around the l99os, researchers from\n\nl6 around the world started to look at, could you plant an entire\nl7 event into the minds of people for something that didn't\n\nl8 happen, could you use enough suggestion that you would get\n\nl9 people to construct whole events, and we and others have\n2o accomplished that, meaning other scientific laboratories,\nal planting false memories that -- well, as I mentioned, you\n22 witnessed your parents have a physically violent fight or you\n23 were atacked by a vicious animal, or you had a serious indoor\n24 or outdoor accident, or you nearly drouned and had to be\n25 rescued by a lifeguard, or you commited a crime as a teenager\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool66l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l53 of 246 2448\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl THE COURT: Thank you, everyone.

Professor Loftus, before we broke for lunch, I was asking\n\n9 you, had you been involved in any research that dealt with the\nlo correlation between the certainty of <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that one has\n\nll and whether the memory itself is accurate.

Yes.\n\nl6 Q. Can you please explain what that means to the jury.\n\nl7 A. People can express a level of <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> and if they then\nl8 get some new information, for example, confirming information,\nl9 something that confirms their recollection, it can increase --\n2o sort of artificially increase their <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in what they're\n2l saying.\n22 So, for example, in some research, primarily research\n23 done by one of the most prominent people in this field,\n24 Professor Wells from Ioua State, individuals would make an\n25 identification at a lineup and then be told -- and express some\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6636", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l54 of 246 2449\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> like, I am prety sure that's the guy.

So there\nl2 are studies shouing that people remember their grades were\nl3 beter than they really were, that they voted in elections they\nl4 didn't vote in, that they gave more to cater than they really\nl5 gave, that their kids walked and talked at an earlier age than\nl6 they really did. These are prestige enhancing memory\nl7 distortions that people routinely make when they're not\nl8 deliberately lying, but maybe it makes them feel a litle\nl9 beter about themselves.\n\n2o (Continued on next page)\n2l\n22\n23\n24\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6637", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l47 of 257 298l\nLCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl government asking you four times, Are you sure there was no\n\n2 sexual abuse in New Mexico?

(See Exs. A-N, W-X).

A Number of Ms. Maxwell’s Family and Friends, and the Security\nCompany Protecting Her, Are Prepared to Sign Significant Bonds\n\nIn addition to her spouse, a number of Ms. Maxwell’s family members and friends,\nmany of whom are US. citizens and residents, have volunteered to step forward as co-\nsigners.

The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020221.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdi BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di3l66l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\nnecessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020223.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivent DecyMdl BA62 Filke62o6/PhgPeye di5l66l6\n\nline by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be\nunavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has\nbeen, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the\nDaubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly\nshifting, meaning that the defense team will have litle to no ability to confidently predict when\nthey will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County\nDetention Center fares no beter. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states\nthat “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person\natorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at l (emphasis added). Later, the\ngovernment writes that the jail is willing to allou in-person meetings, but that it will “work to\naccommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his atorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).\nRather than inspire <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of\nuncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdoun at any\ntime due to the continued spread of COVID-l9 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more\ninfectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of\nCOVID-l9 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety\npractices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the\nconsistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense atorneys that he needs.\n\nFinally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier\nrelease order. Doc. 3oo. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for\nsuch a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority\nin support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020297.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page? of 3o\nerroneously adopted its conclusory proffer.\n\n5.

Of course she took measures to\nprotect herself and her family, just as government lawyers and judges do\nwhen their safety is at issue. Ms. Maxwell was at her home in the United\nStates.

Should the jury convict on this\nbasis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count\nFour. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly\nengaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in\nCount Four. See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-ll (finding constructive amendment where\nindictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at\ntrial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any\nsexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at\ntrial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2o. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive\namendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a shouing\nof prejudice. United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nAt the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged\nsexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2\nIndictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The\nCourt should instruct the jury as requested belou to prevent such a variance from occurring.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\n<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021222.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EAS 3536o38, Page5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that the two key victims “‘will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021320.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4G 3536o38, Pagel48 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\nIl. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision.

Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 678 (l985). “The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all\nthe evidence in the Government’s possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of\nhis defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only\nknoun to the Government.” United States v.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\n<span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span>. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023060.jpg": "also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n43 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\na Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023158.jpg": "affirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\nIl. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8’ The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl.

Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023320.jpg": "to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\nca In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023324.jpg": "OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ...

But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating 2 plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\nEpstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the <span class=\"highlight\">confidence</span> that comes with the pouer to\ndazzie and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah.” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdiy\n“He lives ina different environment,” says Sicgal. “He's of this world.
