The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court.

Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool39o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001391.jpg": "Castas2oicr-oo3BoAuNenDoCuitd h8 2o2 l FAeaMese5Ragerags 3of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool39l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001705.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page l of 6\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Menon rien\nwww.cohen gressencom\nMark S.

First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old.

Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial production” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its production of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first production until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] protective order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust lo, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nDistrict courts have the inherent authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses. See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 886 Filed o8/lo/2o Page l of 6\n8oo Third Avenue\n\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Menon rien\nMark $.

It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 88 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial production” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its production of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first production until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] protective order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 88 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 2 of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def.

For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 2 of 5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way.

Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974) (“[A]n indictment is sufficient if it,\nfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge\nagainst which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquital or conviction in bar\nof future prosecutions for the same offense.”); Fed.R.Crim.P.7(c). An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings.

The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v.

The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)).

Despite repeated requests, the government refuses to produce any\nevidence. Without knouing the who, what, when, and why of these allegations, the task of\nidentifying dead and missing witnesses, percipient witness, travel records, phone records, or\ntemporally relevant documents is challenging and limited by the vagueness of the claims. For\nexample, the government produced part of its voluminous 2oo6 investigative case file\nconceming these issues. The names of the alleged witnesses, the agents who conducted the\ninterviews and the agents who conducted the investigation are, houever, redacted. Ms. Maxwell\nhas no ability to conclusively identify these individuals much less interview them and therefore\ncannot represent to the Court whether they are alive, remember anything, or have useful\nevidence.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2545", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002618.jpg": "~ Case l:lo Cease BRO nSCo388cWwhenPEantanbidd dh Fillsh GR4ORE DS Aageod Of Hage 7 of l5\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is\nmaterial to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach\nof any one of these conditions allous the United States to elect to terminate the agreement\nand to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all\nfederal offenses.\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that\nthe Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal\nprosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.

Epstein hereby agrees\nand consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the\nsubject of the grand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed\nby the United States Atorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as\n. to any such offense.\nffl\nfi\nfil\nPage 6 of 7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l4\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n” 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2639", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v.

That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> suspected criminal activity”).

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 23\nin court conferences, in lawsuits, and in the press. Without this basic information, Ms. Maxwell\ncannot adequately <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the allegations against her and prepare for trial.\n\nThe voluminous discovery provided by the government, which totals in the millions of\npages—the vast majority of which was produced to the defense in November 2o2o—does not\nshed any more light on the nature of the government proof or the specifics of the alleged\nconduct.” The discovery contains only a handful of documents that even pertain to the time\nperiod charged in the indictment (l994-l997), and what litle exists offers almost no information\nabout the details of, for example, exactly when and where the alleged incidents of sexual abuse\ntook place, who was allegedly present, and hou the alleged conduct violated the law. Without\nthese details, which Ms. Maxwell is requesting through a bill of particulars, she cannot identify\nrelevant witnesses or documents that she may wish to obtain to prepare her defense.\n\nIt is clear that the detail about hou these alleged offenses took place will come solely\nfrom the statements of the government’s witnesses. Accordingly, it is critical that Ms. Maxwell\nreceive Jencks Act material and the government’s witness list, as well as 4o4(b) evidence, well\nin advance of trial so that she can conduct an adequate investigation. The unique circumstances\nof this case more than warrant early disclosure of this material. The conduct alleged in the\nindictment dates back 25 years, making investigation and preparation of the case complex and\ndifficult. The global COVID-l9 pandemic adds further complications and obstacles to trial\npreparation. The Court has recognized that Ms. Maxwell should be granted ample time to\nreview documents related to witnesses in this case. (See Dkt. 73 (ordering the government to\nproduce documents related to certain non-testifying witnesses by March l2, 2o2l “to ensure that\n* Ms. Maxwell is still reviewing the discovery, including the over two million pages produced in November 2o2o.\nIn deference to the Court’s schedule and in light of the trial date, we have not asked the Court to further extend the\ndeadline to file pretrial motions. Houever, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to supplement these motions at a later\ndate if her review of discovery uncovers documents that warrant additional requests.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2699", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 23\nthe defense can adequately prepare for trial”)). For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a bill\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a Bill of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A bill of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with\nsufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574\n(2d Cir. l987). The decision of whether to grant a bill of particulars is within the discretion of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\nthe district court. /d. “In deciding whether a bill of particulars is needed, the court must\ndetermine whether the information sought has been provided elsewhere, such as in other items\nprovided by discovery, responses made to requests for particulars, prior proceedings, and the\nindictment itself.” United States v. Strawberry, 892 F. Supp. 5l9, 526 (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not\nknouing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not knou who\nhas accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here. See\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975);° United States v. Warme, No.\nO9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose\nidentity of sex crime victim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against\nthis charge is significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim’). On August 25, 2o2o, the Court denied as premature our request that the government be\nordered to provide the identities of the three accusers. (Dkt. 49). We have conferred with the\n>In Cannone, the Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s order to compel disclosure of\nwitness identities under the circumstances of that case. 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Nevertheless, Cannone recognized the\ndistrict courts’ ability to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses in appropriate cases. /d at 3ol.\nHere, the unique circumstances of this case warrant the disclosure of the accusers’ identities.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 23\nimmediately disclose all potentially favorable evidence having a reasonable probability to\naffect the outcome of the proceedings. It is further requested that the Court direct the\ngovernment to disclose such information immediately upon its discovery.\n\nIt is well setled that pursuant to Brady and its progeny, the government must\ndisclose evidence, information, and facts that could be used to impeach its witnesses. See\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 225 (2d Cir. 2oo7). Such evidence includes any\nand all evidence of a witness’ prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent\nstatements, and statements demonstrating a lack of knouledge or a denial of the facts of the\ncase or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct from which it\ncan be inferred the witness is untruthful.\n\nBut disclosure of Brady material is not the end of the line. Quite the contrary, it is a\nlaunching point for an investigation that may bear critical information. In order to mount an\neffective defense, Ms. Maxwell must receive this material in sufficient time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>\nand develop it for effective use before and during trial. We therefore request the immediate\ndisclosure of all Brady and Giglio material.\n\nThe government takes the customary position that it will turn over any Gig/io material at\nthe time it provides prior statements of witnesses pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. In doing so, the\ngovernment erroneously assumes that Gig/io material is something other than Brady material.\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that impeachment evidence “falls within the Brady rule.”\nBagley, 473 U.S. at 676 (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54).

Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974). The circumstances of this case — the age of the offenses, the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l9 of 23\nlocation of witnesses, the ongoing global pandemic — justify the accelerated disclosure of Jencks\nAct material.\n\nThe Court has already recognized that the defense will need substantial time to evaluate\nand <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> materials related to potential witnesses in this case. In response to the\ngovernment request to delay production of certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses until eight weeks prior to trial, the Court ruled that such a time frame was\n“insufficient” and ordered the government to produce the materials by March l2, 2o2l “to\nensure that the defense can adequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). The defense has conferred\nwith the government and proposed the same date—March l2, 2o2l—+to produce all Jencks Act\nmaterial for both testifying and non-testifying witnesses. The government has denied that\nrequest. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the government to disclose all Jencks Act\nmaterial by that date, including, but not limited to the follouing:\n\nl. Any and all rough notes of witness interviews taken or obtained in any investigation\nof Ms. Maxwell, including federal, state, local and other investigations whether or not\nthe contents thereof have been incorporated in official reports;\n\n2. Any notes or memoranda made by government counsel, staff, or law enforcement\nagents during the interview of any witness intended to be called by the government in\nits direct case;\n\n3. Any emails, texts or voicemails (in original, transcribed and summary form) from the\nwitness and from the witness’s counsel/law firm containing information derived from\nany witness intended to be called by the government in its direct case; and\n\n4. Any emails, texts or voicemails (in original, transcribed and summary form) between\nand among government counsel and law enforcement officers containing information\nderived from any witness intended to be called by the government in its direct case.\n\nVI. Motion for a List of Government Witnesses\n\nIn conjunction with Ms. Maxwell’s request for early disclosure of Jencks Act material,\nthe defense also requests that the government provide a list of the witnesses it intends to call at\ntrial. Although Rule l6 does not require the government to disclose its witness prior to trial, the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 23\nCourt may order the disclosure when a balancing of the defendant’s need for disclosure and the\ngovernment's need for concealment indicates that such an order would be in the interests of\nJustice. See Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Trial courts generally exercise discretion to order\nsuch disclosure upon a finding that a defendant’s request is material to the preparation of the case\nand is otherwise reasonable. See id. at 3oo-ol. Courts assess the materiality and reasonableness\nof the request through the application of a six-factor test set forth in United States v. Turkish, 458\nF. Supp. 874 (S.D.N.Y. l978):\n\nl. Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence?\n\n2. Have the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence?\n\n3. Will the evidence in the case largely consist of testimony relating to documents\n\n(which by their nature are not easily altered)?\n\n4. Is there a realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will\nincrease the likelihood that the prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or\nwill be unwilling to testify at trial?\n\n5. Does the indictment allege offenses occurring over an extended period of time,\nmaking preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?\n\n6.

Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2926", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 3 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“[O]f the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2927", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 239\nto the instant prosecution, is insufficient to shou actual prejudice. .. . The fact that evidence may\nbe lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment stage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the\nduration. Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the destruction of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate pre-trial\npublicity from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation. The defendant\ncites not one case in support of her argument that pre-trial publicity can ever establish actual\nprejudice, nor does she point to any evidence that the Government fomented such publicity dating\nback to 2oll. To the extent the defendant is concerned about pretrial publicity, she will have the\nopportunity to propose an appropriate examination of potential jurors during voir dire to identify\na panel of impartial jurors who have not been prejudiced by any publicity this case may have\ngarnered.\n\nIn short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,\nspeculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay.'!? The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide discovery adequate\nto fully <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in discovery are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment. (/d.). As described herein,\nsee Section X, infra, the Government has made substantial discovery productions pursuant to Rule\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003019.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 239\nparticular, this mater appears to be the only remaining active civil case in this District in which\nclaims against Ghislaine Maxwell have been asserted.” (2o Civ. 484 (DCF) (JGK), Dkt. No. 8o\nat 2). The defendant’s baseless conjecture about the Government’s supposedly nefarious reasons\nfor delaying her prosecution are not sufficient to support a dismissal of the Indictment. The\ndefendant ignores the fact that cases such as this one take time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and indict.\n\nThe defendant also suggests that the Government engaged in reckless disregard of\ncircumstances that would likely impede her ability to mount an effective defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at\n5-6, l5). As an initial mater, this argument falls short of “a standard that requires a shouing of\nintentionality.” United States v. Wey, No. l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *l3 n.8\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l8, 2ol7).24_ While this Court in Wey did not foreclose the possibility of\nrecklessness sufficing under certain circumstances, much as in Wey, “the instant case does not\nrequire this Court to pass on the issue,” id., because there is no evidence of recklessness in this\ncase. To the contrary, as detailed above, the Government acted promptly in bringing criminal\ncharges shortly after two key victims whose testimony helped give rise to those charges first agreed\nto speak with law enforcement. Baseless speculation aside, the defendant offers no argument or\nevidence as to hou or why the Government acted recklessly here.\n\nIn sum, not only does the defendant fail to demonstrate actual, non-speculative prejudice\nouing to pre-indictment delay, but she also fails to establish that the Government intentionally\n4 This Court has noted “some disagreement among the district courts in this Circuit as to whether\nreckless—as opposed to intentional—disregard of circumstances . . . may support a due process\nchallenge based on pre-indictment delay,” but concluded that “the pertinent decisions [], on\nbalance, more plainly comport with a standard that requires a shouing of intentionality.” Wey,\n2ol7 WL 23765l, at *l3 n.8 (citing Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (defendant bears burden of shouing\nthat “delay was a course intentionally pursued by the government for an improper purpose”)\n(emphasis added)); see also United States v.

(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003073.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 239\n“misstatements” to Chief Judge McMahon and the extent of coordination between the USAO-\nSDNY and Boies Schiller prior to the issuance of the subpoena. (Def. Mot. 3 at l6). With respect\nto that alleged “misconduct,” the defendant appears to makes two general accusations: first, that\nin 2ol6 Boies Schiller encouraged the USAO-SDNY to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the defendant for perjury, and\nsecond, that the Government’s statement to Chief Judge McMahon as to whether she was facing a\n“Chemical Bank kind of situation” was false. Neither is correct, for the reasons described above.\nBecause the defendant has proffered no reliable evidence to support any of the accusations\ncontained in her motion papers, and because the Government has responded to those accusations\nwith AUSA-l’s contemporaneous notes of the February 29, 2ol6 meeting and notes from an\ninterview of AUSA-l conducted by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI (see Exs. 4 & 5), as well as\nrelevant AUSA-l emails (Exs. 6 & 7), such a hearing is not warranted.\n\na.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 348\nlil.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 42 of 348\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO <span class=\"highlight\">INVESTIGATE</span> EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case. °°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 325 of 348\n\n3.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\nJustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case.

Sean never\ncalled AK back. AK doesn’t recall ever affirmatively follouing up with Sean, but she\ntook the radio silence to mean that the FBI agents in Florida did not express\ndissatisfaction.\n\ne No investigation was opened as a result of the February 29, 2ol6 meeting.\n\ne No investigation into Epstein was opened while AK was the Human Trafficking\nCoordinator and Project Safe Childhood coordinator.\n\ne AK never met with any other Boies Schiller atorneys. AK does not recall ever speaking\nwith David Boies at any point.\n\ne AK never met with the atorneys from the February 29, 2ol6 meeting again.\n\ne When asked what, if any, communications AK had with the atorneys, AK noted that she\nsees an email from May 2ol6 with Stan Potenger. AK believes it’s possible Stan called\nAK, but she does not remember that.\n\ne AK does not recall any further conversations re Epstein in SDNY until much later when\nthe Miami Herald series was published.\n\nAK confirmed she has read the Daily News Article LP sent\n\ne AK indicated that the article did not accurately describe AK’s interactions with atorneys\nfor Virginia Roberts.\n\ne AK’s recollection is not that atorneys urged SDNY to open an investigation into “the\nduo.” They were focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned in passing, not as a target.\n\ne AK did not participate in a second meeting with anyone. Had there been a meeting on\nthis subject in the summer of 2ol6 in SDNY, AK would have knoun about it in her\ncapacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\no AK had been in that role since approximately 2olo, and if someone came in to\nmeet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking mater, AK would get\ncontacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any\ncases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate. So\nif a second meeting had taken place with a supervisor in the office, AK would\nhave knoun about it. Dan Stein also would have brought AK in if he learned of a\nsecond meeting.\n\no AK would have made a record if there had ever been a second meeting. AK\nwould remember if there were a second meeting. She has no record and no\nmemory of any second meeting.\n\ne AK does not recall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life, so to her\nknouledge, Boies was not making any effort to persuade SDNY to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Epstein.\nAK noted it is possible Boies could have been on the phone if Stan Potinger called AK\nin or around May of 2ol6, but AK has no recollection of such a call.\n\ne AK does not recall the atorney presentation being framed on highlighting Maxwell’s\nassistance with Epstein’s sexual abuse. It was not presented as a “duo.” AK recalls the\nmention of a pilot and the mention of someone having an address book, so other people\nwere mentioned as part of telling the story of Epstein.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3528", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”).

Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict.

Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal.

It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285 (2d\nCir. l99l); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 2l9 F.3d l75, l82—84 (2d Cir.2ooo); Granite\nPartners, L.P. v.

Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely\nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial\ndelay.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to\nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until\nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this mater, including, but not limited\nto any alleged F.R.E. 4o4(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nApp.-o823\n9\nG4LMGIUC\n\nl review so you are aware of the ongoing investigation.

Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page8sof8\nThe Hon.

The government’s\nhyperbole about the alleged confidential nature of the diary is inaccurate, and in any event,\nBoies Schiller is capable or raising confidentiality and requesting a protective order where\napplicable. Of course, to the extent any of the information is legitimately confidential, Ms.\nMaxwell will not object to an appropriate protective order negotiated between the third party\nand Ms. Maxwell and approved by the Court.\nVI. Conclusion\n\nThe government could easily address the issues raised in its April 5, 2o2l leter by\nsimply obtaining the relevant exculpatory evidence. But it refuses to fairly <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> this\ncase, and it should not be permited to interfere with the defense function. Accordingly, the\nvarious requests made in its leter motion should be denied.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nJ b Sond\nCC: Counsel of Record\nDOJ-OGR-oooo386o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nparticular to the time period covered by the S2 Indictment, especially with the guidance provided\nby the Government regarding key documents relevant to Minor Victim-4. Given that the largest\nportion of the discovery in this case is text searchable, the defense will also be able to tailor any\nre-review of those materials through relevant search terms. The combination of having already\npossessed the relevant discovery for months and receiving a list of key documents should\nmeaningfully assist the defense in preparing for trial as scheduled.\n\nThe Government has also commited to providing further disclosures well in advance of\ntrial and far earlier than such productions would ordinarily be made in this District. The\nGovernment has already begun producing materials relating to witnesses whom it does not intend\nto call at trial to the defense, more than three months in advance of trial. The bulk of those\nmaterials were produced on April l3, 2o2l, and the Government intends to make additional\nproductions on a rolling basis as it continues to review its files for such materials. In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this production with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted throughout the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall production. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page 7 of lo\nPage 7\nat trial. Simply put, the defense does not need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> crimes with which the defendant is\nnot charged.\n\nMoreover, the defense’s most recent leter refers to these materials as somehou\nconstituting Brady material without any explanation of what information within the most recent\nproduction is supposedly exculpatory. But given that, as noted above, a significant majority of the\nnon-testifying witness materials do not reference the defendant, to the extent the defense is\nsuggesting that the existence of victims who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein without assistance\nfrom the defendant constitutes Brady material, the Government has repeatedly noted that such\nevidence is not exculpatory. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 65 at l-2; Dkt. No. 2o4 at 47-48 (citing, inter\nalia, United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A defendant may not seek to\nestablish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal acts on specific\noccasions.”’))). Regardless, the defense has ample time to review these materials in advance of\ntrial, and the Government intended to produce all of these materials to the defense with or without\na superseding indictment.* Thus, the defense would have needed to review and <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> these\nmaterials even if the Government never obtained the S2 Indictment. Although the defense claims\n4 The Government understands from defense counsel that the CD containing a copy of this\nproduction, which the Government sent to the MDC via FedEx overnight shipping last week, has\nnot been provided to the defendant. The Government has repeatedly asked MDC legal counsel to\nlocate this CD and provide it to the defendant, and today MDC legal counsel confirmed that the\nCD would be delivered to the defendant this afternoon.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has gone to significant lengths to address the technical\nissues defense counsel have raised with respect to the discovery, and to ensure that the defendant\nexpeditiously receives copies of each production. Indeed, in November 2o2o, the undersigned\nhand delivered a laptop and discovery production to the MDC for the defendant, and the\nGovernment understands the defendant received those items that same day. Although it is not\nfeasible for the Government to hand deliver every production to the MDC, the Government has\ninformed defense counsel that the undersigned will hand deliver the Government’s first production\nof Giglio and Jencks Act material to the MDC to minimize any delay in the defendant’s ability to\naccess that material when it is produced.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3949", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page8ofl3\nThe Hon.

Defense interviews are necessary because of the government’s continued\nrefusal to affirmatively <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> exculpatory evidence. Of the 3o2s reviewed by defense\ncounsel a pervasive tactic has emerged: as soon as the witness begins to provide information\nhelpful to the defense the interview is terminated by the government. Had the government asked\nlogical follou-up questions defense interviews might not be necessary.\n\nThe government has had years to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> these allegations (dating decades ago, from\nl994-2oo4) using the enormous resources at its disposal, including multiple grand juries, scores\nof agents, and teams of prosecutors.

The new charges require additional defense investigation and preparation.\n\nDozens of the statements produced support Ms. Maxwell’s defense and will require\nfurther defense investigation.

In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to\nsupplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P l2 motions relating to\nthe second superseding indictment. After reviewing the “new” discovery, Ms. Maxwell\nanticipates that she will file motions in limine related to the government’s alleged FRE 4o4(b)\nevidence and the government’s proposed exhibits, FRE 7o2 challenges to purported expert\ntestimony, and motions concerning jury selection and change of venue. In addition, expert\ndisclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the “new”\ndiscovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along\nwith the late disclosure of Brady material and failure to provide the discovery to Ms. Maxwell\nhave delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that\nwould normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings. Simply stated, Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel cannot perform all of the necessary tasks in the time remaining before July l2, 2o2l.\n\nII. Requested Relief\nIn United States v.

All the government did in response to Maxwell’s Motion was\ntelephone AUSA JY The government apparently: (l) did not search its system for any and all emails\nfrom, to, or about David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Stan Potinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and\n(2) did not interview anyone other than AUSA gg, such as the other atendees of the meeting\n(Potinger, Edwards, and Skinner), or any of the other AUSAs whom AUSA ggg talked to about her\ncontacts with Giuffre’s atorneys.\n\nMost conspicuous, of course, is the government’s failure to interview AUSA J or secure\nan affidavit from him. If this Court does not grant Maxwell’s Motion on the papers, only an evidentiary\nhearing can address these issues.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l5 of 34\n\nFrom any perspective, therefore, AUSA JJ 2o2l version of events is not worthy of\ncredence, nor is the government’s Response to Maxwell’s Motion, which adopts AUSA\nHE «Vcrsion of events (to the extent she claims to remember them) while ignoring the\ncontemporaneous evidence of what actually happened.

Resp. at 63. Again,\nthe documentary evidence belies this claim.\n\nFirst, AUSA JJ contemporaneous notes say that “Giuffre wants prosecution.” Ex.\nJ, p 7. AUSA J knew what Giuffre’s atorneys were after, which is why she emailed the\nChief of the Criminal Division just days after the meeting to discuss the “intriguing” case, Ex.\nM.\n\nSecond, in the 2o2l interview with prosecutors, AUSA J did not deny that\nGiuffre’s atorneys asked her to consider a perjury prosecution. Ex. K, p 5. Instead, AUSA\nHE said that she “does not remember one way or the other if any of the atorneys referenced\nthe possibility of perjury.” Jd.\n\n” There are other indications as well that Giuffre’s atorneys pressed AUSA yg to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>\nMaxwell.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls.

The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein.

The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time).

Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved.

Had there been a meeting on\nthis subject in the summer of 2ol6 in SDNY, AK would have knoun about it in her\ncapacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\no AK had been in that role since approximately 2olo, and if someone came in to\nmeet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking mater, AK would get\ncontacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any\ncases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate.

AK\nwould remember if there were a second meeting.

Nor can she make appropriate motions to preclude the\ngovernment’s use of this evidence, as it falls outside of the scope of the charged conspiracies.\nMoreover, the government continues to refuse to provide Ms. Maxwell the most basic piece of\ninformation she needs to prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo423l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page6ofl6\nl. The Court Should Grant a Bill of Particulars.\n\nA bill of particulars is appropriate if the indictment does not disclose to the defendant\nwith sufficient particularity “the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy\nshould he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987). Here, the revelation of new allegations from Accuser-3 disclosed\nfor the first time in the government’s opposition, as well as the government’s continuing refusal\nto identify the names of the three accusers, justify the need for a bill of particulars to prevent\nunfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nFirst, as it has done since the beginning of this case, the government continues to deny\nMs. Maxwell the most basic piece of information she needs to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the allegations against\nher and prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused her of the crimes\ncharged in the Indictment. Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have sufficient time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining anonymous.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a bill of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl6\nThese new allegations—which expand the nature and scope of the charged\nconspiracies—are exactly the type of “surprise” revelations that a bill of particulars is designed\nto protect against. The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case. The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its opposition, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are sufficient for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment. (Opp. l79-8l). “The Government [does]\nnot fulfill its obligation merely by providing mountains of documents to defense counsel” if the\ndiscovery does not identify the alleged criminal conduct.” Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575; see also\nUnited States v.

(Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v. Savin, No. oo-CR-45 (RWS), 2ool WL 243533, *7-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7,\n2ool) (disclosure ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses). Third, for each witness identified, the defense will\nneed to search through the over 2.7 million pages of discovery to identify any relevant\ndocuments for cross-examination. The task is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming, as\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl6\nthe vast majority of the discovery was produced as a “dump” of data from Epstein’s various\nelectronic devices, which includes hundreds of thousands of photographs, videos, and other files\nthat are not text searchable. See Rueb, 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (disclosure ordered where\ndefendant needed to review voluminous documentary evidence to prepare cross-examination).\nFourth, investigation of witness statements will face challenges and delays in light of the\ncontinuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-l9 pandemic and the reluctance of\nwitnesses to meet in person.\n\nBy contrast, the “possible dangers accompanying disclosure (i.e. subornation of perjury,\nwitness intimidation, and injury to witnesses)” are non-existent in this case. Cannone, 528 F.2d\nat 3o2. Indeed, the government does not even atempt to argue that Ms. Maxwell, who is\ncurrently incarcerated, will atempt to threaten or intimidate witnesses if she is given their names.\nAccordingly, early disclosure of the identities of the government’s witnesses is warranted.\n\nFor these same reasons, the Court should order the government to provide early\ndisclosure of any and all evidence of “other acts” that it intends to introduce under Rule 4o4(b).\nThe allegations in the Indictment already include conduct that purportedly took place in locations\nall over the United States and in England. Moreover, the government just disclosed in its\nopposition that it intends to have Accuser-3 testify about Ps\n[| that are not alleged in the Indictment and that PO\nee\n| | (Opp. l59). The government may seek to introduce evidence of “other acts” that took\nplace in new locations and possibly other foreign countries. Ms. Maxwell will not have\nsufficient time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> these allegations if she is not given adequate notice and therefore\nmust be given accelerated disclosure of all Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4238", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nFinally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its\ntestifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). For the reasons set forth above, the Court should order\nthe production of all of the requested materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nWil. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Production and Inspection of\n\nDocuments.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening brief identified several redacted or incomplete documents that\nwere produced in discovery, and documents that were omited from discovery, that are subject to\ndisclosure pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations.

The government\nrepresents that it has reviewed the documents and they do not contain any Brady material apart\nfrom one statement that the government nou discloses in its opposition, or that it is under no\n> The government has offered to provide any co-conspirator statements it intends to introduce at trial at the same\ntime that it provides its Jencks Act disclosures.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 349\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7 of 349\nlil.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 43 of 349\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nWi. THE FBI AND THE USAO <span class=\"highlight\">INVESTIGATE</span> EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 69 of 349\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position. I am also quite confident that no one\n66 Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4366", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4o of 349\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27o of 349\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l4 of 349\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name.

The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine.

And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\nrelevance requirement.

For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 27 |\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThe term “extraordinary circumstances” is not well defined.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case.

AK does not recall ever speaking\nwith David Boies at any point.\n\ne AK never met with the atorneys from the February 29, 2ol6 meeting again.\n\ne When asked what, if any, communications AK had with the atorneys, AK noted that she\nsees an email from May 2ol6 with Stan Potenger. AK believes it’s possible Stan called\nAK, but she does not remember that.\n\ne AK does not recall any further conversations re Epstein in SDNY until much later when\nthe Miami Herald series was published.\n\nAK confirmed she has read the Daily News Article LP sent\n\ne AK indicated that the article did not accurately describe AK’s interactions with atorneys\nfor Virginia Roberts.\n\ne AK’s recollection is not that atorneys urged SDNY to open an investigation into “the\nduo.” They were focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned in passing, not as a target.\n\ne AK did not participate in a second meeting with anyone. Had there been a meeting on\nthis subject in the summer of 2ol6 in SDNY, AK would have knoun about it in her\ncapacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\no AK had been in that role since approximately 2olo, and if someone came in to\nmeet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking mater, AK would get\ncontacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any\ncases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate. So\nif a second meeting had taken place with a supervisor in the office, AK would\nhave knoun about it. Dan Stein also would have brought AK in if he learned of a\nsecond meeting.\n\no AK would have made a record if there had ever been a second meeting. AK\nwould remember if there were a second meeting.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other irrelevant topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation.

Another important issue is to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v.

Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse.

The Court Should Reject the Government’s Atempts to Preview any Defense\n\nCase or Cross Examination\n\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant “is not\ncalled upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged.

Fratello, 44 F.R.D. 444, 452 (S.D.N.Y. l968). Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources.

Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (Black, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the substance of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein.

The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case.

Had there been a meeting on\nthis subject in the summer of 2ol6 in SDNY, AK would have knoun about it in her\ncapacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\no AK had been in that role since approximately 2olo, and if someone came in to\nmeet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking mater, AK would get\ncontacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any\ncases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate.

(Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics.

None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so.

There is nothing in Rule 4o4(b) that excuses the required\nNotice in the event the Government only offers the evidence \"in the alternative\" under the rule.\nBy disregarding the requirements of Rule 4o4(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence.\n\nII. Should the Government's Failure Be Excused, Ms. Maxwell Requests an\nOpportunity to Rebut any Proffered Non-Propensity Purpose and Basis\nBecause the Government has not identified the non-propensity purpose nor reasoning\n\nunderlying the admission of any Rule 4o4(b) evidence, the defense is left without \"sufficient\ntime for an independent investigation that might surface evidence that refutes, mitigates, or\nplaces the other act in a different light,” and the Court will not have sufficient \"time to consider\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6579", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9ofl2\nthe admissibility of the other act evidence.\" Wright & Miller, supra. Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule. Given\nthe significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally\ndifficult. Ifthe Court is inclined to grant the government additional time to satisfy the Rule, Ms.\nMaxwell requests ample time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the materials and to respond.\n\nIll. Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. The emails referenced in the Leter purport to be between Ms. Maxwell and\ntwo adult men, apparently arranging dates for them, with adult women, sometime in the early\n2ooos. They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the\nIndictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo658o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloofl2\nIndictment. It is hard to imagine hou an adult women fixing up single adult males with adult\nfemales is \"direct evidence\" of a conspiracy to transport, entice or traffic minors for sexual\nabuse.\n\nAs to the witness referenced in the Leter, the Leter makes clear that the witness worked\nfor Mr. Epstein from ggg, after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy in 2oo4. Given the\ntiming of her stated employment, it also begs the question hou her testimony, reference to\nunspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, \"among other things,\" could be\ndirect evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier.\n\nBut because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> these newly-disclosed\nmaterials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this time. The emails\ninvolve two persons not interviewed by the Government, so there is no interview memo to\ncorroborate their content. At least two of the potential witnesses are foreign nationals who live\nabroad. Ms. Maxwell will need time to contact and interview them. As to the newly disclosed\nwitness, the Government produced on October l2, 2o2l approximately 4oo pages of interview\nreports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to\nreview, <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October\nl8, 2o2l due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief\naddressing the proffered 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 4o4(b) since at least\nJanuary 25, 2o2l. See Dkt. l46 at lo.' The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule\n' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence\npertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 4o4(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an\nintent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone. See Dkt. 2o4 at l65-l69. Ms.\nMaxwell today moves separately to exclude the evidence pertaining to Accuser-3.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo658l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5oflil\nidentified a blonde woman as being at the residence.

None of the\npurported victims had ever met Ms. Maxwell. None of the purported victims claimed to have\nbeen recruited by Ms. Maxwell. None of the purported victims claimed to have any contact with\nMs. Maxwell, sexual or otherwise.\n\nThe investigation continued. On October 2o, 2oo5, a search warrant was executed at\nEpstein’s residence. Ms. Maxwell was not present and nothing belonging to Ms. Maxwell was\nidentified or seized during the execution of the warrant. Through trash searches and the search\nwarrant, the Palm Beach Police purportedly recovered items that it viewed as being relevant to\nthe investigation. The agency allegedly turned over all of the seized material to the United States\nAtorney pursuant to a subpoena.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6667", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 84\nin their ability to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> or move in limine. The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Background\n\nBoth the first and second superseding indictments described the defendant and Epstein’s\n\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-3.

Another important issue is to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

The Ninth Circuit en banc opinion also was critical of the\ntrial judge’s refusal to allou the defense to subpoena a critical witness of the bias. \"Where juror\nmisconduct or bias is credibly alleged, the trial judge cannot wait for defense counsel to spoon\nfeed him every bit of information which would make out a case of juror bias; rather, the judge\nhas an independent responsibility to satisfy himself that the allegation of bias is unfounded.\" /d.\nat 978.\n\nIf the Court is charged with the responsibility questioning Juror No. 5o, what resources\nwill the Court use to uncover any statements and misstatements made by Juror No. 5o? Will the\nCourt <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Juror No. 5o’s motives? Will the Court hire an investigator to find all of the\nposts made by Juror No. 5o about the trial? Having witnessed Juror No. 5o during the trial and\nhaving previously questioned Juror No. 5o -- both through a writen questionnaire and in person -\n- under the government’s farcical hearing the Court would be a (l) witness, (2) inquisitor, (3)\nfactfinder and (4) sole decision maker. These multiple, conflicted, roles are no model of due\nprocess.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error. This Court should vacate the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo922o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009288.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEum Bucher ens 684 Fileddz/24/22gePage B6 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

The evidence elicited should be the product of all available investigation and research.\nIn Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 976 (9th Cir. l998), cited favorably by the government,\nJudge Kozinski explained the perils of a court conducting a juror bias inquiry with incomplete\ninformation or failing to ask critical questions. \"[A] judge investigating juror bias must find\nfacts, not make assumptions . . . [I]t was the trial court’s obligation to develop the relevant facts\non the record, not merely presume them. The judge’s lack of verve in pursuing the mater casts\ndoubt on his findings.” /d. at 976-77. The Ninth Circuit en banc opinion also was critical of the\ntrial judge’s refusal to allou the defense to subpoena a critical witness of the bias. \"Where juror\nmisconduct or bias is credibly alleged, the trial judge cannot wait for defense counsel to spoon\nfeed him every bit of information which would make out a case of juror bias; rather, the judge\nhas an independent responsibility to satisfy himself that the allegation of bias is unfounded.\" /d.\nat 978.\n\nIf the Court is charged with the responsibility questioning Juror No. 5o, what resources\nwill the Court use to uncover any statements and misstatements made by Juror No. 5o?

Having witnessed Juror No. 5o during the trial and\nhaving previously questioned Juror No. 5o -- both through a writen questionnaire and in person -\n- under the government’s farcical hearing the Court would be a (l) witness, (2) inquisitor, (3)\nfactfinder and (4) sole decision maker. These multiple, conflicted, roles are no model of due\nprocess.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9894", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 32\ncommunications on Twiter and Instagram shortly after trial.

Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial.

The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had concluded that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories\nabout where Ms. Maxwell lived in l994—at a home in the Kensington neighborhood, or at the\nKinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood. The government chose not to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>\nwhere Ms. Maxwell actually lived in l994 and which, if any, of Kate’s stories were true. That is\nnot Ms. Maxwell’s fault.

The\ngovernment cannot seriously contend that an investigation into where Ms. Maxwell lived “did\nnot become necessary” until after Kate testified. Gov.

Gov.\nLeter at 6 (“That is a time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving\nmultiple agencies in each country that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the\nconclusion of trial.”).

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019951.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page92 of 2oo 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020309.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tra S3osaTentDGcWAerW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, 57Age Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nmaterials in the MDC. Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020790.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel72 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020801.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel83 of 2o8\nA-l79\n~ Case l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page 7 of l5\n\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is\nmaterial to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach\nof any one of these conditions allous the United States to elect to terminate the agreement\nand to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all\nfederal offenses.\n\nBy signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that\nthe Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal\nprosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021187.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya kee 3536o38, Pagel5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nxl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021190.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel8 of 258\nSA-l6\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 348\nll.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021216.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OED 3536o38, Page44 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 42 of 348\nother things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.!°\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. ‘7\nI. THE FBI AND THE USAO <span class=\"highlight\">INVESTIGATE</span> EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nIs Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\ni As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021242.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page/o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\n\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in combination with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\n\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\n\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position. I am also quite confident that no one\nag Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021251.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page/9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE, Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n88 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021313.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”'’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem.

Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021445.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 569 3536o39, Pagel5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses.

OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein.

Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023008.jpg": "<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023011.jpg": "treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023021.jpg": "carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior.

The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023025.jpg": "interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023028.jpg": "ll.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023054.jpg": "other things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Atorney’s Office’s\n\nHandling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\n\nIn 2oo6, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s atitude had changed and, according\n\nto Reiter’s statements in his 2oo9 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were\ncredible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmital leter, which was later made\npublic, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Atorney’s Office’s “treatment of\nthese cases [to be] highly unusual.”!© Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that\nyour office’s handling of this mater has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from\nprosecuting Epstein. !’\n\nIW. THE FBI AND THE USAO <span class=\"highlight\">INVESTIGATE</span> EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE\n\nTEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO\n\nA. May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nls Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\n\" As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023057.jpg": "Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023059.jpg": "On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.** On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n72 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nao After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023062.jpg": "disagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nAn Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.jpg": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.7** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.jpg": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\n\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\n\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\n\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\n\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\n\nwould any similarly situated case.\n\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\n\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>,\n\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\n\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n\nAo8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023281.jpg": "leters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [Vvictim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.jpg": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023316.jpg": "previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\nih In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4. l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects.

The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023325.jpg": "METHODOLOGY\n\nA.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDe EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permited to\nl3 BOP Program Statement 55lo.l4, Crime Scene Management and Evidence Control, is a restricted policy that is not\nreleased to the public in its entirety.\n4 BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023426.jpg": "a part of his job, and he would allou inmates to place telephone calls if they were unable to make calls\nunder ordinary circumstances.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that at approximately 6:45 p.m., he and Senior Officer Specialist l escorted\nEpstein from the atorney conference room to the SHU so that Epstein could place a telephone call. The\nUnit Manager said he put Epstein in the shouer area to make the telephone call because COs were present\nin that area. The Unit Manager explained that he also chose the shouer area because that location ensured\nEpstein would not be able to pull the phone cord into his cell and use it to harm himself. The Unit Manager\nsaid he plugged the telephone line into the legal line, which was not recorded, and dialed the telephone\nnumber that Epstein provided. As noted above, the number that was dialed was in the local 646 area code.\nThe Unit Manager said he alloued Epstein to place the telephone call on the unrecorded legal line because\nhe believed that Epstein had not set up his Inmate Telephone System account that would have alloued him\nto call on the institutions recorded lines. According to the Unit Manager, a male answered, and the Unit\nManager handed the receiver to Epstein. The Unit Manager heard Epstein say, “Hey, hou are you doing?\nHou's everything?” The Unit Manager admited that he should have verified who was on the line, as Epstein\nhad requested to make a telephone call to speak with his mother, and it was a male who answered the\nphone. The Unit Manager said he could not verify the phone number because he believed that Epstein did\nnot have his Inmate Telephone System account set up, and he did not have any phone numbers associated\nwith his account.

He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and\nasked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up.\nThe Unit Manager acknouledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done. The Unit\nManager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to\nbring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front. The\nUnit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member\npresent, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored.\nThe OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to\npublic records, died in 2oo4.

At the start of the hearing, Judge\nBerman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the\ngovernment and defense counsel a chance to speak.\nMost importantly, defense counsel stated they were \"all for finding out the truth!\" To that end, they asked\nJudge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent\nauthority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is\nimportant. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)\nconcerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense\ncounsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> a\nparticular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel\nobviously didn't knou that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go\nto SHU.)\nVarious atorneys for the victims spoke, too.

The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n? 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l).

Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA.

The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023054.tif": "other things, prohibit anyone from being present while grand jurors deliberate and vote, and\nproscribe the release of the notes, records, and transcripts of a grand jury.’\n\nD.

Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein\nto appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s\nobjectivity and the State Atorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his\ndeposition:\n\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the atention of the State\n\nAtorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s\n\nnot generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I\n\nknew that it didn’t really mater what the facts were in this case, it\n\nwas prety clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute\n\nthis case.\n\nOn May l, 2oo6, Reiter submited to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing\npackage relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein\nfirst victimized and then used to recruit other girls.

May 2oo6 — February 2oo7: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the\n\nUSAO Opens a Case File\n\nIn early 2oo6, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with\nAUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as\n“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD\nwas investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case\nagent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Atorney’s Office\nwas considering either not charging the case or allouing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\nl5 Fla. Stat. § 9o5.27 (2oo7).\n\nl6 See Larry Keller, “Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,” Palm Beach Post, Aug. l4, 2oo6.\nM7 As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;\nhouever, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that\nway.”\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023057.tif": "Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023059.tif": "On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.*® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n3o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023062.tif": "disagreed with her position.

Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerms is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater.

Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023151.tif": "Dershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\na7 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.tif": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.3°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to <span class=\"highlight\">Investigate</span>,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.tif": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023316.tif": "previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n“4l In Florida Bar v.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span>, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.tif": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023325.tif": "METHODOLOGY\n\nA.

The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act.

The Unit Manager told the OIG that after he handed the telephone to Epstein, his shift\nended so he left the SHU and left MCC New York for the day.\nThe Unit Manager said that when he left the SHU, Epstein was still on the call and the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Noel were at the officers’ desk, and that Senior Officer Specialist l was also present.\nAccording to the Unit Manager, when he was leaving, he told the officers, “Hey, make sure he gets his l5-\nminutes, and after that, he’s done.” The Unit Manager said he did not provide the SHU staff with\ninstructions to monitor the call. He said that after he left, he contacted Noel on the SHU telephone and\nasked her to make sure that Epstein’s call had ended because his time was up.\nThe Unit Manager acknouledged that he did not stay and monitor the call as he should have done. The Unit\nManager said the proper way to have an inmate place a telephone call on an unmonitored line would be to\nbring the inmate out and place him in a belly chain because then he would be handcuffed in the front. The\nUnit Manager said he should have provided Epstein with the phone, with a counselor or unit team member\npresent, and placed the call on speaker so the call was monitored.\nThe OIG investigation determined that Epstein did not, in fact, speak with his mother, who, according to\npublic records, died in 2oo4. The OIG found that Epstein actually spoke with Individual l, who declined to be\ninterviewed by the OIG.*? Individual l’s lawyer told the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of\nNew York during an atorney proffer that Individual l spoke with Epstein on August 9, 2ol9, at about 7 p.m.,\nfor approximately 2o minutes. Individual l's atorney proffer was that Individual l was in the country of\nBelarus at the time of the call.** Individual l’s atorney told the U.S. Atorney's Office that during the\n33 The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not Department of\nJustice employees.\n* The OIG did not <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> the factual accuracy of this proffer. We note that there are methods by which a call to the\n646 area code could connect to a telephone in Belarus.\n\n59\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23426", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023760.tif": "F. Administrative Remedy Program\nIt is imperative that inmates atempt to resolve any condition of\nconfinement issues internally either by speaking to appropriate\nstaff or through the Administrative Remedy Process. Further, all\nhousing units have bulletin boards that have information\nexplaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions,\netc.\nThe Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Program is a process through\nwhich inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to\nvirtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures\nhave not resolved the mater. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 -\nAdministrative Remedy; and Program Statement l33o.l3,\nAdministrative Remedy Program. This program applies as follous:\n{l} to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of\nPrisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract\nResidential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally knoun as Community\nCorrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and\n(3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their\nconfinement. See C.F.R. §542.lo.\nInmates are obligated to atempt informal resolution of\ngrievances prior to filing a formal request for administrative\nremedy. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l3. The deadline for completion of\ninformal resolution and submission of a formal writen\nAdministrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 2o\ncalendar days follouing the date on which the basis for the\nRequest occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.l4. Once an inmate has\nfiled a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the\nWarden of that facility has 2o calendar days to <span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> anda\nprovide the inmate a writen response. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l8.\nIf the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden’s response, he/she\nhas 2o calendar days to file a Regional Administrative Remedy\nAppeal (BP-lo). See 28 C.F.R. §542.l5. Once received in the\nRegional Office, the Regional Director has 3o calendar days toa\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and provide the inmate a writen response. See 28\nC.F.LR. $542.l8. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional\nDirector’s response, he/she has 3o calendar days to file a\nCentral Office Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-ll). See 28\nC.FLR. $l5. Once received in the Central Office, the\nAdministrator, National Inmate Appeals, has 4o days to\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigate</span> and provide the inmate a writen response. 28 C.F.R.\n§542.l8. After receiving the Administrator’s response, the\ninmate has exhausted the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program.\nThe program provides for expedited investigations and responses\nin emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both\nfiling grievances and receiving responses. At any level, an\nAdministrative Remedy may be rejected if it does not fully comply\nwith Program Statement l33o.l3, Administrative Remedy Program.\n\nPage l7? of 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2376o"};
