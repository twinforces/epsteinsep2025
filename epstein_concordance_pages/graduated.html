Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later.

She threatened my family and\nfriends.\n\nI have severe PTSD and two cancers as a result of my forced solitude, poverty, and quality\nof life while in hiding.\n\nThe shame I associated with my art follouing Ghislaine's abuse was overwhelming. I\nstopped painting. The thing is, this was never my shame to carry. I was a figurative artist doing\nwhat artists do, paint.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\n<span class=\"highlight\">graduated</span> from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021447.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel7 of 2l7\nSA-27l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\n\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\n\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\n\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\n\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man, To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. :\n\nPersonal History ,\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\n. from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was <span class=\"highlight\">graduated</span> from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033224.tif": "Personal Characteristics\nFriendships. Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son <span class=\"highlight\">graduated</span> from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033225.tif": "breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\nJokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Well, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\n<span class=\"highlight\">graduated</span>.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a difference [as] aur worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225\n"};
