In particular, the Government\nunderstands that the USMS expects that the defendant will arrive in this District early this week,\nwell within the ten days contemplated by the Speedy Trial Act for transfer of a defendant from\nanother district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F).\n\nThe Government has consulted with defense counsel, Christian Everdell, Esq., who has\nrequested that the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this mater take place on July\nlo, 2o2o. In advance of that proceeding, the parties jointly request that the defense be permited\nto file a writen bail application to the Court by 3:oo p.m. on July 9, 2o2o, and that the Government\nbe permited to file a writen reply by l2:oo p.m. on July lo, 2o2o. If that schedule is acceptable\nto the Court, the parties respectfully request that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial\nappearance, and bail hearing in this mater for the afternoon of July lo, 2o2o.\n\nAdditionally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the\nSpeedy Trial Act between the defendant’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o and the date of the arraignment,\ninitial appearance, and bail hearing before Your Honor. In addition to part of this time being\nnecessary to transport the defendant to this District, and thus subject to an automatic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of\nup to ten days from Speedy Trial Act calculation, see l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F), the Government\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo Filed o7/o7/2o Page 3 of 4\nemail within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial.\n\nFinally, the time between the Defendant’s arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the\nSpeedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.\nSee l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F).

The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l3\nsection protection does not apply to grand juries). Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v.

Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d.

Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nis compared to the eligible jury population of the Manhatan Division or to that of the entire\nSouthern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of\nBlack and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a\ngrand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhatan Division or the\nDistrict as a whole.

Relevant Community :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant community. According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id.

Under the external forces principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as\n“demographic changes”) do not constitute systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>. /d.; see, e.g., Schanbarger v. :\nMacy, 77 F.3d l424 (2d Cir. l996) (per curiam) Gury selection process “drawn from voter\nregistration lists” did not constitute systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>); United States v.

The lion’s share of Schulte’s\nsystematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> allegations is foreclosed by this principle.\nFirst, Schulte contends that the Government systematically excluded African American\nand Hispanic American jurors by seeking the Indictment in White Plains in lieu of the more\nracially diverse Manhatan community.

Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658.\nThis allegation therefore does not establish systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>. !\nSecond, Schulte argues that the Jury Plan’s replenishment of the master wheels only once |\nevery four years constitutes systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>. (Schulte Br. at l4.) According to Schulte, the\nfour-year period causes addresses to grou “stale” as people move to new residences, and because\nAfrican Americans and Hispanic Americans are, on average, younger and thus more likely to :\nmove, he argues that these groups are systematically excluded. (See id. l4-l5.) But even\ngranting the dubious premises that make up this deductive reasoning, the Court remains ,\nunpersuaded because, again, the true cause of the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>—younger people moving more |\noften—is an external force, not a systematic defect inherent in the Jury Plan. Rioux, 97 F.3d at )\n658 (concluding that a jury system that led to undeliverable questionnaires did not constitute ,\nsystematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>}. At botom, the Court cannot charge the District’s Jury Plan with a Sixth\nAmendment violation because of hou often people move residences throughout the District.\nThird, Schulte asserts that the Jury Plan’s exclusive reliance on voter registration lists\nconstitutes systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>. This claim, houever, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in Schanbarger. See 77 F.3d at l424 (“{A] jury venire drawn from voter registration\nlists violates neither the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement nor the Fifth\nAmendment’s guarantee of Equal protection.”).\nFinally, Schulte alleges that the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of “inactive voters” in certain counties within\nWhite Plains constitutes systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> because African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans are more likely to be inactive voters.

Equal Protection Challenge :\nSchulte next contends that the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors violates the Equal Protection clause under the Fifth Amendment.

Castaneda, 43o U.S. at 492. But to establish a prima facie violation\nof equal protection, Schulte must furnish “proof of discriminatory intent.” United States v.\nBiaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o). Because Schulte cannot make such a shouing, his 2\nEqual Protection challenge fails. His only contention on this element is that the\nunderrepresentation of African Americans and Hispanic Americans “cannot be the result of\n° Under New York law, voters are designated “inactive” when a “County Board received\ninformation indicating that a voter may no longer be living at her address of registration.”\n\n- Common Cause/New York v.

As to the former claim, Schulte has\nnot shoun that this alleged error caused the underrepresentation at issue. See Allen, 2o2l WL |\n43l458, at *ll (finding same error to have had “minimal” effect on venires). And as to the later |\nclaim, the parties concede that this glitch actually augmented, not diminished, African American\nand Hispanic American representation in the White Plains master wheel. (Gov't Opp. Br. at l7.)\n\nAccordingly, these allegations do not satisfy the third prong under Duren.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2838", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002839.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads £8 26 2o\n\nchance.” (Schulte Br. at l7.) But the Court will not assume or infer that this District has been\noperating under an intentionally discriminatory Jury Plan since 2oo9. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 659 :\n(rejecting Equal Protection challenge due to lack of evidence shouing intentional\ndiscrimination). Therefore, the Defendant’s Equal Protection claim must be rejected.\nTH. JSSA\nSchulte’s remaining claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on these claims, he must |\ndemonstrate a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions. LaChance, 788 F.2d\nat 87o, “Mere technical violations of the procedures prescribed by the Act do not constitute :\nsubstantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. (cleaned up). The criteria for\ndifferentiating between a substantial and technical error turns on the “nature and extent of its |\neffects[.]” Id. The Court holds that Schulte cannot demonstrate a substantial failure to comply |\nwith the JSSA and that his statutory claims must therefore be rejected.” :\nAs an initial mater, Schulte repleads his Sixth Amendment fair cross-section challenge\n\nunder the ISSA. (Schulte Br. at l9.) But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above. See supra ‘7-l7. |\nApart from his fair cross-section challenge, Schulte also contends that the follouing :\ndefects constitute substantial violations of the JSSA: (l) the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains and not Manhatan; (2) the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of inactive voters from :\ncertain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the allegedly erroneous proration of jurors ,\n'l To be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>\nprong of the Sixth Amendment analysis. See supra l5-l7. But because Schulte pleads these |\ndefects as separate violations of the JSSA, the Court conducts a separate analysis here. |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2839", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002840.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouRraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads 8 Bf 2o\nfrom the counties that overlap both courthouses; and (4) the clerical error by which voters who\nhad registered with an alternate mailing address were excluded from jury selection. (Schulte Br.\nat l9 -- 22; Schulte Reply at ll-l5.) For the follouing reasons, the Court concludes that these :\nallegations do not offend the JSSA.\n\nThe Government’s Decision. The Government’s appropriate decision to seek the |\nIndictment in White Plains was entirely proper and in accordance with the Constitution, JSSA, |\nand customary practice. See supra ll-l3. Accordingly, this prosecutorial decision cannot be |\nsaid to contravene the JSSA. |\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Exclusion</span> of Inactive Voters. In United States v. Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *lo, Judge ,\nRoman addressed the issue of whether the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of inactive voters from certain counties used :\nby White Plains violated the ISSA. See id. Judge Roman concluded that the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> did not, |\nreasoning that it is “entirely logical for a jury selection process to exclude individuals who have\nsince moved,” see id., and even if it did, that the defect was merely a “technical violation” of the :\nJSSA. Id. Because the Court agrees with this reasoning on all counts, it concludes that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of inactive voters here does not violate the JSSA.\n\nErroneous Proration & Alternate Mailing Address. Lastiy, Schulte argues that |\nprospective jurors from the overlapping counties of Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland were\nincorrectly prorated between the two courthouses, and that a technical glitch inadvertently\nexcluded jurors who had registered to vote with alternate mailing addresses. (Schulte Br, at 2l—\n22; Schulte Reply at l3-l4.) The Court is unpersuaded. As to the former contention, Schulte\ndoes not explain hou the alleged proration error constitutes a “substantial” violation of the JSSA, |\nespecially where its “effect” appears to be “minimal.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *ll (rejecting\nthe same argument on the basis that it was merely a “technical violation of the ISSA”).

Discussion\n\nThe Government’s decision to seek an indictment of the defendant from a grand jury siting\nin White Plains was entirely appropriate and consistent with the Constitution, the JSSA, and the\nSDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest on a faulty premise: That a\ndefendant who is likely to be tried in the Manhatan courthouse must be indicted by a grand jury\nsiting in that same courthouse. That is not the law. See Section XI.C.l, infra.\n\nThat foundational error is fatal to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the proper\ncomparators are considered—the White Plains Master (or Qualified) Wheels to the voting age\npopulation of the counties from which juries in White Plains are drawn, rather than the defendant’s\napples-to-oranges comparison of the White Plains Qualified Jury Wheel to the population of the\nManhatan “Division”’—the defendant fails to establish unfair underrepresentation under the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. Moreover, the defendant has not established that any disparity\nresulted from systemic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of a particular group. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nl. The Defendant Was Properly Indicted by a Grand Jury Siting in\nWhite Plains\n\nAt the heart of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim is her contention that the\n\nGovernment seeking an indictment from a grand jury siting in White Plains—which was the only\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 239\n\nThe result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\n<span class=\"highlight\">Exclusion</span>\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 4o; see also United States v. Barlou, 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir.\n\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 239\n2ol2) (affirming Judge Bianco’s “thorough and well-reasoned” opinion). Indeed, “‘[a] selection\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v. Superintendent\nRockview SCI, 939 F.3d 26o, 269 (2d Cir. 2ol9)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\n<span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of any identified group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

Assuming that they should have been considered, this <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess.

The result is that, considering all\nvoters in the county, only l out of every 4.5 are selected for the White Plains community.\n> The procedure may have been a compromise between having an overly burdensome process for\nvoters in the overlapping counties whose chances of jury selection would be twice that of voters\nin non-overlapping counties and the underrepresentation of voters in the overlapping counties in\nthe White Plains master jury wheel.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3627", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 3o\nsystematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity.

First, it claims that even though\nthe offenses in the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) are alleged to have occurred in\nManhatan (to the extent they occurred in the Southern District at all), and even though the case\nhas been assigned to and will be tried in this Court, the appropriate comparison population for\npurposes of the second Duren prong is the eligible juror population of the White Plains Counties,\nrather than that of either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District as a whole. Second,\nthe government argues that Ms. Maxwell has not satisfied the third Duren prong because any\nunderrepresentation was not the result of systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>, even though the\nunderrepresentation is atributable solely to the government’s decision to indict Ms. Maxwell\nusing a White Plains grand jury. Both arguments fail.\n\nl. The Relevant “Community” for Comparison Purposes Is the Manhatan Counties\nor, in the Alternative, the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe second prong of Duren asks whether a group’s representation in the source from\nwhich juries are selected is “fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the\ncommunity.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364. “Although the Duren court did not clearly define the term\n‘community,’ it is generally accepted that the term refers to the district or division where the trial\nis to be held.” United States v. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); see also\nUnited States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp. 869, 874 (E.D.N.Y. l995) (“the term refers to the district—\nor division, when a district has been so divided—where the trial is to be held”)\n\nWhile the government argues that those cases are inapposite because the grand jury and\npetit jury sat in the same courthouse, it cites no case that holds otherwise where the grand jury\nand petit jury sit in different courthouses—or any other case that holds that the relevant\n“community” for a grand jury is a community that excludes jurors from the county in which the\ntrial is to be held (and in which the offense allegedly occurred). Moreover, 28 U.S.C. § l86l,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3768", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page7oflil\nsiting in the same community where the case will be tried avoids a situation where one\ncommunity charges the defendant but a different community tries her—a situation that is\nparticularly fraught with fair cross-section concerns in an area such as New York City, where the\ndemographic composition of communities can vary dramatically. See also Declaration of Jeffrey\nMartin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l\n(filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”), at § 7 (“In my experience of over 5o federal\njury challenges [] since l997,” and “[u]ntil this case, I have not been involved in any jury\nchallenge where the Grand Jury came from one division and the trial jury came from a different\ndivision.”).\n\nAs noted above, courts have held consistently that the appropriate comparison\n“community” in a fair cross-section claim is the community where the case will be tried. Here,\nthat is either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District. Since the government does not\ndispute that when a comparison to either community is used, Black and Hispanic jurors are\nsignificantly underrepresented in the White Plains jury pool, the second Duren prong is met.”\n\nI. The Underrepresentation Resulted from Systematic <span class=\"highlight\">Exclusion</span>.\n\nContrary to the government’s contention, its decision to seek an indictment from a White\nPlains grand jury constitutes the “systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> . . . in the jury-selection process” required\nto satisfy the third Duren prong. See Duren, 439 US. at 364. “There is systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>\n* The government’s contention that the relevant jury pool to be measured against the comparison community is the\nWhite Plains master wheel rather than the White Plains qualified wheel, even if accepted, does not change the\noutcome. The government’s expert concedes that “the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury\nwheel will be significantly demographically different” from the juror populations of the Manhatan Counties and the\nSouthern District. Opp. Ex. l2 {4o (emphasis added). See also Martin Decl. {J l9-2l (shouing substantial\nunderrepresentations in eligible juror populations of White Plains vis-a-vis Manhatan Counties and Southern\nDistrict, including l3.94% underrepresentation of Hispanics when compared to Manhatan Counties and 9.29%\nunderrepresentation for Hispanics when compared to Southern District). In any event, the White Plains qualified\nwheel is the appropriate jury pool, as fair-cross-section motions concern the actual “venires from which juries are\nselected.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364; see also Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 538 (l975) ( [T]he jury wheels,\npools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in\nthe community.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page8ofll\nwhen the underrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external\nforces.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 658 (2d Cir. l996). Here, Ms. Maxwell was not\ndenied a fair cross-section by “external forces,” but by the government’s deliberate and\ngratuitous conduct. As the government’s expert admits, the White Plains jury pool is “not []\nrepresentative of the Manhatan or the Southern District community with respect to the percent\nAfrican American and Hispanic,” Opp. Ex. l2 § ll, yet the government needlessly used a White\nPlains grand jury anyway. That the government acknouledges having done so repeatedly during\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic only underscores the systematic nature of its conduct. Opp. l99 n.68;\nsee also Jackman, 46 F.3d at l24l (finding violation even in a discarded “process that had\ninadvertently, but systematically, excluded from petit jury venires all residents of Hartford and\nNew Britain, communities with large minority populations”).\n\nThe government’s reliance on United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l (E.D.N.Y.\n2olo), aff'd, 479 F.App’x 372 (2d Cir. 2ol2), is misplaced. In Barlou, the defendant argued that\nthe court’s facially neutral practices with respect to the disqualification of jurors charged with or\nconvicted of felonies led to the erroneous <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of jurors, and that the erroneous exclusions\ndisproportionately affected Black males. The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also concluded that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>, noting that “systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority population.” /d. at 42. This case, houever, is “like\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page9ofll\nJackman” (and unlike Barlou): The underrepresentation occurred because the government used\na White Plains grand jury knouing that doing so would significantly reduce the diversity of the\npool of jurors.\n\nThus, the government’s assertion that its decision to use a White Plains grand jury “has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected” (Opp. 2ll) is simply\nincorrect. By choosing to seek an indictment in White Plains, the government chose a grand jury\nselection process guaranteed to draw from a pool that would underrepresent Black and Hispanic\njurors via-a-vis the Manhatan Counties and the Southern District. That choice constitutes\n“systematic <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>,” and the third Duren prong is met.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth herein, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Indictment be\ndismissed.\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Christian R.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.

One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 78 of 8o\nmore, falls short of what our law demands. Though this appeal emanates from Cosby’s\ncriminal convictions, we cannot ignore the true breadth of the due process violation. The\ndeprivation includes the fact that D.A. Castors actions handicapped Cosby in the\nderivative civil suit. Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening Cosby’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore Cosby to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of deposition testimony can restore Cosby’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed Cosby. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that Cosby was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those prosecutions involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies. Critically, none of them featured the additional harm inflicted in\nthis case. In none of those cases did the effects of the constitutional violation extend to\nmaters beyond the criminal trial, as was the circumstance here. Accordingly, none of\nthose cases support, much less compel, the limited remedy that the CDO proffers.\n\nThe impact of the due process violation here is vast. The remedy must match that\nimpact.

In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

Opinion l: Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern of\nbehaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature\nof the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser.\n\nl. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2. Rocchio continues that “[i]ndividuals\nwith particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by perpetrators of sexual\nabuse” and that “[s]exual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or\ncoercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape.” Jd.\n\nThese opinions on grooming are not based “on scientific research or data.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2 (granting defendant’s motion to preclude evidence from the government’s\n“expert on sexual predator grooming techniques in its case-in-chief in a jury trial on charges of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5634", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 24\nSept. 22, 2olo) (finding expert’s opinion unreliable because the expert testified “that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem’). Rocchio’s testimony thus runs the significant “risk of being the ipse dixit of the expert\nagainst which the Supreme Court has warned.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3 (citing Gen.\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. l36, l46 (l999)). And because of her “inability to cite an error rate\nfor false positives,” her “testimony [is] virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-\nexamination.” /d. at *2 (citing United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42, l46-47 (D. Me.\n2olo) (excluding testimony about grooming in prosecution for transporting a minor across state\nlines with the intent of engaging in illegal sexual activity)).\n\nBut even if Rocchio’s personal opinion about the veracity of her patients were sufficient\nto render her testimony reliable, her patients are a self-selected group of individuals. Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior. Ex. l;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. o7-8383(LAP), 2olo WL 346637o, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.\n3l, 2olo) (<span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure that the\nmaterials he reviewed were representative”). Again, Rocchio’s opinions “cannot be challenged\nor tested in any meaningful way.” See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.\n\nThere are other problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony. She opines, for example,\nthat “[iJndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse,” Ex. l, p.2, but she doesn’t explain hou often. Half the time? Two-\nthirds of the time? Nor does she explain hou “frequently” the “sexual abuse of minors . . . occurs\nthrough the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\ndeveloped over time.” /d. Rocchio’s generic conclusions that grooming “often” happens or\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5636", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 24\n“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain hou these conclusions were\nreached, what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her conclusions can be\nverified.\n\nThis is exactly why the Court in United States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited). This Court should apply the teachings of Raymond\nto this case.\n\nFinally, Rocchio is a treatment provider of alleged victims of trauma, including victims\nof sexual assault. But she has no experience treating or evaluating alleged perpetrators of sexual\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5637", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 24\nB. Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (<span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 24\n\nFinally, Rocchio’s second opinion is inadmissible under Rules 7o4 and 4o3. It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol, 2l5\n(2d Cir. 2oo5) (“[T]he jury’s singular responsibility to decide from the evidence admited at trial\nwhether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”). That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse. Rocchio’s opinions on\nthose consequences are irrelevant under Rule 4ol and 4o2, they will not assist the trier of fact in\ndeciding the case, Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5642", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible.

The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions are unreliable.\n\nRocchio’s first and most prominent proposed area of testimony concerms “grooming,”\nwhich she characterizes as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to\nbuild trust and atachment with their abuser.” Ex. l, p 2.

Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior. Ex. l;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., Civ. No. o7-8383(LAP), 2olo WL 346637o, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y.

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying?

Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed disclosure. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (<span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 24\n\nFinally, Rocchio’s second opinion is inadmissible under Rules 7o4 and 4o3. It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol, 2l5\n(2d Cir. 2oo5) (“[T]he jury’s singular responsibility to decide from the evidence admited at trial\nwhether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”). That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse. Rocchio’s opinions on\nthose consequences are irrelevant under Rule 4ol and 4o2, they will not assist the trier of fact in\ndeciding the case, Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J.

In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\nirrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\nrelevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall. Dr.\nHall is an eminently qualified M.D. who conducted an independent medical examination of\nEis lo8-pacc,\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pageloof 25\n\nInstead of seeking relief under Rule 7o2, the government actually seeks relief under\nRules 4ol and 4o3, with an additional mention of Rule 7o3. None of the government’s\narguments is well taken, houever, if only because, “as with an expert’s qualifications and the\nreliability of his or her methodology, the liberality of Rule 7o2 insists that ‘doubts about whether\nan expert’s testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless\nthere are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.’” Washington v. Kellwood\nCo., lo5 F. Supp. 3d 293, 3o8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (quoting Jn re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., 489 F.\nSupp. 2d 23o, 288 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo7)).\n\nC. Excluding Dr. Hall’s expert opinions would deprive Ms. Maxwell of her\n\nconstitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense.\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page 23 of 25\nII. This Court Should Reject the Government’s Remaining Arguments.\n\nThe government objects to the adequacy of the notice Ms. Maxwell has provided with\nregard to Robert Kelso, John Lopez, Gerald LaPorte, and Jennifer Naso. Mot. at 2l-26. Really\nonly two responses are in order.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s notices are as thorough as the government’s notices were, so the\ngovernment can hardly complain about being in the dark.

If testimony from these\nwitnesses is not relevant, Ms. Maxwell will not call them. But if the government’s evidence\nmakes their testimony relevant, Ms. Maxwell can always provide additional notice if ordered to\ndo so by the Court.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis Court should deny the government’s motion.\nDated: November l9, 2o2l\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page4ofl7\n\nThe Court will partially admit and partially preclude these opinions. Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a subjective judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that effect would plainly violate Rule 7o4(b). The\nCourt therefore precludes these three aspects of Dr. Dietz’s opinion as well as any other\ntestimony that would similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming and\ninstead suggest that there is inadequate evidence of intent in this case.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that there is not empirical data on whether minors with particular\nvulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d. at 4. The\nGovernment responds that this opinion itself is unsupported in the academic literature. Gov’t Br.\nat ll. If experts disagree on the proper interpretation of evidence, “it is not the Court’s role to\nresolve the dispute through <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of one of the expert’s opinions.” Jn re Digital Music\nAntitrust Litig., 32l F.R.D. 64, 8o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). The Court concludes that Dr. Dietz’s\nextensive experience in the field provides an adequate basis for this opinion criticizing Dr.\nRocchio’s opinion. It therefore admits this opinion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page9ofl7\ndoes not match the particular facts of this case—are similarly appropriate grounds for cross-\nexamination but not for outright <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>. See Jn re Mirena IUD Prod. Liab. Litig., l69 F.\nSupp. 3d 396, 4l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6).\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz provides several opinions on “indices in determining the credibility of a\nvictim’s claims.” Notice at lo. The first of these indices is whether “the core details” of an\naccusation remain constant over time. Jd. The second is that an alleged victim’s “emotional\ndistress [is not] predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.” /d. at ll. And third, that victims\nof sexual assault “have higher rates of mental disorders,” which “can affect memory and recall.”\nId. As the Court explained in its opinion admiting Dr. Rocchio, “expert opinions that constitute\nevaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations are rooted in scientific or\ntechnical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2.” Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398. “And, a\nwitness’s demeanor on the stand . . . impacts the assessment of credibility” by the jury. United\nStates v. Lumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (emphasis added).\n\nWith this law in mind, the Defense explains that Dr. Dietz’s credibility testimony is\nrelevant primarily to argue that Dr. Rocchio improperly believed her clients’ claims of sexual\nabuse. Def. Br. at l3-l4. The Defense says that professionals in Dr. Rocchio’s field would\nevaluate their client’s claims in a clinical seting and that in a forensic seting Dr. Rocchio erred\nin believing alleged victim’s claims based on their outward emotions. /d.\n\nThe Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s opinions on witness credibility. First, they have only\nmarginal relevance. At the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio made clear that when serving clients in\nher clinical capacity, she does not “go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical\nroom.” Nov. lo Tr. at l6. As she explained, “in a clinical seting, it is not [her] role to\ndetermine whether something is or is not true.” /d. at 4o. Therefore, Dr. Dietz’s opinion about\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pageloofl7\nhou to verify victims’ claims is not responsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony from her clinical\nexperience. And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims. On the forensic side, Dr.\nRocchio takes on “an investigative role” and does not accept claims “at face value.” Nov. lo Tr.\nat l5. But Dr. Dietz’s opinion about evaluating victims’ credibility still has litle relevance to\nDr. Rocchio’s forensic evaluations. In explaining her method, Dr. Rocchio did not say that she\n“‘base[s] her opinions” on victims’ emotional distress. Def. Br. at l4. Rather, she testified that\nshe looks at a significant volume of documentation, conducts an 8 to lo-hour in-person\nevaluation, and “conduct[s] collateral interviews with others.” Nov. lo Tr. at 37-38. And\nconsistent with Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio said that she looks “for consistencies and\ninconsistencies in what the individual is telling [her] in order to form an opinion.” /d. at 39. In\nsum, Dr. Dietz’s opinion of determining witnesses’ credibility has litle relevance to rebut or\n“critique” Dr. Rocchio’s methods. Def. Br. at l3.\n\nSecond, there is a significant risk of prejudice. As explained, expert testimony that\nevaluates witnesses’ credibility is inadmissible. For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin\naffirmed the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of an expert opinion that a witness’s “confidence in identification is not a\ngood predictor of accuracy” because it “would effectively have inserted [the expert’s] oun view\nof the [testifying witness’s] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.” l92\nF.3d at 288-89. Dr. Dietz’s opinions that the consistency of core details is predictive of accurate\nclaims and that emotional distress is not predictive of accuracy are very similar to the\n“demeanor” opinion excluded in Lumpkin. Id. Even if the Defense intends Dr. Dietz’s\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l82", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l7 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of4\na defendant cross-examines a government witness to butress her theory of the case, rather than to\nimpeach the testimony given by the witness on direct examination, the cross-examination is\nproperly seen as part of the defendant’s case-in-chief.” United States v.

Accordingly, the rule “requires [the defense] to identify all non-impeachment exhibits\nthey intend to use in their defense at trial, whether the exhibits will be introduced through a\ngovernment witness or a witness called by [the defense].” Napout, 2ol7 WL 6375729, at *7. The\nreasoning is simple: a contrary rule would “permit defendants to evade pretrial disclosure simply\nby presenting much (or all) of their case-in-chief before the government rests,” thereby\n“frustrat[ing| the practical intentions behind Rule l6: to avoid unfair surprise and unwarranted\ndelay by providing both the government and the defense with a broad, reciprocal right to\ndiscovery.” United States v.

The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative\nvalue of each of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged Victim 4 is substantially outweighed by the risk\nof unfair prejudice.\n\nBut this balancing of Rules 4ol and 4o3 is based on the present record. It is conceivable\nthat an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative value of a diagnosis, such as\nthat mam 6—ti<i‘“‘—s~i‘;e‘~*@r would change the Court’s calculation. Cf George, 532\nF.3d at 937 (“We do not foreclose the possibility that testimony by an expert . . . could have\nshoun evidence of [the witness’s] condition to be relevant to her credibility .... But without\nsuch testimony, [defense] counsel had only words such as ‘episodes of rage’ and ‘racing\nthoughts.’”); Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2 (affirming <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of a psychological witness\nthat failed to shou a “clear link between any particular mental health diagnosis and a witness’s\ncredibility”).\n\nThe Defense argues that apart from diagnoses of her mental health conditions, the\nDefense should be permited to admit Dr. Hall’s conclusion as to Alleged Victim 4’s substance\nabuse i. Def. Br. at l2-l3 (collecting cases). The Second Circuit instructs:\n\nIt is, of course, within the proper scope of cross-examination to determine\n\nwhether a witness was under the influence of drugs or narcotics or alcohol at the\n\ntime of observation of events in dispute or at the time the witness is testifying. As\n\nWigmore points out, houever, a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of\n\nthe witness’s testimonial incapacity unless it involves actual intoxication at the\n\ntime of the event observed or at the time of testifying.\n\nUnited States v.

United States, l38 S. Ct. 22o6 (2ol8). <span class=\"highlight\">Exclusion</span> is “a harsh sanction not to be\nimposed lightly.” /d. at ll7; see United States v. Canada, 858 F. App’x 436, 439 (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(Mem.) (affirming a decision to permit an expert to testify who was noticed “the night before the\nlast day of trial” because the defendant “would have ample opportunity for cross-examination”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Government will offer testimony tomorrou for which the defense has received ample\nnotice, and there is no reason to preclude any testimony or permit any delayed cross-examination.\n\nFirst, the primary issue concerns Flatley’s discussion of metadata. The Government\nbelieves that Flatley’s anticipated testimony on this subject is properly considered fact testimony.\nFor instance, Flatley is expected to read an exhibit reflecting that the author of a document is\n“emax.” That is pure fact testimony. See, e.g., GX 4l8-B. He is also expected to testify that he\nused a program to confirm, for example, that the metadata reflected in GX 4l8-B is the metadata\nfor GX 4l8. That does not constitute expert opinion, either, because it is based on his investigatory\nfindings, not rooted exclusively in his expertise. See, e.g., United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n224 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“A witness’s specialized knouledge, or the fact that he was chosen to carry\nout an investigation because of this knouledge, does not render his testimony expert as long as it\nwas based on his investigation and reflected his investigatory findings and conclusions, and was\nnot rooted exclusively in his expertise.” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)). This\nexpected testimony is thus quite unlike the case cited by the defendant, Jn re Digital Music\nAntitrust Litigation, 32l F.R.D. 64 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). There, the witness testimony included claims\nlike the fact that “he chose to use a program named ‘ExifTool,’ which is a commonly accepted\ntool used for forensic data extraction,” based on “his experience with it and because it would allou\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of7\n\nWhere either party fails to comply with its discovery obligations, the Court has discretion\nto “prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed evidence.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(2)(C).\nWhere a defendant makes an untimely production of Rule l6 materials, including by “not\ndisclosing the document in the first place or by not fulfilling her continuing duty to disclose,” it is\n“properly within the district court’s discretion” to exclude the evidence. United States v. Bruce,\n75 F. App’x 849, 85l (2d Cir. 2oo3); see United States v. Weiss, 93o F.2d l85, l99 (2d Cir. l99l)\n(affirming <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of evidence that the defense disclosed to the government after “[t]he\ngovernment had already rested its case and the relevant government witnesses who could have\nprovided information about the documents were out of state,” because doing so “would have given\nthe defense an unfair advantage”); United States v. Napout, No. l5 Cr. 252 (PKC), 2ol7 WL\n6375729, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l2, 2ol7) (describing the “approach used by many courts”: “if the\nCourt determine[s] that a Defendant could have made timely disclosure, but failed to timely do so,\nthe defendant ran the risk that the exhibit would be excluded”).\n\nIl. Factual Background\n\nThe Government has made thirty-eight discovery productions to the defense under Rule\nl6(a), beginning on August 5, 2o2o, totaling over two million pages, triggering the defendant’s\nreciprocal discovery obligations under Rule l6(b). On June 2, 2o2l, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to produce its Jencks Act material and proposed exhibit list on October ll, and the\ndefendant to provide her Rule l6 disclosures on November 8—three weeks in advance of trial.\n(Dkt. No. 297). On November 8, 2o2l, the defendant provided the Government with a Rule l6\nproduction.\n\nOn December lo, 2o2l—more than a month later, shortly after the close of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But Eva, Michelle, and Kelly will all testify they were\nnot involved in and cannot “confirm” the group sexualized massages.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI.

Evidence is either relevant or it isn’t, and “unless an exception applies, all ‘relevant\nevidence is admissible.’” White, 692 F.3d at 246.\n\nUnder this “very lou” standard and “very broad” definition, the materials Ms. Maxwell\nseeks are relevant. Of the four motions to quash, only the government and Accuser-2 dispute the\nrelevance of the requested materials. Govt.

Accuser-2 relies on this Court’s earlier orders declining to issue a twelve-request subpoena\ndirected to BSF. That decision has no bearing on the motions to quash filed here.\n\nHere, the subpoena is directed to the custodian of the relevant documents (the EVCP) and\nnot to a different third party. The subpoena is also more narrouly tailored, including just four\nrequests rather than twelve. In addition, the subpoena is returnable at trial, not pretrial. And most\nsignificantly, nou unlike then, the Court isswed the requested subpoena after considering Ms.\nMaxwell’s brief in support.

R. Evid. 4o8(a)(l), or “conduct or a statement made during\ncompromise negotiations about the claim,” /d. 4o8(a)(2).\n\nThe Protocol makes clear that by submiting a claim, “a Claimant is seeking to resolve all\nclaims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related\nentities and individuals as set forth in the Release.”>” And it also makes that clear that “fall\nparties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a\nresolution of individual claims of sexual abuse.”*? The Protocol provides that “this Program is\nentitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent privileges),\n>!

United States, 87 F.3d 5o, 5l\n(2d Cir. l996). But in 2oo6, the rule was amended to make clear that it applies in that\ncircumstance. As the Seventh Circuit has noted: “In 2oo6 the Supreme Court promulgated an\namendment to Rule 4o8 demonstrating that at least the new version (which took effect on\nDecember l, 2oo6) applies to criminal cases.” United States v. Roti, 484 F.3d 934, 936 (7th Cir.\n2oo7); see 2oo6 advisory commitee note to Rule 4o8 (noting “statements made during\ncompromise negotiations of other disputed claims are not admissible in subsequent criminal\nlitigation, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of those claims”); see also\nFed. R. Evid. llol(b) (rules of evidence apply in criminal proceedings). And the Second Circuit\nhas since addressed the substance of a Rule 4o8 argument on a criminal appeal, without\nreference to Manko or to any possibility that Rule 4o8 was inapplicable in criminal cases.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial.

The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span>. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that advancing\nthe PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their sentencing\nsubmissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing submission\nschedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n328 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl28 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\nad Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23259", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030290.jpg": "Case 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document 3o5-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Page 9 of ll\nCase 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document296 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/ll/2oo9 Page 9 of 33\n. Page 9\n* + He *\nIn seeking to prevent the Defendant from being present in the room where the Plaintiffs\nare being deposed, Plaintiffs generally rely on treatise material from Wright & Miller, 8 Federal . ,\nPractice & Procedure Civ.2d, §2o4l, and cases cited therein. The case of Gaella vy. Onassis, 487\n| F.2d 986; at 997 (2d Cir, l973), cited by Plaintiffs, makes clear that the <span class=\"highlight\">exclusion</span> of a party from |\na deposition “should be ordered rarely indeed.” Unlike the Gaella case, there is no shouing by 2\neach of the Plaintiffs that there has been any conduct by Epstein, in rightfully defending the\nactions filed against him, reflecting “an iepressible intent to continue ... harassment” of any\nPlaintiff or a complete disregard of the judicial process, i.e. prior alleged conduct versus any\naction/conduct displayed in this or other cases that would justify extraordinary relief. There is :\nabsolutely no basis in the record to indicate that Epstein will act other than properly and with the |\nproper decorum at the depositions of the Plaintiffs and abide in all respects with the No-Contact |\nOrder. |\nWherefore, Epstein respectfully requests that this Court enter an order denying Plaintiffs’ |\n. Motion for Protective Order, provide that Epstein is permited to atend the depositions of the .\nPlaintiffs that have asserted claims against him in the related maters, and for such other and |\n7 further relief as this court deems just and propez. :\nMichael J.
