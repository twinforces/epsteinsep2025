Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001224.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocA one n Lee Gmeh/ol o4o 2F il @ 4223o) 26a geagfeol 5 G5 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . ..

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty.

They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9.

Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal.

In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001325.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88). She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5. Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the\nrisks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated\nclient, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no\nunderlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from\nCOVID-l9.° (/d. at 89-9o). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were\nsufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the\nGovernment to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between\ncounsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the\nDistrict Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (/d. at\n9o-9l).\n\n* For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make\npurchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC. Before her arrest,\nMaxwell ignored FBI agents’ directions to open the door and tried to flee to another\nroom in the house. A cell phone was found wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.

Judge Nathan found that the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> “makes it unlikely that the\nmisrepresentation was the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than\nmisdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). She explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything,\n\nstronger nou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court\n\nthat the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial Services\n\nwere woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises\n\nsignificant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been\n\nprovided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as\n\nto the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\n\nconditions of release.\n\n(Id. at l6).\n\n2l. Judge Nathan again concluded that Maxwell presented a risk of\nflight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her\nappearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained millions of dollars and other assets that\nshe could sell in order to support herself’ and the “proposed bond is only partially\nsecured.” (/d. at l6-l8).

(Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001619.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 9 of l9\nmake purchases for the property using the credit card. As these facts make plain, there should be\nno question that the defendant is skilled at living in hiding.\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore many of the obvious indicators of a flight risk by\narguing that she has lived in hiding because of unwanted press atention. This argument entirely\nmisses the point. First, the defendant’s conduct is clearly relevant to the Court’s assessment of her\nrisk of flight, because it evidences her readiness and ability to live in hiding, and to do so\nindefinitely. As such, even if her behavior in the last year could be atributed solely to her desire\nto avoid media atention, that should give the Court serious concerns about what steps she would\nbe willing to take to avoid federal prison. Second, the fact that the defendant took these measures\nto conceal herself after Epstein was indicted in this District — and after the Government announced\nthat its investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators was ongoing — cannot be ignored. To the\ncontrary, these measures are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nIn atempting to sidestep the evidence of her ability and willingness to hide, the defendant\npoints to her decision to remain in the United States for the past year while the Government’s\ninvestigation remained ongoing. She claims that because she did not flee the country during an\nongoing investigation, she will not do so while under indictment. This argument ignores the world\nof <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between believing that an investigation is ongoing and being indicted in six counts\nby a federal grand jury. The defendant nou faces the reality of serious charges, supported by\nsignificant evidence, and the real prospect of spending many years in prison. The return of the\nindictment fundamentally alters the defendant’s incentives and heightens the incentive to flee far\nbeyond the theoretical possibility of a charge during an investigation (one the defendant may have\nwrongly believed would or could not reach her). That is especially so when the defendant has\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... .

At this\njuncture, while the Government’s investigation is still ongoing, if trial remains set for July l2,\n2o2l as scheduled, then the Government does not intend to seek any further indictments in this\ncase. To the extent the Government uncovers additional evidence that it may seek to introduce at\ntrial, it will promptly disclose such evidence to the defense as either Rule l6 or Jencks Act material.\nAdditionally, the Government remains cognizant that its Brady obligations remain ongoing and\nwill promptly disclose any exculpatory evidence of which it becomes aware.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 239\n773 F.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]pplying [an] extended limitations period to claims that\nwere unexpired at the time of its enactment does not give rise to an impermissible retroactive effect\nunder Landgraf.”’).\n\nThe Second Circuit has considered in three cases whether retroactive statutes of limitation\nare permissible under Landgraf. In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent.

Although no method is perfect, see Berghuis v. Smith, 559 U.S. 3l4,\n329 (2olo), the Second Circuit has made clear that the comparative disparity theory is disfavored\nand strongly suggested that the absolute disparity theory is generally appropriate, see Rioux, 97\nF.3d at 655-56; see also United States v.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it.

Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3 of 3o\nDistrict of New York from the November l, 2ol6 jury eligible population is representative of the\ncommunity from which it is supposed to be drawn.

I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the qualified jury wheel and the community.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American percentage of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 percentage point <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the community would have been only o.57 percentage points, and the absolute\n<span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have\nbeen only o.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\ncommunity benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5 of 3o\nl2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the decision to not draw a proper random sample accounts for o.68% of\nthe absolute disparity between the actual master jury wheel and a random sample master jury\nwheel for African Americans and o.82% of the absolute disparity for Hispanics.\n\n8. Based on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it is evident that the percentage of\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics of the actual White Plains master jury wheel is similar to the\nestimate of the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics in the White Plains community.\nThe percent African American of the master jury wheel is l.25 percentage points louer than that\nof the community, (l2.45% versus ll.2o%) and the percent Hispanics of the master jury wheel is\nl.l5 percentage points louer than that of the community (l4.l2% versus l2.97%).\n\n9. Mr. Martin notes that the disparity between the master jury wheel and the qualified\njury wheel is impacted by a clerical error in transcribing the individual’s mailing address. This\nclerical error affected every county except Westchester. Houever, the impact of this clerical\nerror on the absolute <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for\nthe African American percentage is negligible, and the error actually reduced the absolute\n<span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for African Americans and\nHispanics.\n\nlo. In sum, as (l) the voter registration lists and the master jury wheel created from these\nlists reasonably mirror the representation of the community (an absolute disparity equal to or less\nthan l.25%), but (ll) because African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the\nquestionnaire used to determine if the potential juror was qualified, and/or (i) because African\nAmericans and Hispanics who responded were less likely to be found qualified, and/or\n(iv) because African Americans and Hispanics who were found qualified were more likely to be\nexcused, the absolute disparity between the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the White\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3625\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003627.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 3o\nrandom sample. First, the inactive voters in all counties except Dutchess were excluded from\nselection. Assuming that they should have been considered, this exclusion resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The\nsecond issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains community, three\ncounties feed both the Manhatan and White Plains master jury wheel, while three counties feed\nonly White Plains. The process for selecting for the White Plains master jury wheel from the\nthree non-overlapping counties was to select one out of every three voters, while the process for\nselecting from the three overlapping counties was to select one out of every 4.5 voters.* Thus,\nthe White Plains sampling methodology underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping\ncounties.°\n\nl4.

As discussed above, the first step in the process of creating the qualified jury wheel is\nto re-create the master jury wheel.

After selecting\npotential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 3o\nselected and those selected are sent a questionnaire to determine if they are qualified.

What in this process could cause the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in the percent African American and\npercent Hispanic between the benchmark and the qualified jury wheel? Belou is a list of all\nlikely possible causes of such a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>. In considering the differences, I view the process as\nmoving sequentially from the voter registration lists to the qualified jury wheel, and I compare\nthe absolute disparity in the percent African American and Hispanic at each step with that of the\ncommunity.\n\n24. Reasons l-3 focus on the causes of the differences between a master jury wheel that\nis drawn from the voter registration list such that every registered voter in White Plains as of\nNovember l, 2ol6 had an equal likelihood of being included, and the community. Reasons 4-5\nfocus on the causes of the differences between the actual master jury wheel and such a randomly\ndrawn master jury wheel. Reasons 6-8 focus on the causes of the differences between the\nqualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\nReasons:\n\nCommunity vs Randomly Selected Master Jury Wheel from Voter Registration Lists\n\nl) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because U.S.\n\ncitizens of voting age (i.e., the community) and those registered to vote (i.e., the master\n\njury wheel) are different.\n\n2) The estimate of the demographics of the community may differ from the demographics of\n\nthose on the voter registration lists because the estimates are from different times and also\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 3o\nand the more homogeneous the area, the more accurate the geocoding estimate. I defined the\npopulation in the census tract as U.S. citizens of voting age. To estimate the percent Hispanic, I\nused the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) method, which enhances the accuracy\nof the geocoding by also using information about the ethnicity of a person’s last name. This\nmethod has been shoun to significantly improve the estimation for Hispanics. !°\n\n27. There is one constraint on the accuracy of the geocoding methodology. The basic\nassumption is that if the potential voting eligible population (U.S. citizens of voting age) ina\ncensus tract is 85% African American, then we would expect 85% of those on the master jury\nwheel who reside in that census tract to be African American. Houever, since the master jury\nwheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this\nassumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract\nis the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to\nregister to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans\nand Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason l). Houever, there is no valid statistical\nevidence to conclude there is such a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>.\"!\n\n28. Based on the geocoding, the race and ethnicity representation of the master jury\nwheel is ll.2o% African American and l2.97% Hispanic.

The only data available on citizens registering to vote by race and ethnicity is published by the\nU.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey November 2ol6, and it shous the rates across\nthe state, not within the same census tract.

While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of community,\nthey are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the voter\nregistration lists and the community could be caused by reason l| and/or by reason 2 or by reason\n3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury\nwheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> may be caused by reason 4\nand/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel\nand voter lists may occur.\n\n3o. Focusing initially on the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance variation would only result in at most a o.ool <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\ncommunity (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 3o\nReasons 4 and 5\n3l. The actual selection of the master jury wheel was not a simple random sample from\nthe November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists.'7 Reasons 4 and 5 delineate why the selection\nfrom the voter registration list was not a simple random sample. The impacts of this can easily\nbe measured by simply estimating what the demographics of the master jury wheel would have\nbeen if the sample had been a simple random sample. The <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> thus measures the impact\nof not drawing a simple random sample. For reason 4, the prorating issue, we can exactly\nmeasure the impact by simply weighting upward the selections from the overlapping counties so\nthat they represent l/3 of the registered voters in those counties, as do the actual selections for\nthe non-overlapping counties, and then seeing what effect it has on the percent African American\nand Hispanic. To address reason 5, the sample frame issue, in order to determine the\ndemographics of a random master jury wheel if they had been considered, we need to knou two\nthings. One, we need to knou the number of inactive voters in each of these counties who were\nnot considered, and two, we need to knou what the percent African American and Hispanic is\namong those inactive voters. While I have the counts of inactive voters in each county,\nunfortunately, I was not supplied with, nor do I have access to names and addresses necessary to\ndetermine the extent to which the demographic characteristics of inactive and active registered\nvoters are different. This information is available only for Dutchess county. Therefore,\nprecisely determining the characteristics of a sample frame including the inactive voters can only\nbe done for Dutchess county, where such data exists.

The last step in creating the qualified jury wheel is the selection from the master jury\nwheel of those deemed qualified and not excused. Reasons 6, 7 and/or 8 are the potential causes\nof any disparity between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\n35. Focusing on the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury\nwheel, one possible cause (reason 8) is that the qualified jury wheel differs from the master jury\nwheel because of chance in selecting persons from the voter registration lists to be sent a\nquestionnaire to determine if they are qualified and not excused and should therefore be moved\nto the qualified jury wheel. While possible, it is not expected that the demographics of those\nmailed a questionnaire will meaningly differ from those not mailed a questionnaire. Any\nvariation should be random and equally likely to overrepresent or underrepresent any race or\nethnicity. Those mailed a questionnaire are chosen by a simple random sample drawn from the\nmaster jury wheel. Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.\n\n36. Houever, some <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury\nwheel may be caused by the clerical error in transferring alternative mailing addresses to the\nmaster jury wheel (reason 6), which was noted by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin. Ifthe clerical\nerror disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics either positively or\nnegatively it could explain some of the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the qualified jury wheel and the\nmaster jury wheel. That is, the clerical error failure to pick up the zip code from the alternative\naddresses on the voter registration list likely prevented the questionnaire from reaching those\nwho provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to\nrespond to the questionnaire, but we do not knou if the error affected more African Americans\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 3o\nor Hispanics or fewer. Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African\nAmericans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed\nquestionnaire because they did not receive the questionnaire due to this issue. I was able to\nidentify the persons on the master jury wheel whose questionnaire was mailed to the incomplete\nalternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the\nquestionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\nqualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\nqualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\nestimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\nqualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 percentage points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo percentage points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified\njury wheel and the community.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the qualified jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nrandomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the questionnaire, and/or\nthey are more likely to be found not qualified as a juror when they return the questionnaire,\nand/or they are more likely to be excused when found qualified, and, hence, African Americans\nand Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the qualified jury\nwheel (reason 7).

REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT\n\n39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury\nwheel and the estimated percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhatan, and\nthe overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then\ncompares the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White Plains\ncommunity, the Manhatan community, and the Southern District community.\n\n4o. He computes the absolute <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nand the White Plains community based on the 5-year 2ol8 ACS data, as I do. While I did not\ncompare the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the Manhatan and Southern District\ncommunity estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. Houever, since the\npercent African American and Hispanic in Manhatan and the Southern District are significantly\nlarger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by\ndesign the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury wheel will be significantly\ndemographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.\n\n4l. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random\nsample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,\ndue to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a\ndifferent selection rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on\nthe voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master\njury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who\nprovided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was\nthat voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the questionnaire,\npresumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo364l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 3o\n\n42. While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their\nimpact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If\nhe had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which\nhe raises concerns explain relatively litle of the absolute disparity in the representation of\nAfrican American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity.\n\n43. Mr. Martin’s declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in\nthe community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is\nof litle value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing\nthem to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not\nwhether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2o2o who were\ntoo young to register to vote on November 2ol6, or persons who moved into the area after\nNovember 2ol6 are not on the November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists. Houever, the issue is\nnot who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November l, 2ol6 voter\nregistration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the qualified jury\nwheel—that is based on the November l, 2ol6 voter population—and the benchmark for the\ncommunity—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also\nnot in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the\ncurrent community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the\ncommunity benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in the wheels based on the November\n2ol6 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the community demographics between\n2ol4 and 2ol8. The relevant question is what factors cause the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> he presents, and to\nwhat extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the community benchmark and the\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3642\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003691.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 34\nl7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v.

Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta.

Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004716.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 26\nIndictment before determining whether the plain-statement rule of Annabi applies. Annabi, the\ndefendant suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between newly\ncharged offenses and earlier plea agreements: if the offense is not covered by the plea agreement,\nthe agreement is irrelevant; if the offense is covered by the agreement but different! from a count\n“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Annabi rule applies; and if the offense is identical\nto a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent. (Def. Mot. at l3-l4). Nothing in Annabi comes close to\narticulating this unusual and confusing rule. Instead, the language the defendant points to in\nAnnabi simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish precedent. Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itself, those cases evaluate the text and history of plea\nagreements to determine the scope of the immunity provided by those agreements, including by\napplication of the affirmative appearance rule. See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x\n92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“In the absence of any language in the New Jersey plea\nagreement to suggest otherwise, and with no compelling reason to infer any intent to the contrary,\nwe decline to extend the New Jersey plea agreement beyond its clearly stated terms.” (citation\nomited)); United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Thus, we conclude\n' The defense motion uses the phrase “exact same” when asserting that this rule exists, but it is\nunclear what precisely that means because it is not a legal term of art, and there are of course\ncomplicated considerations when examining the similarity or differences between charges, as\nDouble Jeopardy Clause jurisprudence illustrates. The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 26\ncrimes listed in the NPA overlap with some (but not all)? of the offenses in the S2 Indictment.

This Court has firmly rejected that argument and has concluded that\n“In]o evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his\ncoconspirators in other districts.” (Apr. Op. at 6). The motion should be denied for precisely this\nreason.\n\nII. Counts Five and Six Are Not Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\nIt is axiomatic that “an accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double\njeopardy.” Serfass v. United States, 42o U.S. 377, 393 (l975). Here, the S2 Indictment is the first\ntime the defendant has been charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy, and the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause therefore does not prohibit prosecution of those offenses. The\ndefendant’s argument to the contrary fundamentally misunderstands that Clause’s protections.\n\n“TA]t its core,” the Double Jeopardy Clause “means that those acquited or convicted of a\nparticular ‘offence’ cannot be tried a second time for the same ‘offence.’”” Gamble v. United States,\nl39 S. Ct. l96o, l963 (2ol9). Accordingly, “[a] defendant may only raise a Double Jeopardy\nclaim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime before the alleged\n‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second\n> At most, the scope of the NPA’s coverage would appear to encompass Counts Five and Six. The\nremaining counts encompass conduct that both postdates and predates the temporal limitations in\nthe NPA, which was expressly limited to offenses between 2ool and 2oo7. (Apr. Op. at 6-7).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l8 of 26\n\nher interests or would have made a “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>” in her case. (/d. at l7). In her current\nmotion, the defendant offers no additional factual claims in support of her argument that the\npassage of time has prejudiced her defense. She instead refers the Court back to her prior\nhypothetical, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand scrutiny. The\ndefendant has not remotely carried her “heavy burden” of proof. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. Her\nrenewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment\ndelay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See United States v. Pierre-\nLouis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). In any event, in\ndenying the defendant’s pre-trial motions filed in January, the Court noted the absence of\n“evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Apr. Op. at l7). That remains true.\n\nThe defendant argues that the “S2 Indictment only compounds [the excessive pre-\nindictment delay] issues by charging additional offenses based on alleged conduct that the\ngovernment has knoun about since in or about 2oo7, which it added for tactical reasons to shore\nup its case against Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment acted in bad faith—to the extent she is making such an argument—is based on no\nevidence whatsoever, and for good reason: it is not true.\n\nAs the Government has previously explained (see Dkt. No. l99), the Government obtained\nthe S2 Indictment—which added counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor\nvictim, Minor Victim-4—based on new evidence that was not available to the Government at the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 Filed o6/o4/2l Page4of6\nmeritless. Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ production to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless.

That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes.

See 35o5-o74 at 3.\n\nCount Two of the proposed SDFL indictment is the same as Count Six of the S2\nIndictment and it is based on the exact same evidence that the government proposes to introduce\nto support Count Six; namely, the testimony of gg and related documentary evidence.\nSee GX-l-A through GX-l-P; GX-2-A through GX-2-W; GX-3-A through GX-3-KK; GX-4-A\nthrough GX-4-K (message pad slips); GX-55l (gg phone records); GX-8ol-8o3\n(FedEx records). The only <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> is that J changed her story and accused Ms.\nMaxwell thirteen years later when she was interviewed by the New York FBI. The fact that yg\nHE testimony led to two different charging decisions on two different occasions is\nrelevant to her credibility and the government’s acceptance of her differing testimony. The\ndecision by the USAO-SDFL not to charge Ms. Maxwell in 2oo8 is therefore relevant and\nadmissible. See Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2.\n\nThis evidence could be elicited without hearsay. Special Agent gg had first-\nhand knouledge that Ms. Maxwell was not charged in the proposed SDFL indictment because\nshe presented the indictment to the grand jury. See 35o5-ol8 at 28:5-8.

Morcover, the government’s decision to credit gy\nBE 2o2o testimony, despite its obvious inconsistencies with her 2oo7 testimony, goes to\nthe thoroughness and good faith of the New York investigation. The fact that Ms. Maxwell was\nnot charged in 2oo8 is highly probative of both issues and is not substantially outweighed by the\nrisk of juror confusion or speculation. It is therefore admissible.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo55o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 4o\na\nevery reason to believe that, if the Court orders that Minor Victims be permited to testify under\npseudonyms, many major publications will honor that request and not rebroadcast the Minor\nVictims’ names should they surface elsewhere.

Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections.

Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party.

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them.

Physical contact is then gradually increased.\nFurthermore, Gallagher (2ooo) found that in cases where “entrapment”\nbehaviors were reported, 43% of perpetrators initiated physical contact with\nthe child and l7% behaved in a sexual manner with the child.\n\nFurthermore, differences between genders of the victim have also been\nnoted in the sexual desensitization type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted\nthat the use of pornography to sexually desensitize children is more common\nwith male victims than with female victims.\n\nBoundary Violations\n\nBerliner and Conte (l99o) found that 7o% of children reported that their\nabusers “accidentally” came into their bedroom or bathroom while they were\nundressing; 6l% indicated that their abusers “accidentally” touched their pri-\nvate parts; 6l% said that their abusers did not respect their privacy or let\nthem close doors; 6l% reported that their abusers “accidentally” shoued\ntheir naked body to them; 57% indicated that their abusers would purposely\ndo things with the child that involved physical contact; 48% said that their\nabusers made sexual comments about the child’s body or clothing; 44%\nreported that their abusers asked them to do things that involved physical\ncontact; 3o% said that their abusers would inspect the child’s body “to see\nhou it was developing”; 3o% indicated that their abusers “taught sex educa-\ntion” by shouing pornographic pictures and touching the child’s body; 26%\nreported that their abusers told the child about sexual things he had previ-\nously done; and 22% indicated that their abusers put lotion or ointment on\nthe child when they were alone but said he was doing nothing wrong.\n\nAccording to Christiansen and Blake’s (l99o) stages of grooming in\nfather—daughter incest, the last step involves the father violating his daugh-\nter’s boundaries. In particular, fathers may insist on bathing their daughters\nand do not allou other family members to do this. These baths frequently\ninvolve inappropriate sexual behavior. Fathers also insist on dressing their\ndaughters or on watching them get dressed. In addition, fathers will tend\nto watch the child use the bathroom. Finally, perpetrating fathers will have\nsexually explicit conversations with the daughter to further desensitize them.\nGrooming the Child’s Environment\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 2o% of the offenders in their sam-\nple admited they gained the trust of the child’s family with the purpose of\nabusing the child.

Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Offering this opinion in this form can\nonly serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category,\nare more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz\nacknouledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a “‘case-by-case basis” (Ex. A at ll),\nthat case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and\nstereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that “significant proportions” of victims exhibit post-traumatic\nstress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are\n“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a\nsexual assault event.” (Ex. A at ll).\n\nThis opinion is confusing and appears not to be relevant to the facts of the case. First, Dr.\nDietz’s conclusion that victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms are unlikely to\n“unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event” is illogical given that it appears to place the\nresponsibility on the victim for experiencing repeated assaults, and at a minimum he should be\nrequired to disclose comprehensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as unlikely.\n\nSecond, a critical distinction in this case involves the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between victims of sexual\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers—\nincluding the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential between them and the abusers—\nand those who are not.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 29\n\nl2o J.

That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v.

See 35o5-o74 at 3.\n\nCount Two of the proposed SDFL indictment is the same as Count Six of the S2\nIndictment and it is based on the exact same evidence that the government proposes to introduce\nto support Count Six; namely, the testimony of gg and related documentary evidence.\nSee GX-l-A through GX-l-P; GX-2-A through GX-2-W; GX-3-A through GX-3-KK; GX-4-A\nthrough GX-4-K (message pad slips); GX-55l (gg phone records); GX-8ol-8o3\n(FedEx records).

The fact that yg\nHE testimony led to two different charging decisions on two different occasions is\nrelevant to her credibility and the government’s acceptance of her differing testimony. The\ndecision by the USAO-SDFL not to charge Ms. Maxwell in 2oo8 is therefore relevant and\nadmissible. See Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2.\n\nThis evidence could be elicited without hearsay. Special Agent gg had first-\nhand knouledge that Ms. Maxwell was not charged in the proposed SDFL indictment because\nshe presented the indictment to the grand jury. See 35o5-ol8 at 28:5-8.

Morcover, the government’s decision to credit gy\nBE 2o2o testimony, despite its obvious inconsistencies with her 2oo7 testimony, goes to\nthe thoroughness and good faith of the New York investigation. The fact that Ms. Maxwell was\nnot charged in 2oo8 is highly probative of both issues and is not substantially outweighed by the\nrisk of juror confusion or speculation. It is therefore admissible.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006533.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 4o\na\nevery reason to believe that, if the Court orders that Minor Victims be permited to testify under\npseudonyms, many major publications will honor that request and not rebroadcast the Minor\nVictims’ names should they surface elsewhere. The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections.

Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt.

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 43\n\n966 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\n\nprior to beginning any sexual abuse. Houever, this is a somewhat flawed\nanalysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter\nrelationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-\ning fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the\nrisk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, l987, as cited in\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o). Many fathers also shou clear signs of favoritism\ntouard their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and\nHolmstrom (l98o) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure\nto make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral\nstandards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods\nare the most frequent tool that offenders use.\n\nOne <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> has been found between genders of the victim in this\nemotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted that in male\nvictims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-\npetrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the\nmale child doun and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose\nthe abuse.\n\nSexual Desensitization\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-\nting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the\nchild about sex, 2l% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving\n(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would\nbe postabuse), and 2o% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,\nthese authors found that 4o% of all offenders said the first move they made\nwas sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders\nasked the child for help with undressing or lying doun. Forty-four percent of\nthe offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the\nchild, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders\nwould stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the\nchild to let them begin again. Many offenders commited the abusive acts in\ntheir oun homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to\ndesensitize the child.\n\nConte and colleagues (l989) found that sexual desensitization was com-\nmonly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender\nstated,\n\nMost of the time I would start by giving them a rub doun. When I got\n\nthem aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis\n\nto masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it\n\nwas OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical\n\nisolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.\n\n(p. 297)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l2 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 967\n\nKnoll (2olo) found that while a teacher is using bribery to gain the\ntrust of a victim, typically conversation about sexual maters with the stu-\ndent is also starting to emerge. Physical contact is then gradually increased.\nFurthermore, Gallagher (2ooo) found that in cases where “entrapment”\nbehaviors were reported, 43% of perpetrators initiated physical contact with\nthe child and l7% behaved in a sexual manner with the child.\n\nFurthermore, differences between genders of the victim have also been\nnoted in the sexual desensitization type of grooming. Spiegel (2oo3) noted\nthat the use of pornography to sexually desensitize children is more common\nwith male victims than with female victims.\n\nBoundary Violations\n\nBerliner and Conte (l99o) found that 7o% of children reported that their\nabusers “accidentally” came into their bedroom or bathroom while they were\nundressing; 6l% indicated that their abusers “accidentally” touched their pri-\nvate parts; 6l% said that their abusers did not respect their privacy or let\nthem close doors; 6l% reported that their abusers “accidentally” shoued\ntheir naked body to them; 57% indicated that their abusers would purposely\ndo things with the child that involved physical contact; 48% said that their\nabusers made sexual comments about the child’s body or clothing; 44%\nreported that their abusers asked them to do things that involved physical\ncontact; 3o% said that their abusers would inspect the child’s body “to see\nhou it was developing”; 3o% indicated that their abusers “taught sex educa-\ntion” by shouing pornographic pictures and touching the child’s body; 26%\nreported that their abusers told the child about sexual things he had previ-\nously done; and 22% indicated that their abusers put lotion or ointment on\nthe child when they were alone but said he was doing nothing wrong.\n\nAccording to Christiansen and Blake’s (l99o) stages of grooming in\nfather—daughter incest, the last step involves the father violating his daugh-\nter’s boundaries. In particular, fathers may insist on bathing their daughters\nand do not allou other family members to do this. These baths frequently\ninvolve inappropriate sexual behavior. Fathers also insist on dressing their\ndaughters or on watching them get dressed. In addition, fathers will tend\nto watch the child use the bathroom. Finally, perpetrating fathers will have\nsexually explicit conversations with the daughter to further desensitize them.\nGrooming the Child’s Environment\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 2o% of the offenders in their sam-\nple admited they gained the trust of the child’s family with the purpose of\nabusing the child.

Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

I think this is a study that has really done a good job of\nl9 integrating what we knou and pulling together the literature,\n2o and then puting it to an empirical test. There have been\n2l other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred\n22 to as grooming.

So different\nl8 studies use different measures. There are other studies that\nl9 looked at inter-rater reliability. In other words, if someone\n2o is coding the content of a qualitative interview that's been\n2l done, they'll look at the degree of agreement and of course\n22 potential disagreement, which would be error, in differences of\n23 opinion, and atempt to address and resolve those.\n24 But, as I had indicated earlier, in this field, a pure\n25 error rate, as in many areas of the social sciences, cannot be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel9 of 28\n\nFinally, the government points to Dr. Dietz’s “acknouledgement” that credibility should\nbe judged on a “case-by-case basis.” Mot at 23. That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is irrelevant and\nshould be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 29 of 375\nl986\n\nSchooler, J.W., Gerhard, D., & Loftus, E.F.

Indeed, the only question the jury raised in\nthe Note was whether it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element if they found that Ms.\nMaxwell helped arrange Jane’s return flight from New Mexico as opposed to her flight to New\nMexico. /d. Any sexual abuse that occurred in New Mexico was not a violation of New York\nlaw and was therefore an entirely distinct offense from the one charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe corroborating evidence supports the interpretation that the jury did not credit Jane’s\ntestimony that Ms. Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s sexual abuse in New York\nand was instead focused on her involvement in the New Mexico conduct. The most important\npiece of evidence corroborating Jane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot,\nDave Rodgers. See GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence offered\nat trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York and New Mexico and when\nthose trips may have taken place. According to the flight logs, there were only two trips that\nJane may have taken while she was under the age of l7, which was significant because to convict\nunder Count Four, the jury had to find that Jane was under l7 years old when the abuse took\nplace. The first was a trip from Palm Beach to New York (Teterboro) on November ll, l996,\nwhen Jane was l6 years old. GX-662-R at 44. The second was a trip from New York\n(Teterboro) to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997, also when Jane was l6 years old. GX-\n662-R at 48. The critical <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the two trips was that Ms. Maxwell was not a\npassenger on the first trip to New York but was a passenger on the second trip to New Mexico.\n\nGiven the text of the Jury Note, it is likely that the jurors decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s\ntrips to New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her\ntrip to New Mexico.

As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry\nfrom the extreme circumstances in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that\nthe juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological\nliar who does not knou the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.\n\nThe record also does not support the defendant’s atempt to compare Juror 5o to Juror 55,\n7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 5o LF\na.

Mot. at l4 (citing GX-662-R at 44)), but\nwould have accepted her much briefer and less detailed testimony about abuse in New Mexico\nsolely because it was corroborated by a flight record.°\n\nThe defendant also speculates that the jury then decided to acquit the defendant on Count\nTwo but not on Count Four because the jury convicted based on the evidence related to the New\nMexico trip. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury acquited the defendant of enticement\nbecause the flight logs shoued that “she was present on the trip [to New Mexico] but said nothing\nabout whether she ‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did\nnot testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell prior to the flight to New Mexico in\nwhich they discussed the trip.” (Def. Mot. at l5). In contrast, the defendant suggests that the jury\nmust have “found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from New\nMexico,” which they took to be sufficient. But there is no specific evidence—not a flight record,\nand not in Jane’s testimony—of hou and to where Jane returned from that particular New Mexico\ntrip, much less that the defendant participated in or made Jane’s travel arrangements. (See Tr.\n3l29-3o (defense referring to the return flight as “going somewhere away from... New Mexico”\nand as “some other flight besides the flight to New Mexico”)). In the defendant’s view, the jury\nrejected nearly all of the evidence relating to Jane for lack of corroboration, and then convicted the\n3 The defendant says that the “critical <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>” between those trips is that the defendant was not\nlisted as a passenger on the trip to New York but is listed on the second trip to New Mexico. (Def.\nMot. at l4). That <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, houever, says nothing about whether the jury required a\ncorroborative flight record before crediting Jane’s account of travel to and abuse in New York or\nNew Mexico.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo958l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 3oof5l\n\nThe defendant asks the Court to ignore these legal distinctions. In particular, the defendant\nurges the Court not to apply the first Korfant factor, claiming—without explanation—that this first\nfactor applies to claims arising from successive prosecutions, and not multiplicity claims. (Def.\nMot. at 22 n.4). But the Korfant factors are applied both when courts compare indictments in\nsuccessive prosecutions and when courts analyze counts in the same indictment.’ See, e.g.,\nGuzman, 7 F. App’x at 54-55 (applying the Korfant factors to a claim of multiplicity arising from\nmultiple conspiracy counts in the same indictment); United States v. Diallo, 5o7 F. App’x 89, 9l\n(2d Cir. 2ol3) (holding that two narcotics conspiracy counts charged in the same case were not\nmultiplicitous under the Korfant factors); Estrada, 32o F.3d at l8o-8l (applying the Korfant\nfactors to a successive prosecution); Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d at 3o7 (applying the Korfant factors\nto a successive prosecution). For good reason: it would make litle sense to ignore the legal\ndistinctions between counts when determining whether those counts are different in law and fact\nfor double jeopardy purposes. See United States v. Hicks, 5 F.4th 27o, 275 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (citing\nBlockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (l932)). The defendant asks this Court to ignore the\nfirst Korfant factor because it is fatal to her multiplicity claim. The two counts are legally distinct,\nand the Court can and should reject the defendant’s multiplicity claim for this reason alone.\n7 The lone case cited by the defendant, United States v. Cooper, 886 F.3d l46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol8),\nheld that two § 37l counts in the same indictment were multiplicitous. (Def. Mot. at 22 n.4). In\nreaching that conclusion, the Court did not hold that the first Korfant factor was inapplicable to\nthat particular procedural posture. The defendant otherwise cites no case in which a court held\nthat it was inappropriate to examine the legal differences between counts when evaluating a\nmultiplicity claim.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9592\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 34of5l\n\nIt makes no <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, as the defendant argues, that both crimes involved grooming minors\nfor sexual abuse. (Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming\ntechniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 7l3). But using a\ncommon tool among sexual offenders does not render the distinct conspiracies here multiplicitous;\nif that were true, presumably many federal crimes against children would be multiplicitous.\n\nThe Government was clear at trial that, while the defendant and Epstein commited crimes\ntogether for years, they did so through different schemes, in violation of different laws. That is\nwhat the S2 Indictment charged, and that is what the Government proved at trial: different\nconspiracy crimes. The Court should deny the motion and enter judgment on Counts Three and\nFive.\n\nIll. The Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Her Conviction and Dismiss the Indictment\nBased on Alleged Improper Pre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should vacate her conviction and dismiss the\nIndictment because the Government’s allegedly excessive delay in bringing the charges violates\nher due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 25). The defendant’s contention should be swiftly rejected.\nThe Court has twice evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and twice\nconcluded that the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a\nclaim that any alleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7;\nDkt. No. 3l7 at lo). Her arguments fare no beter post-trial.\n\nThe defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. First, the defendant has not established that any alleged pre-\nindictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense. Her speculative assertions about lost\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 49\nserve as jurors in such cases, the defendant would have cited case law that actually supports that\nproposition.\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that bias should be implied because she alleges that Juror\n5o has repeatedly lied. (Def. Mem. at 35-36 (citing Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472)). As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry\nfrom the extreme circumstances in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that\nthe juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological\nliar who does not knou the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.\n\nThe record also does not support the defendant’s atempt to compare Juror 5o to Juror 55,\nwho was dismissed for cause foe\nee\n7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 5o lied about his social media\naccounts. Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in\nwhich the Court must consider the hypothetical question whether, if the juror had truthfully\nanswered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d\na post-verdict posture, if the Court were to find that Juror 5o intentionally lied about using social\nmedia accounts, the question would be whether the Court would have struck him if he had\ntruthfully answered that question. There is nothing in the record about Juror 5o’s use of social\nmedia accounts that would have supported a challenge for cause at voir dire.\n\nIn sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009928.jpg": "meesbabammedaeieaellieameeny) ir 77 (a FRO RSA Pn Reker 26 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,\nwhereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\nconsideration of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l5 of 4o\ncritical role in those extreme cases where dissatisfied litigants may be tempted to harass or\ntamper with jurors in an atempt to impeach the verdict. See Tanner, 483 U.S. at l2o-2l.\n\nFinally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have\nexercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual\nabuse. Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a\nnew trial because Juror 5o’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise\nher peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court. Indeed, in making this argument\nshe cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. But the rule\nin New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See State v. Scher, 65o\nA.2d lol2, lol9-2o (N.J. App. Div. l994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its\nfederal counterpart” of McDonough). Under McDonough, a defendant seeking a new trial must\nshou that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 464\nU.S. at 555-56 (emphasis added). A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the\nperemptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (concluding\nthat a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may\ncertainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for\narguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause”). That <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\narises in part from the fact that “[u]nlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not\nconstitutionally required.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 n.4.\n\nTW. ANALYSIS\nA. McDonough Prong One\n\nThe Court begins with what Juror 5o’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:\n\nJuror 5o provided inaccurate answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire. For each\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page8of45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property’’).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. E.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page9of 45\n\n*ll (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire\nfraud were the same conspiracy as earlier conspiracy to use or transfer false IDs). After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a conspiracy to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a conspiracy to transport minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. F.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an essential role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls .. . to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”’), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”’), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel4of 45\nsexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the\nexistence of a conspiracy and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New\nYork. In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.” Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to\nconsider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record. See id. at\nl96; United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 282 (2d Cir. 2oo6). In Maslin, the Second Circuit\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo38o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.

Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v.

(quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6 of 29\nenhancements that were applied in the PSR, the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo3\nGuidelines would be roughly 75% Jess than the recommended sentencing range under the 2oo4\nGuidelines: l68-2lo months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 35 under the 2oo3\nGuidelines versus 292-365 months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of 4o under\nthe 2oo4 Guidelines.” The parties dispute, houever, whether the offense conduct ended before\nor after November l, 2oo4, and whether a court or a jury must make that finding. See USSG §\nlBl.ll, cmt. n.2 (the “last date of the offense of conviction” is the “controlling date for ex post\nfacto purposes”).\n\nProbation and the government assert that the 2oo4 Guidelines apply because the second\nsuperseding indictment (the “S2 Indictment’’) generally alleges that the criminal conduct ended\n“in or about 2oo4” and the Court should find based on the trial testimony and other evidence that\nthe offense conduct continued “through the end of 2oo4.” See PSR at 58. That is legally and\nfactually incorrect. For the reasons set forth more fully belou, the Court must apply the 2oo3\nGuidelines in this case because (l) the jury, not the Court, must determine the end date of the\ncriminal conduct when that fact dictates which Guidelines book applies consistent with the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; (2) even if the Court may make that determination, the trial record is\ninsufficient to find that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date\nof the 2oo4 Guidelines; and (3) it would not serve the goals of sentencing to apply the harsher\n2oo4 Guidelines in this case when the record is clear that Ms. Maxwell was no longer actively\nparticipating in the offense conduct by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at the latest.\n\n? The five-point <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in the total offense level is driven by the base offense level. Under the 2oo3 Guidelines,\nthe applicable base offense level is l9. See USSG § 2Gl.l(a)(l) (2oo3). Under the 2oo4 Guidelines, the applicable\nbase offense level is 24. See USSG § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4).

United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 3o of 77\nconfinement, conditions far more arduous than those experienced by pretrial detainees, or even\nsentenced prisoners, in general population.

Ms. Maxwell bore the\nbrunt of unusual conditions imposed by unfetered prison bureaucrats. The Supreme Court defines\n“unusual” as “something different from that which is generally done.”!® Under an original\nunderstanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause (U.S. Const. amend. vi), “a\npunishment is cruel and unusual if it is overly harsh in light of longstanding practice.”!? Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement were significantly and unjustifiably harsher than conditions\nin general population making it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. Follouing Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest, then-Atorney General William Barr was intent on making sure what happened\nto Epstein while in BOP custody would not be repeated and issued directives to be applied\nexclusively to Ms. Maxwell.

Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging\nconditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 2l8 (2d Cir. 2ol5), which\ninvolved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s detention was far more arduous and constituted\na more serious penalty than conventional detention is general population. While the hardship of\nimprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the\nhardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature. This distinction demands a different calibration\nwhereby each day spent in isolation - especially where isolation is not based on any behavior\nmanifested by the inmate and while the inmate is presumed innocent - should result in an enhanced\ntime-served credit.\nIncarceration During the Pandemic Supports a Well-Recognized Sentence Reduction\n\nCourts in this district and elsewhere have acknouledged COVID hardship as a basis for\ndounward variances from the guidelines.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial.

None of this would have happened but for\nGhislaine’s determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and\nsheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.\nThose personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and\nsponsors), were acknouledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their l7\nSustainable Development Goals for 2ol5-3o.\n\n| believe Ghislaine still has much to contribute to the world if she is given a meaningful\nopportunity to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\nlan Maxwell\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 3lof55\nbe presumed because of the substantial <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in age between the participant and the minor.”\nId.\n\nOn the facts, the defendant does not resist application of this enhancement to any victim\nother than Carolyn. As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, traumatic personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a relationship of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming application of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”).

Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l.

In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring.

And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable.

And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015225.jpg": "l986\n\nSchooler, J.W., Gerhard, D., & Loftus, E.F.

And\n4 typically, he would take a Concorde from New York to Paris, but\na otherwise anytime else, it was mostly private.\n6 Q. Hou about Ms. Maxwell, during that same period, to your\n7 knouledge, did she only fly on Mr. Epstein's private planes?\n\n8 A. She flew on the private planes.

What did Ms. Maxwell tell you about that?\nl4 A. That it was her jet, which, in fact, it was, because she\nl5 was partial ouner of the jet and she had access to it with\nl6 notice.\nl7 Q. Could you explain the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between flying on a\nl8 private plane and flying commercially.\nl9 A. Well, the best advantage is you leave when you want.\n2o Otherwise, flying privately, security is much less. You don't\n2l have TSA, you don't have x-rays, you come and go as you please,\n22 prety much. Some airports even let you drive your car\n23 directly onto the ramp next to the aircraft and unload.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . ..

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial.

They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well.

Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020242.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88). She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5. Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the\nrisks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated\nclient, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no\nunderlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from\nCOVID-l9.° (/d. at 89-9o). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were\nsufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the\nGovernment to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between\ncounsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the\nDistrict Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (/d. at\n9o-9l).\n\n* For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make\npurchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC. Before her arrest,\nMaxwell ignored FBI agents’ directions to open the door and tried to flee to another\nroom in the house. A cell phone was found wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.

(/d. at l5).\nJudge Nathan highlighted that in July 2o2o Maxwell represented to Pretrial Services\nthat she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection with her renewed\nrequest for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth of\nMaxwell and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o.

Judge Nathan found that the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> “makes it unlikely that the\nmisrepresentation was the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than\nmisdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). She explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything,\n\nstronger nou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court\n\nthat the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial Services\n\nwere woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises\n\nsignificant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been\n\nprovided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as\n\nto the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\n\nconditions of release.\n\n(Ud. at l6).\n\n2l. Judge Nathan again concluded that Maxwell presented a risk of\nflight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her\nappearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained millions of dollars and other assets that\nshe could sell in order to support herself’ and the “proposed bond is only partially\nsecured.” (/d. at l6-l8).

(Ex. H\nat ll-l4; Ex. L at 8-ll). Maxwell atempts to compare herself to other high-profile\ndefendants (Br. 25), but Judge Nathan rejected the comparison, noting “crucial\nfactual differences” in several of these cases (Ex. D at 88) and making extensive\nfindings about the particular facts and circumstances of this case that make detention\nappropriate. None of this was clear error.\n\n2. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err or Abuse Its Discretion by\n\nDenying Temporary Release\n\n37. Maxwell also argues that she should be temporarily released—\nthough she specifies no end date—because she cannot effectively prepare her\ndefense under the conditions of her confinement. (Br. l3-l9). Judge Nathan did not\nabuse her discretion or clearly err by concluding otherwise.° To the contrary, Judge\nNathan has gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has adequate access\nto her counsel and opportunity to prepare her defense.\n° As noted, this Court has not resolved which standard of review applies to such an\napplication. The Government submits that the decision of whether temporary release\nis “necessary” is a mixed question of law and fact which, like the district court’s bail\ndetermination, should be reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Matis, 963\nF.3d 285, 29l (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court need not resolve the mater here, houever,\nas Maxwell’s claim fails under either standard of review.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020776.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel58 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7 of 34\nl7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v.

See id. This is a stringent standard. “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have\nshut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses\nprosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.” DeMichele v.\nGreenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist.

Houever, it is enough to say that\nMaxwell does not make the strong shouing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.\nMaxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests\nbecause potential witnesses have died, others have forgoten, and records have been lost or\ndestroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\nin her case.\n\nMaxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include\nJeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged\nvictims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends\nthey all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have\ngenerally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable\ntestimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388\nF. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach.

A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the\nperemptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (concluding\nthat a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may\ncertainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for\narguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause’). That <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>\narises in part from the fact that “[uJnlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not\nconstitutionally required.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 n.4.\nIll. ANALYSIS\n\nA. McDonough Prong One\n\nThe Court begins with what Juror 5o’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:\n\nJuror 5o provided inaccurate answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire. For each\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o976\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020991.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel65 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 8 of 45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. F.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020992.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel66 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 9 of 45\n\n*ll (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire\nfraud were the same conspiracy as earlier conspiracy to use or transfer false IDs). After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a conspiracy to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a conspiracy to transport minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. E.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an essential role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020995.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel69 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls . .. to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020997.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l4 of 45\nsexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the\nexistence of a conspiracy and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New\nYork. In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.” Eppelito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf’ Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to\nconsider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record. See id. at\nl96; United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 282 (2d Cir. 2oo6).

(quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance ls not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22).

Restrepo, 89o F.Supp. l8o, l9l\n(E.D.N.Y. l995) (Weinstein, J.); see also U.S. v. Ozuna, l29 F.Supp.2d l345, l354\n(S.D. Fla. 2ool); U.S. v.

This rule prevents the Government\nfrom parachuting into a new circuit and prosecuting a case it would not otherwise\nhave been able to bring. That rationale applies with equal force here.

Houever, based on the preceding arguments, the Court may determine\nthat only Counts Three and Four or Three and Six should be reversed.

When the evidence admissible to\nprove the remaining counts arises from a distinct set of facts in a different time-\nperiod, involving a different complainant and the evidence admissible to prove the\ndismissed counts would not have been admissible to prove the remaining count,\ncourts will find prejudice warranting a new trial on the remaining counts. /d.\n\nHere, Counts Four and Six arise from distinct facts, time-periods, and\ncomplainants.

He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021579.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document oO N_Ao3 3536o39, Pagel49 of 2l7\n34\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl With respect to the testimony of the pilots who\n\n2 testified, whether they -- whether an employee was paid by\n\n3 Maxwell or Epstein or technically reported to one, according to\n4 their job descriptions, is not the question here.

Actual\nand inferred bias are both commited to the province\nof the trial judge, and Judge Nathan’s findings that\nneither existed were not clearly erroneous. See Torres,\nl28 F.3d at 44 (“[A] finding of actual bias is based upon\ndeterminations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”); United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[A]\nfinding of inferred bias is, by definition, within the dis-\ncretion of the trial court.”).\n\nMaxwell also argues that Judge Nathan should\nhave implied bias, highlighting some similarities be-\ntween Juror 5o’s sexual abuse and the sexual abuse\ndiscussed at trial. (Br.67). That falls far short of re-\nquiring the District Court to imply bias. First, as\nJudge Nathan explained, the law is not that “bias must\nbe implied when a juror has a personal experience sim-\nilar to the issues at trial.” (A.349). Rather, this Court\nhas “consistently refused to create a set of unreasona-\nbly constricting presumptions that jurors be excused\nfor cause due to certain occupational or other special\nrelationships which might bear directly or indirectly\non the circumstances of a given case.” (A.349 (quoting\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46)). This case is not within one of\nthe rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory\npresumption of bias applies. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d\nat 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Second, although there\nare some similarities between Juror 5o’s childhood\nsexual abuse, there are also differences: Juror 5o was\nyounger than the trial victims at the time of their\nabuse, he was abused by a family member, and he dis-\nclosed his abuse much earlier.

If our personality differences\nthreaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case\nwhom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights.\nIn the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to\nbegin preparing a revised indictment package containing your\nsuggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by\nEpstein’s atorneys. ...

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.”! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafania Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n7o Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\nn Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023212.tif": "The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span>, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030506.jpg": "g ALAN M.

Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033225.tif": "breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which atests to the playful side of\nJeffrey’s nature:\nIn high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were\nJokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just\ndidn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed\nteacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were\n“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing\ngrade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it\nwas too late. After lo minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff\nconvinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until\ngraduation. Well, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class\nevery day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the\nclass did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we\ngraduated.\nEisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the\nfollouing words:\nOver the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success\nunatainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No mater hou busy he ever is, no\nmater where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,\nhe was always there. As we’ve goten older, our lives have become more\ncomplicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our\nbirthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but hou many childhood friends do you\nknou, who have never forgoten your birthday? The most important thing\nto me is that as vast a <span class=\"highlight\">difference</span> [as] aur worlds are, our long-term, deep\nseated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;\nit’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even\nfamily. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only\nones who could comprehend this special relationship.\nJeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his\nadulthood. In about l98l, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (nou Andersson-Dubin), then 2o,\nwho was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still\nenduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.\nDuring that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He\nencouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She\nreported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with\nher studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to\n. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and\npresently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.\n5\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33225\n"};
