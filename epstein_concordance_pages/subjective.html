What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred.

The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in interstate and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government nou concedes that when it alleges that Epstein “sexually abused”\nAccuser-3 with Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and assistance, the purported “sexual abuse” to which\nthe government refers was entirely lawful conduct—and that the sole basis for the government’s\ncharacterization of that lawful conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span>\nexperience” of consensual sex acts. Opp. l62 n.57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,\ngrossly misleading. As the government argued in a 2ol7 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual\nabuse” implies a crime. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)\n(“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i/legal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger\nthan l8 years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Merriam-Webster’s legal\ndictionary defines “sexual abuse” as (l) “the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by\nforcible compulsion,” (il) “engaging in sexual contact with a person who is belou a specified age\nor who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity,” or (i)\n“the crime of engaging in or inflicting sexual abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com\nLegal Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps:/(www.merriam-webster.com/legal/sexual%2oabuse,\naccessed ll Mar. 2o2l.\n\nAlthough the government concedes its inability to establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\ninteractions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful, it\ninsists that it has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading\nnor prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. l65. The\ngovernment’s rationale is baseless and untenable: Since the government has alleged that lawful\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pageloofl4\nconduct involving Accuser-3 was an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, it argues that it is\nentitled to imply that the conduct itself was unlawful. The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span>\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagel2oofl4\nil. At Minimum, the Government Must Demonstrate the Admissibility of Evidence\n\nRegarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nThe government apparently does not dispute its obligation to demonstrate the\nadmissibility of Accuser-3’s testimony as “other act” evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\nLitigation of the admissibility of this evidence is premature, and Ms. Maxwell reserves the right\nto challenge it at the appropriate juncture. Ms. Maxwell notes, houever, that the government’s\nargument that such evidence is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) suffers from the same\nflaws as its argument that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions regarding Accuser-3 constitute an overt\nact.\n\nThe government claims Accuser-3’s testimony is admissible to shou Ms. Maxwell’s\n“knouledge, intent, and modus operandi.” Opp. l58 (emphasis in original). The government’s\nvery use of those terms, houever, betrays an implication that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with\nAccuser-3 were somehou unlawful. Any knouledge or intent on Ms. Maxwell’s part that\nEpstein would engage in consensual sexual activity with Accuser-3, or any method by which she\npurportedly persuaded Accuser-3 to engage in such lawful conduct, has no bearing on whether\nMs. Maxwell knew or intended Accuser-l or Accuser-2 to engage in unlawful sexual activity.\nAnd Accuser-3’s proffered testimony about her “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience” of her lawful,\nconsensual activity with Epstein certainly would not inform the jury as to Ms. Maxwell’s state of\nmind or conduct with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span>—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.

Accordingly, Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was a minor when she traveled or when she\nallegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the United States.\n\nDespite having been alerted to the problems with Accuser-3’s evidence, the government\nrepeated the same allegations related to Accuser-3 in the second superseding indictment filed\nafter the pretrial motions were fully briefed. See S2 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. l87) (“S2\nIndictment”) §f[ 9(c), l3(d), l9(d).

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)).

Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8S. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (‘Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added).

Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject.

And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”).

It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein.

Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

(Ex. A at 3).\n\ne “[G]rooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that there is\nno valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” (/d. at 4\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)).\n\ne “In any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming\nhas occurred is a <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> judgment hinging largely on the credibility of individuals.\nSuch judgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced.”\n\ne “There is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third parties,” and it is not\naccepted in the relevant community. “[I]t has not and cannot be tested; and there is no\nknoun or potential rate of error.”\n\ne The notion that “individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse” is ‘“‘a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is “not\nbased on empirical data.”\n\nAs explained belou, the Government agrees that Dr. Dietz may offer an opinion on the difficulty\nof accurately determining whether an act constitutes grooming, in response to Dr. Rocchio.\nAlthough his remaining opinions purport to respond to Dr. Rocchio, houever, they are themselves\nunreliable or invade the province of the jury, and should be precluded.\n\nBeyond his response to Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, Dr. Dietz offers several additional\nopinions, to which the Government objects as discussed herein. As to “hindsight bias,” Dr. Dietz\nopines:\n\ne Hindsight bias, or “the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an\n\nevent is after being informed about the outcome of an event,” exists and has been found\nin various experiments.

Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span>. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span>—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span>\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d.

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6643\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i//egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of child\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] reliability .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited).

Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities.

And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

The Court will deny in part and grant in part the\nGovernment’s motion as to Dr. Dietz.\n\nTo start, several of Dr. Dietz’s opinions criticize the basis of Dr. Rocchio’s grooming\nopinion. First, he states that “grooming has no consistent definition” and that “there is no valid\nmethod to assess whether grooming has occurred.” Notice at 4. The Government agrees that\nthis opinion is relevant to respond to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and is otherwise admissible.\n\nGov’t Br. at 9. The Court agrees.\n\nSecond, Dr. Dietz states that studies of grooming have “no knoun error rate” and “cannot\nbe tested” because they rely on the reports of alleged victims. Notice at 4. The Government\ndoes not expressly respond to this opinion except to say that Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions similarly lack error rates. Gov’t Br. at 36. The Court concludes that this criticism of\nDr. Rocchio’s grooming opinion is relevant and admissible.\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz would provide several opinions about the relationship between grooming\nand intent. He states that the term grooming “imputes motive and intent without adequate\nevidence of either,” that it “imput[es] motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “there is\nconsiderable risk of misleading the fact finder in believing that” innocent conduct is grooming,\nand that a determination of grooming is a “<span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> judgment.” Notice at 3-4. The\nGovernment argues that these opinions are inadmissible because it is the jury’s role to determine\nthe Defendant’s intent. Gov’t Br. at lo-ll. Rule 7o4(b) “expressly forbids opinion testimony\nby an expert as to the state of mind of a defendant in a criminal case where that mental state is an\nelement of the crime.” United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d l2o6, l2l5 (2d Cir. l992) (citing Fed.

Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that effect would plainly violate Rule 7o4(b). The\nCourt therefore precludes these three aspects of Dr. Dietz’s opinion as well as any other\ntestimony that would similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming and\ninstead suggest that there is inadequate evidence of intent in this case.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that there is not empirical data on whether minors with particular\nvulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d. at 4. The\nGovernment responds that this opinion itself is unsupported in the academic literature. Gov’t Br.\nat ll. If experts disagree on the proper interpretation of evidence, “it is not the Court’s role to\nresolve the dispute through exclusion of one of the expert’s opinions.” Jn re Digital Music\nAntitrust Litig., 32l F.R.D. 64, 8o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). The Court concludes that Dr. Dietz’s\nextensive experience in the field provides an adequate basis for this opinion criticizing Dr.\nRocchio’s opinion. It therefore admits this opinion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 24 of 82\n\nl Instruction No. l7: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — Third\n\n2 Element\n\n3 The third element of Count Two which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable\n\n4 doubt is that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual\n\n5 activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law.\n\n6 “Intentionally” Defined\n\n7 A person acts intentionally when the act is the product of her conscious objective, that is,\n\n8 when she acts deliberately and purposefully and not because of a mistake or accident.

A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility).

When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission.

Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> test like actual\nknouledge.

As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 _ Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\nIndictment occurred in 2oo4. It is Ms. Maxwell’s position that any post-2oo4 statements by\nEpstein or other alleged co-conspirators were not in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue in this\ncase.\n\nThe first exemplar is a statement allegedly from Epstein to CC-l claiming that Ms.\nMaxwell “used to find girls for him.” This statement, or statements like it, cannot have been\nmade either in the course of or in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue here and are no more\nthan “idle chater.” Casual conversation about “past events,” “idle chater” between co-\nconspirators, or “merely narrative descriptions by one coconspirator of the acts of another” do\nnot qualify as statements in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Heinemann, 8ol F.2d\n86, 95 (2d Cir. l986); United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95, lo2 (2d Cir. l98o) (challenged\ntestimony “smack[ed] of nothing more than casual conversation about past events. It is difficult\nto envision hou it would have furthered the conspiracy.”).\n\nDuring 2oo5, according to the witness, she, Sarah Kellen, an (and\nothers) were actively involved in soliciting females for Jeffrey Epstein. At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the conclusion that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said.

Formal interviews were\nnot conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations\nby other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special\nInvestigative Staff follouing a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since\nthe original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the\nbeginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely\nlimited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm <span class=\"highlight\">subjective</span> reports, establish\nconverging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,\ninformation typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support\nactionable findings and recommendations is limited.\n\nName: Jeffrey Epstein\n\nRegister Number: 763l8-o54\n\nDate of Death: o8-lo-2ol9\n\nPrepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator,\n\nPsychology Services Branch, Central Office\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nMr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August lo, 2ol9, while housed\nat the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York.

Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.

He\nsmiled and remarked, \"welcome back\" when this writer arrived.\nwhen this writer atempted to get a more detailed account from him, indicating that it would be rare to have\nsuch impairments in memory as he does not suffer from an acute cognitive disorder, he smiled and said he understood\nmy position.\nInmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it \"a\npunishment cell.\" He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong. Inmate Epstein\nstated he feels it is dangerous in the SHU, he cannot sleep well up there due to noise from the other inmates, it smells,\nand it is difficult for him to work on his legal case up there. He stated he has not received the phone calls he was\npromised nor has he been able to receive recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the\natorney conference room and it is likely that he has missed the times when staff members have atempted to give him\nphone calls and recreation. Inmate Epstein also reported complaints about the atorney conference room, stating they\ndo not take him to the bathroom frequently enough.\nInmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating \"| am too vested in my case to fight it, | have a life\nand | want to go back to living my life.\" He denied any acute symptoms at this time.\nAccording to his log book, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has\nalso been atending his daily legal visits.\nIntervention(s)\nInmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping\nstrategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was mostly receptive to these interventions. He requested to be housed in general\npopulation rather than the SHU and stated he wanted to remain on psychological observation due to his concerns with\nbeing in the SHU.\nProgress/Plan\nIn an abundance of caution, inmate Epstein will remain on psychological observation.\npsychological observation.\nCompleted by\" |PhD/Chief Psychologist on o7/25/2ol9 lo:43\nGenerated o7/25/2ol9 lo:43 bfPxe: (XTC) PhD/Chiet Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page l of l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027373.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons “SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED**\nPsychology Services\nClinical Intervention - Clinical Contact\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: Mi.
