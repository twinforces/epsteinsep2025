The fact that evidence may\nbe lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment stage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the\nduration. Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the <span class=\"highlight\">destruction</span> of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate pre-trial\npublicity from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation. The defendant\ncites not one case in support of her argument that pre-trial publicity can ever establish actual\nprejudice, nor does she point to any evidence that the Government fomented such publicity dating\nback to 2oll. To the extent the defendant is concerned about pretrial publicity, she will have the\nopportunity to propose an appropriate examination of potential jurors during voir dire to identify\na panel of impartial jurors who have not been prejudiced by any publicity this case may have\ngarnered.\n\nIn short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,\nspeculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay.'!? The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide discovery adequate\nto fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in discovery are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment.

And, once again, the government has turned a blind eye to the existence of the\njournal, refusing to collect clearly relevant and exculpatory evidence.\n\nThis type of evidence, “journals,” or “diaries” is, without question, exculpatory material\nthat the government would have to provide to the defense in advance of trial if it were in their\npossession. The government’s failure to obtain the journal contravenes Second Circuit law:\n\nIf the diary had contained exculpatory information or other material that would\n\nhave been useful to the defense for the purpose of impeaching [the witness’s]\n\ncredibility, the government would have been required under Brady v. Maryland,\nsupra, to turn over such material to the defense. See, e.g., United States v. Seijo,\n\n5l4 F.2d l357 (2d Cir. l975). By allouing a potential source of such material to\n\nremain in the possession of the very witness whose credibility it might be used to\n\nimpeach, the government created a serious risk that significant material would be\n\ndestroyed or tampered with.[*]Under the circumstances, the diary should have been\n\nimpounded with the court, subject to use and inspection by both sides under\n\nconditions that would protect the defendants from <span class=\"highlight\">destruction</span> or alteration, and the\n\nwitness from unwarranted invasions of privacy or disclosure of information that\n\nmight jeopardize his safety.

Judge Sweet made no specific findings about any provision\nof that order. Ud. 9:25—lo:6.)\n\nOn March l8, 2ol6, the court formally entered the Protective Order. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. )\nNo. 62.) It provided, as such orders generally do, that any documents, materials and/or |\ninformation designated confidential by the parties (the “Confidential Materials”) would be |\nsubject to the protections of, and could be disclosed to non-parties only in accordance with the |\nterms of, the Protective Order. (Id. §§ l-5.) The Protective Order also required all parties, at the |\nconclusion of the case, either to return to the party who made the confidentiality designation, or |\n(in the alternative) to destroy, each document and all copies of Confidential Materials in their |\npossession. (Ic. 5-7, l2.) This <span class=\"highlight\">destruction</span> obligation extended to the parties’ lawyers as well |\nas to the parties themselves. Ud. § l2.) |\nThe Protective Order specified that if Confidential Materials were contained in any |\ndocument presented to the court, the filing “shall be accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant |\nto Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of |\nNew York.” (/d. $lo.) The docket sheet in Giuffre v. Maxwell reveals that such motions were |\nfrequently made and routinely granted. As a result, a vast amount of the Giuffre Action was |\nconducted, in effect, in secret—despite the fact that there was immense public interest in the |\nmater. | |\nThe Giuffre Action was setled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint |\nstipulation for dismissal on May 25, 2ol7, which was shortly before the trial was to begin. (l5- .\nev-7433, Dkt. No. 9l9.) The terms of the setlement remain confidential. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt.

State of N.Y., 779 F.2d 86l, 862 (2d\n\nCir. l985) (considering appeal where the New York State Atorney General, rather than the :\nsubject of the subpoena, was the moving party). |\nDuring the conference, the Government was not able to explain why it, rather than Boies |\nSchiller, made the application, Boies Schiller is perfectly capable of protecting its oun interests.\nThe law firm’s failure to seek for itself permission to respond to the subpoena seems particularly |\nmysterious in light of the fact that it has filed papers on behalf of Giuffre, in both the district and |\nappellate proceedings, supporting the intervenors’ applications to unseal the entire record, See, |\ne.g., Br. for Pl.-Appellee Virginia L. Giuffre, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir. Dec. 27, |\n2ol8), ECF No. 83 at l (“Ms. Giuffre . . . is nou prepared to have the world see what the record\ncontains.”). I suppose that Boies Schiller might not want to seem too cooperative with the |\n~ Government, especially if it is concerned about ending up as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging |\nbreach of contract if it has failed to return or destroy the Confidential Materials in its possession. |\nSee Aioi Nissay Doua Ins. Co. v. ProSight Specialty Mgmt. Co., No. l2-cv-3274, 2ol2 WL |\n3583l76, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2l, 2ol2). But that does not strike this Court as a reason for the |\nGovernment to carry the firm’s water—the moreso because Judge Sweet ruled some months |\nbefore he died that the intervenors’ appeals in Giuffre meant the lawsuit had not “concluded,” ,\nand so had postponed the day when that contractual obligation kicked in. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n967 at 6.)\na This ruling came in response to a motion by Maxwell to compel Giuffre’s compliance with the document\n<span class=\"highlight\">destruction</span> provision. It argued that Giuffre’s obligations thereunder were triggered at the time of setlement. (l5- :\nmm Dkt. Nos. 957.) Judge Sweet denied that motion in light of the pending appeals. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo88l |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo493l |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\n<span class=\"highlight\">destruction</span> of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 29\n\nl22 J.

The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v.

In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o.

The defendant’s claim is entirely speculative; she makes no\nclaim about what Carolyn’s phone records, or those of her mother or then-boyfriend, would have\nshoun, and she ignores that the records may well have helped the Government, not her, if they\nwere available.\n\nAs another example, the defendant argues that had the flight manifests been available for\nthe time period charged in the Indictment, '® she “could have used them to challenge whether Jane\nwas on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s recollection of events.” (/d. at 26).

(Tr. l72). Similarly, Rodgers\ntestified that he turned over the passenger manifests that he completed to one of Epstein’s\natorneys. (Tr. l8l9). The defendant has not established that such manifests were not available\ndue to any intentionally manufactured delay. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l,\nlo94 (S.D.N.Y. l973) (“The fact that evidence may be lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment\nstage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the duration.

I posted FAQs on the EVCP website that address the scope and\nassurance of confidentiality. A copy of the EVCP FAQs is atached to the motion as Exhibit E\n(see Questions 5, 6 and ll). I also issued several press releases during the claims process that\nhighlight confidentiality as a “cornerstone” of the EVCP and of “paramount importance.”\nCopies of EVCP press releases are atached as Exhibits B, C, and F. Through numerous public\nforums, confidentiality was discussed as a centerpiece of the Program.\n\nll. The express condition of confidentiality significantly informed the way I\nadministered the Program and approached the claims process. I implemented a trauma-informed\nprocess where claimants could share information freely and openly without feeling the need to\ncensor themselves - not only about the events that gave rise to the claim but also the often\nprofound impact on their lives. I spent months building trust and confidence in this alternative\ndispute resolution process among claimants and their atorneys — a process that was new and\nunfamiliar to many of them. I dispensed with formal rules of procedure or evidence that would\napply in a court of law in favor of a less formal, non-adversarial approach.
