Epstein, l9-cr-49o (RMB) and U.S. v.\nMaxwell, 2o-cr-33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,\n\nWe write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from\nthe Department of Justice on July 25, 2o25, advising that the Court is seeking leters on behalf of\nvictims seting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!\n\nBy the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s actions. To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n\n‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n? Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas <span class=\"highlight\">Boulevard</span>, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo766", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001179.jpg": "CaSesk2Zo-ef (ooS 2os AdTen (Dec ante) l6o2l, RRB 52ol d729 e Rage l66f 2\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\n— FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nRule l7 Subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) in further support of its objections\nto Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s motion for an order authorizing a subpoena to BSF pursuant to\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the “Subpoena”).! As the Defendant’s\nresponse makes clear, she seeks to serve a Rule l7 subpoena on BSF because she is dissatisfied\nwith the Government’s discovery efforts thus far. Thus, she is using Rule l7 to atempt to obtain\ndiscovery that she has been unable to obtain from the Government under Rule l6 and Brady,\nincluding discovery that is subject to a pending motion before the Court. This is an improper use\nof a Rule l7 subpoena. If the Defendant believes that the Government has not fulfilled its\ndiscovery obligations under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, she must address that issue with the\nGovernment and the Court rather than serving overbroad and burdensome subpoenas on third\nparties. And if the Defendant is not entitled to the discovery she seeks from the Government, then\n: The Defendant refers to BSF’s objections as a “motion to quash,” but the Court has not yet\ngranted Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena to BSF. BSF thus requests that the\nDefendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena be denied.\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas <span class=\"highlight\">Boulevard</span>, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 8954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004213.jpg": "Casask lg -Qn8IaRARW SPasuauenemehes FidecbeWmeMs! pdgacerts afl2\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI certify that on June 6, 2ol6, I electronically served this Defendant's Response in Opposition to\nMotion to Exceed Presumptive Ten Deposition Limit via ECF on the follouing:\nSigrid S.

You meticulously convinced me through your deceptive charm and conversation that you\nwere someone worthy of my bright and inspired young mind to look up to. You crafted your impact\non me. You groomed me. Then, you sent me off to another monster. I trusted you. You had\ngroomed me so well, I unsuspectingly walked myself to the home of that monster. I walked myself\nto the home of that predator that hurt me. You manipulated and betrayed me into feeling and\nbelieving that I was safe.\n\nOne of the most devastating outcomes to you hurting me is hou I then began to view and\ntreat myself. I began to view myself as unworthy of love. I began treating myself as the garbage I\nwas regarded as. My life got so dark, the despair so intense, I nearly did not make it out alive. Do\nyou even remember me?\n\nI am on the outside of prison walls. Freedom. Yet, I will forever fight for the freedom that\nyou callously stole from me.\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas <span class=\"highlight\">Boulevard</span>, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfllp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo674", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010676.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page l4 of 29\nBOIES\nSGHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAnnie Farmer submits the follouing statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed\n\nmotion for bail.\nis 2K 3\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this mater and once more\nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

With regard to the depositions of our clients, it is necessary and\nappropriate for the entry of a court order which would require that one deposition be taken of\neach of our clients for use in both the criminal case and the civil case. A single deposition is\nwarranted given that the facts of the sexual assault are common to both the civil and criminal\ncases, and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is the same in both cases. A single deposition is in the\nbest interests of the emotional well being of the victim. In another case we were involved in\nwhere both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Atorney’s office filed a\nmotion for protective order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(l)(l) asking that\nthe depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time.\n\nWe would like to coordinate and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue\nconceming the depositions of our clients. The deposition of is presently\nscheduled for Wednesday, April 2, 2oo8. Please let us knou hou you would like to proceed in\nthis important mater as soon as possible.\n\nStuart S.

Anyone\nwho reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to\nobject on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking\nobjections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.\nBEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you\nfiled against Mr. Epstein for $5o,ooo,ooo.oo [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.\nll. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your\navailability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation\nplans.\n\nFinally, your leter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The\ndeposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of\nherself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —\nwere numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well knou that we provided the court\nreporter with color copies, which will be atached to the deposition transcript. You also\nknou that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the\ndeposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs\nwhen you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,\nlast week after she was already under subpoena.\n\nI hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.\nVery truly ygurs,\n\nf\nMichaeRR.

The next call occurred at 5:5o pm when the\nvictim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after\nthe above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson.\nFurther analysis shoued no telephone calls to either Robson s cellular\ntelephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6,\n2oo5.\nAdditionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from\n3o5-7lo-5l65.

I explained that although she is seventeen\nyears old I needed to inform her parents that she would be\ninterviewed. She provided her home telephone number. I atempted\ncontact and left voice mail messages at the house to speak with her\nparents.\nDet. Caristo and I then iocat es at her residence located\nat j West Palm Beach. I atempted to interview her\nabout Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff\nEpstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she\nwould not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She\nasked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did\nnot wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point\nin the investigation to knou she was at Epstein's house and provided\ngirls to Epstein to work. I also explained that prior to our arrival\nat her residence I had telephone contact with her father ,guupps\nMe «WhO was told she would be interviewed. pa is\ncurrently seventeen years old and as a juvenile, parental notification\n| would be required. We then left the area and returned to the police\n| station.\n| While at the police station, I left another telephone message for\nMEME parents. I began an analysis of Sarah Kellen's Cellular\ntelephone. The telephone number 9l7-855-3363 is assigned to Sarah\nKellen and the financially responsible party is Jeffrey Epstein of 457\nMadison Ave. in New York City, New York. The time frame which was\nsubpoenaed was September 2oo5, through October 2oo5. There were\neighty seven pages of calls made either to the cell phone or from the\ncell phone. The local (56l) numbers were analyzed. A spread sheet\nwas prepared and placed into the atachment file of who was called.\nThe unknoun numbers were researched using FoneFinder.com and subpoenas\nwere requested to determine subscriber information. This was done to\nidentify additional victims or witnesses. The analysis revealed that :\nKellen had called the victim/witnesses frequently when Epstein was in\nthe Toun of Palm Beach to \"work.\" This confirms what the girls\ninterviewed had previously stated. Kellen would notify them when\nEpstein was in toun and their willingness to \"work.\" The CD was placed\ninto evidence.\nInvestigation Continues.\nKEK KKK KEKE KR KEKE KKK KKKEKEKEKEEK NA RRA TIVE # ZO KERR KEKKKEKKEKEKEKKKEKKAEKEKEKKEEKE\nReported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH l/o3/o6\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. l/o3/o6\nOn December 29, 2oo5, I received a facsimile from National Compliance\no7/267 Page 2588 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo329ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032928.jpg": ",\nDTG OPERATIONS dba DOLLAR RENT A CAR VEH.#: 8l7622-l\n24ol Turnage <span class=\"highlight\">Boulevard</span> LIC. #: W28GIS STALLA: l2/23/2oo5 lo4o HHll5484-5\nWest Palm Beach, FL ooooo33 o5 NISSAN SENTRA\n866-434-2226 Rate: WALK Cls: CDAR 92oool TIME OUT TIME IN\nFUEL LEVEL OUT: FULL ll/26/2oo5 lo48\nMILEAGE OUT: ll23o **RENTAL RATES** EST CHG\nHours l2.oo/ mls\nCUSTOMER DECLINES LDW AND IS RESPON- Days 24.99/ mls\nSIBLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE PER TERMS Weeks l24.95/ mls 499.8o\nOF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT.
