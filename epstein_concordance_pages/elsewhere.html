Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).

All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000340.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l2 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

This Court should follou\nother courts in this Circuit and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> that have found that defendants rebuted the\npresumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged\noffenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2o2o WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres,\nNo. 3:2o-CR-l8-J-32JBT, 2o2o WL lo42o5l, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2o2o); Conway,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *4-5.\n\nThe Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government... .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\n<span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 24 of 38\noffenses at issue will be “instituted in this District.” NPA at 2 (emphases added). In addition,\nthe use of the term “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity provision contrasts with\nthe use <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the agreement of various terms that refer more specifically to the USAO-\nSDFL. When the government wanted a provision of the NPA to refer only to the USAO-SDFL,\nit knew hou to do so; where it chose not to do so, a different intent is demonstrated.\n\nIndeed, the omission of express language limiting the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL was contrary to Justice Department policy. The Justice Manual (formerly the U.S.\nAtorneys’ Manual) expressly provides, and provided at the time the NPA was executed, that “if\npracticable, the atorney for the government should explicitly limit the scope of his/her [non-\nprosecution] agreement to non-prosecution within his/her district.” Justice Manual, Comment to\n§ 9-27.63o. The government’s deviation from a policy of which it was obviously aware—for\noffenses that, by their nature, involve interstate travel and are susceptible to prosecution in\nmultiple districts—cannot be regarded as an oversight, particularly where the policy was\nfolloued <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the NPA with respect to the immunity provision as to Epstein.\n\nDe United States v. Annabi does not alter the analysis.\n\nIn support of its position, the government has cited United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o\n(2d Cir. l985). Reply Mem. at 5. But Annabi does not support the government’s position. In\nfact, to the extent it is relevant here, it supports dismissal.\n\nIn Annabi, the government, follouing a guilty plea to one count of a three-count\nindictment in the Eastern District of New York, agreed to move to dismiss the two open counts.\nUnlike here, there was no writen agreement; rather, the prosecutor stated on the record at the\ntime of the plea that “the only agreement that exists between the defendants and the Government\nis that at the time of the imposition of sentence on Count Two, the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts as to each defendant.” 77l F.2d at 67l.

The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\nthe district court. /d. “In deciding whether a bill of particulars is needed, the court must\ndetermine whether the information sought has been provided <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>, such as in other items\nprovided by discovery, responses made to requests for particulars, prior proceedings, and the\nindictment itself.” United States v.

Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here.

Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S.

Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action.

And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def.

In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial.

Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him.

The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s\nexclusionary rule.

The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [<span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel4of23\nalternative explanation for this difference in terminology, reasonable or otherwise—presumably\nbecause it cannot.\n\nThus, a drafting prosecutor who intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL clearly knew hou to do so, using either of two methods employed <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the\ndocument. The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not.

It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a reasonable alternative explanation for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision. But to the extent there remains any doubt, plea\nagreements must be construed “strictly against the government,” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89\n(internal citations omited), and the government is held “responsible for imprecisions or\nambiguities in the agreement.” United States v. Padilla, l86 F.3d l36, l42 (2d Cir. l999).\nWhile the government argues that Annabi relieves it of this responsibility where the\n“imprecisions or ambiguities” relate to the geographic applicability of a plea agreement (Opp. 6\nn.2), it cites no authority for this proposition. While Annabi requires an affirmative appearance\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel5of23\nthat the NPA is binding outside the SDFL, any ambiguity as to whether such an appearance\nexists must still be resolved against the government.°\n\nNor does the idea that the government agreed to broader immunity for Epstein’s potential\nco-conspirators than for Epstein himself “strain[] common sense,” as the government argues.\nSee Opp. 8.

Under such circumstances, any\ncompetent defense lawyer would have sought the broadest immunity possible for Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators, in order to limit the potential that he would become embroiled in the\nprosecution of a third party—and in fact, Epstein did not agree to the NPA until the co-\nconspirator immunity provision was included. And it is entirely logical that the government\nagreed to a broader immunity for potential co-conspirators, whom it had no interest in\nprosecuting, than for Epstein himself, who was the sole focus of the government’s prosecution\nefforts. This outcome is consistent with the language of the NPA.\n\nThe text of the NPA, read as a whole, thus creates an affirmative appearance that the co-\nconspirator immunity provision is not limited to the SDFL, and it is unnecessary for the Court to\n° Notwithstanding the mountain of authority, in this Circuit and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>, articulating the exacting standards to\nwhich the government is to be held in negotiating a plea agreement, the government implies that such standards\nsomehou do not apply when the plea agreement is enforced by a third party.

The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity\nof the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly\nauthenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use,\nwhat kind of examination will occur, or hou that examination might bear on the journal’s\nauthenticity. See Wey, 252 F.

Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [<span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a legitimate defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet proffered.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\nRelevance of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and relevance of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 54\nUnited States v. Castro, 8l3 F.2d 57l, 575-76 (2d Cir. l987)). But this doctrine “has never\nrequired the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to\nthe admited passages.” United States v. Williams, 93o F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omited); see id. at 6l (“[T]he rule of completeness does not\nrequire the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all circumstances.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not introduce a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony.

And unless they accomplish the narrou function of the rule of\ncompleteness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such\nstatements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the\ndefense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each\ntrial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be\naddressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such\nstatements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2\ndisclosures.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo544o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 4o\na\nevery reason to believe that, if the Court orders that Minor Victims be permited to testify under\npseudonyms, many major publications will honor that request and not rebroadcast the Minor\nVictims’ names should they surface <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>. The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections.

The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> (see, e.g. Def.

What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006013.jpg": ": 4 |\nCas@ds2oLcr8oo88o422EPGOooneises5 Fileday iG@Aas2 PagPdgefaof ll\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK |\n---- ------ eee - - = Kk |\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\na/k/a “Brent English,” : a oe) |\nDefendant. :\nee:\nCOUNT ONE -\n(Conspiracy to Engage in Sex Trafficking of Minors)\nThe Grand Jury charges:\nl.

These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a legitimate defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet proffered.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\nRelevance of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and relevance of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 54\nUnited States v. Castro, 8l3 F.2d 57l, 575-76 (2d Cir. l987)). But this doctrine “has never\nrequired the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to\nthe admited passages.” United States v. Williams, 93o F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omited); see id. at 6l (“[T]he rule of completeness does not\nrequire the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all circumstances.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not introduce a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony. To the extent the defendant wishes\nto offer her oun out-of-court statements, they are hearsay, whether in emails, deposition\ntranscripts, or <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>. And unless they accomplish the narrou function of the rule of\ncompleteness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such\nstatements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the\ndefense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each\ntrial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be\naddressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such\nstatements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2\ndisclosures.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006533.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 4o\na\nevery reason to believe that, if the Court orders that Minor Victims be permited to testify under\npseudonyms, many major publications will honor that request and not rebroadcast the Minor\nVictims’ names should they surface <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>. The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections. And in any event, even marginally reduced exposure is significant to the Minor\nVictims.° There is a very meaningful difference between the names of victims appearing in some\ndark corner of the internet, and the names of the victims appearing in the news outlets that will be\nviewed by the friends, families (including children), and employers of the Minor Victims.\n\nD. The Defendant Has No Countervailing Interests at Stake, Much Less a Particularized\n\nNeed for Disclosure.\n\nIn the context of the disclosure of witness identifying information, the Second Circuit has\nidentified two primary interests of defendants: “(l) obtaining information needed for in-court and\nout-of-court investigation of the witness; and (2) enabling defense counsel to elicit information\nee\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6533\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006938.jpg": ": 4 |\nCas@ds2oLcr8oo88o422EP G@OoonentethB5 FiledayibiH2 PagPdgefaof ll\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK |\n---- ------ eee - - = Kk |\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\na/k/a “Brent English,” : a oe) |\nDefendant. :\nee:\nCOUNT ONE -\n(Conspiracy to Engage in Sex Trafficking of Minors)\nThe Grand Jury charges:\nl.

Quite the contrary. The policies and actions\nimplemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from\npunishment and unreasonable searches.

The\ndifference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature.

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “massage.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at\nthe time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this mater\nand avoiding the trauma of testifying again.

Alessi worked for Epstein at his Palm Beach house from\napproximately l99o until approximately 2oo2. Alessi has explained that, during his employment,\nhe observed a contact book with a dark blue or black cover, which cover was blank, and with many\nentries printed in black ink on white paper.

The book was bound, and Alessi was\ninstructed to put identical copies of it on Epstein and the defendant’s desks and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> around\nthe Palm Beach house.” During the course of his employment for Epstein Alessi reviewed multiple\nversions of the book: the book was replaced annually with new versions, and the old versions are\ndestroyed. Alessi observed both the defendant and Epstein use the contact book.\n\nWhen the Government shoued Alessi Government Exhibit 52 tonight, Alessi recognized\nit as a copy of the contact book he had previously described. See 35o4-o47. Alessi identified the\nbook by the cover, binding, formating, and variation in the entries. Alessi also reviewed the\nentries inside the book and identified numerous entries as containing contact information for\nindividuals that he specifically recalls being included in the copies of the books he remembers\nseeing in Palm Beach. That includes the entry for the witness testifying as “Jane,” see GX 52-F,\nand the entry for Florida masseuses—including some of the individuals on that list, see GX 52-G.\nAlthough this version of the contact book post-dates his employment with Epstein, Alessi was able\nto determine that fact in part by noticing that his oun contact information had been removed from\nthe book.’\n\nD Alesel alae explained that thane were two similar-looking books, one for Epstein and one for the\ndefendant.\n3 Alessi generally recalls the book being thicker and featuring a larger font size.

That is\na time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving multiple agencies in each\ncountry that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the conclusion of trial. And there is\nevery reason for the Government to seek to investigate this document: the defendant has previously\ntestified, under oath in a deposition, that she lived at the Kinnerton Street address beginning in\nl992 or l993. (See Exhibit B at 8). Such an investigation did not become necessary until the\ndefendant sought to introduce a document in support of an apparent argument that, contrary to that\ntestimony, the defendant lived <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> prior to the purchase of this home.\n\nFourth, no remedy other than preclusion is appropriate.

But at no time has the defendant elicited testimony from\nJane, Kate, Carolyn, or Annie that they were asked such questions or subject to such pressure.\nAccordingly, testimony from Dr. Loftus on that point does not fit the facts of the case and has no\nprobative value. It also would substantially prejudice the Government by suggesting to the jury—\nwithout evidence—that the Government or a therapist manufactured false memories in the Minor\nVictims. Dr. Loftus’s opinion on suggestive activities therefore should not contain testimony\nabout Government questioning or response pressure exerted by therapists.\n\nV.

Some of them are in the United States, like John Jay\n\nl9 College of Criminal Justice, which is one of the honorary\n2o doctorates. But I also have an honorary doctorate from a\n2l British university, from -- actually, I think a couple of\n22 British universities, from the University of Oslo, from Haifa\n23 University in Israel. And I was supposed to be awarded an\n24 honorary doctorate by an Australian university, Australian\n25 National University, where I was supposed to go to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool3965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l of 95 2759\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl the conspiracy counts come later, I think there is an atempt\n\n2 here to generalize the wording of the elements because it's\n\n3 going to be applied later to the conspiracy counts, right?

In defining the enhancement, the\n\n3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of\n\n4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over\n\n5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's\n\n6 behavior. 2Gl.l, comment note 7.

The doctrine is based on the\ndistrict court’s supervisory authority over the grand juries it empanels. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at\nlo2 & n.2. It today is recognized in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special circumstances’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe disclosure;\n\n(i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 84l (8th Cir. 2oo9); Pitch v.\nUnited States, 953 F.3d l226, l24l (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 624\n(2o2o). The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its historical importance), and In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 3l4, 33o-36\n(D.D.C. 2ol8) (ordering disclosure of some grand jury materials related to the investigation of\nPresident Clinton’s business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern), with In re\nShepard, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 37, 39-4o (D.D.C. 2oll) (denying as overbroad request for disclosure\nof all testimony and materials associated with every witness before three Watergate grand juries),\nand In re Nichter, 949 F. Supp. 2d 2o5, 2l2-l3 (D.D.C. 2ol3) (denying disclosure of certain\ngrand jury records about Watergate because at least one subject of the testimony was still alive).\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015230.jpg": "Loftus, E.F.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nApp.o6o\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019895.jpg": "CaS 922 lcrDdSSCUAUIN DstamteHPl &-Pitdd B77 POH Page St 2o\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64.

It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F.

Abbasi, l37 S. Ct.\nl843, l857, l859 (2ol7)). In this case, the District Court did not just purport to\nfollou Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable\nterritory. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct\nfrom 2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA. Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count\nSix.\n\nThird, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no\n“affirmative” indication whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021095.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page48 of ll3\nother offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury\ninvestigation.” Al44. Consequently, the charge is not “sufficiently distinct,”\nAnnabi does not apply, and the USAO-SDNY was bound by the NPA not to bring\nthis charge. Count Six should be dismissed.\n\n4. There is affirmative indication that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY\n\nThe Annabi rule’s presumption is unavailing by its oun terms where “it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\nAnnabi at 672.\n\nHere, the “affirmative appearance” that a broader restriction was intended\nfor co-conspirators is evident within the four corners of the NPA, when the NPA is\nviewed as a whole. Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in\nwriten form and was carefully negotiated by sophisticated counsel. The absence of\nany limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp\ncontrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is\nexpressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” Al75. It is difficult to envision a\nclearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the\nagreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here. Basic principles of\ncontract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered the inclusion\nof the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021124.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/7 of ll3\n2oo5).

Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea.

Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span> in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason).

Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators\neasily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language.

In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea.

The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence.

The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and <span class=\"highlight\">elsewhere</span>. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223\n"};
