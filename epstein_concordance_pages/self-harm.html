On Friday, June 24, 2o22, the Warden of the MDC was informed that the\nBureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had received an email directly from the\ndefendant from within the MDC claiming to be in fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant\nclaimed to the IG that she feared MDC staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden\nand the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to remove the defendant from general population and\ninvestigate the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate raising such a safety concern would be\nplaced in a single cell of the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) of the MDC. In circumstances where\nthe facility is concerned that the inmate is at heightened risk of <span class=\"highlight\">self-harm</span>, houever, the MDC will\ninstead place the inmate on suicide watch. The Warden and Chief Psychologist indicated that at\nleast two other inmates have recently been placed on suicide watch in similar circumstances.\n\nHere, the Warden and Chief Psychologist assessed that the defendant is at heightened risk\nof <span class=\"highlight\">self-harm</span>, particularly given her upcoming sentencing and sex offender status. As a result, they\nare not comfortable placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also need to remove the defendant\nfrom general population to investigate the threat she reported to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant\nwas placed on suicide watch. Although the defendant has claimed to psychology staff that she is\nnot suicidal, she has refused to answer psychology staff's questions regarding the threat she\nreported to the IG. While she claimed to the IG to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell\npsychology staff what that fear is. Given the defendant’s inconsistent accounts to the IG and to\npsychology staff, the Chief Psychologist assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-\nharm, as it appears she may be atempting to be transferred to a single cell where she can engage\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo73o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document679_ Filed o6/26/22 Page3of4\nin <span class=\"highlight\">self-harm</span>. The defendant will remain on suicide watch until the MDC assesses that she is no\nlonger at heightened risk of <span class=\"highlight\">self-harm</span>. That status will be reevaluated daily. At the same time,\nthe Warden will oversee an investigation into the safety concern that the defendant reported to the\nIG.\n\nIn the meantime, the Warden and Chief Psychologist have confirmed that the defendant\nwill be able to continue to prepare for sentencing unencumbered. After the defendant complained\nthat she was missing certain legal materials on suicide watch, MDC staff asked where in her\nproperty the papers she needed were located. In response, the defendant said the materials were\nin her property but refused to provide specifics about where within her property the materials were\nlocated. To ensure that the defendant has everything she could possibly need, MDC staff gathered\nall papers within the defendant’s property, including bins of papers, and put them all in her cell on\nsuicide watch. As a result, the defendant nou has all of her legal paperwork with her. If she\nbelieves she is missing any items, she can inform MDC staff.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant continues to have access to counsel. The defendant had a legal\nvisit yesterday. The Warden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant will continue to\nbe permited to visit in person with counsel while on suicide watch. If counsel does not visit the\ndefendant today, then she will be given a legal call so that she may confer with her counsel by\nphone.\n\nWith respect to the defendant’s complaints about her conditions more generally, the\nWarden and Chief Psychologist confirmed that the defendant was given clothing this morning and\nis no longer required to wear a smock.

PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU.

Follou-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2ol9. While conducting the lo:oo p.m.\ninstitution count thatevening/\"™ \"i\" ‘| Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-\nmail she sent to Drs Bio | SEE fd Lieutenant\" ater that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as\n\"distraught, sad and a litle confused.\" She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was okay, and he reportedly said he\nwas. Houever, Ms. [Re |noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, \"He seems dazed and\nwithdrawn.\" She went on to say, \"So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from\nPsychology come and talk with him.\" Despite the fact that Lieutenar™”™ pened the e-mail there is no evidence\nthat he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if\nMs. Peo pas concerned about suicide risk, P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,\ncontinuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When[\"\"\"° _|opened the e-mail the follouing Monday morning, Mr.\nEpstein was evaluated by\"°\"\"™ at approximately 9:3o a.m.\nMr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July l8, 2ol9. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these\nconditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. Bi, [or a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\nInstitution Response: 7. Follou Up:\nStaff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant\nwhen they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is\nplaced on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.\n\nAs part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the follouing: “If you are emailing about an inmate\nthat may be at risk for suicide or <span class=\"highlight\">self-harm</span>, this is an emergency situation.
