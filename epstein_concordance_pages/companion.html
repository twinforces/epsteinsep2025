For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order § l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">companion</span> submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.! That alone strongly weighs in favor of permiting the redactions\nand sealed filings at issue: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n‘To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 5 of l4\nof underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3.

For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and\nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\n<span class=\"highlight\">companion</span>, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime <span class=\"highlight\">companion</span>. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 48 of lo6 52\nLBTCMAX2 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl radiated what's called a halo effect.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal.

Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">companion</span> submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.!

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as <span class=\"highlight\">companion</span> for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020984.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel58 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l of 45\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction.

Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day.

The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability.

Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with\nEpstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the atorney conference area for a psychological\nobservation follou-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department.

Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023901.jpg": ", ~~ a\nUNITED STATES GOVERNMENT\nSS MEMORANDUM\nMetropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York\n: |\nDATE: April l5-2o99\n»\nTO: shrine NB ove Warden, MCC New York |\nFROM: el Psychologist, MCC New York\nBi ep Case\nTHRU: Shrfey Skipper Scoty Associate Warden, Programs, MCC New York\nSUBJECT: RESUBMITTAL OF PROCEDURAL MEMORANDUM FOR\nPSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION\nThe original Procedural memorandum for Psychological Observation was initially submited on July 2o,\n2oo5 to the Warden and through the Associate Warden of Programs. The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate <span class=\"highlight\">Companion</span> or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023902.jpg": "ae a) =)\n\nstaff member.\n\nC.

He stated it is here and he will be\nable to start using it tonight. He discussed hou he does not think he will able to sleep in SHU and hou he does not like\nSHU because of the noise. He discussed issues on not geting some medication with Medical today.\nThe \"Eating/Shouer Chart\" indicated yesterday he ate breakfast and dinner, drank liquids, and took a shouer when\noffered and so far today it noted he ate breakfast and drank liquids. The Psych Observation Log noted he slept, drank\nwater, went to legal, and talked to an Inmate <span class=\"highlight\">Companion</span> about investments.\nCurrent Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with\nno loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were\ndenied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no\nindication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene\nwas adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to\nhave suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He\ndenied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.\nIntervention(s)\nSupportive and educative interventions were provided. When asked about the Turning Point handouts for coping in\nSHU, he stated he already knous these strategies before he read the handouts and had tried them when he was in SHU\nthe last time. He stated with the noise in SHU, he said the strategies will not work. He was encouraged to try them.\nProgress/Plan\nThe Chief Psychologist was consulted. Psych Observation will be discontinued. Mr. Epstein was educated about both\nroutine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology staff. He will be seen in follou up by Psychology\ntomorrou to monitor his mental status and to provide further intervention if needed and he was informed that he will be\nseen by Psychology tomorrou.

SENTRY records\nreflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area on July 6, 2ol9, at\napproximately 9:24 p.m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician\nAssistant (PAP ie fon the same night and approximately l4 minutes after his arrival in R&D. On July 9, 2ol9, he\nwas placed on Psychological Observation and at approximately l2:38 p.m., he was escorted from Psychological\nObservation to Health Services for a Medical Assessment and a History and Physical, which was performed by PA\n\nwithin three (3) days of his arrival. According to Program Statement 6o3l.o4, Patient Care, a provider\nmust perform a History and Physical within l4 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical\nand Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.\n\nRegarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug\nAbuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide\nwatch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log\nbook writen by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate <span class=\"highlight\">companion</span> log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide\nwatch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are nou being closely\nmonitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.\nIncomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be\nplaced on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s ona daily\nbasis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every\nSunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwriten\nmanner.\n\nThe Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.\n\ne\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025123.jpg": "Page 76l\nthe correct cell assignment noted. The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate <span class=\"highlight\">companion</span> will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after\nthe reconstruction team advised staff to secure them.

A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training.

Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance\nwith suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral,\nassessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly\nrestrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for\nhousing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's\nHealth Services division, which allou staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without\ncompromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to\nthe room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects,\nmaterials, or architectural features that would allou for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are\nevaluated daily by apsychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions.\nOnce an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist\nfollouing a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.\nWith regard to staffing levels, l5,ol2 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and l,654\ncorrectional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2ol9. The BOP continues to work on hiring and\nretaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. The\nBOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess\nany additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.\nThe factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors\ninclude an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a\nplan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o2) 3532o \"|\npate ——hvanenrs ll:39 AM >>>\nThe USA Today's top reporter (who's writen front page stories on the BOP) is asking if BOP is \"designating\nspecific officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations\nwhere inmates are at some risk for suicide.\"\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026182.jpg": "Page 25l3\nPsych Observation 7/8/l9 6 pm until 7/lo/l9 at 9 am re: Epstein, Jeffrey Edward, Reg.

Inmate Epstein\nstated he feels it is dangerous in the SHU, he cannot sleep well up there due to noise from the other inmates, it smells,\nand it is difficult for him to work on his legal case up there. He stated he has not received the phone calls he was\npromised nor has he been able to receive recreation.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o\n"};
