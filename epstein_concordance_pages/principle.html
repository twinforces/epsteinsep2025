Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a _ two-step\nframework to determine whether a federal statute\napplies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994). Courts look first to\nthe language of the statute. If the statute states that\nit applies to past conduct, courts must so apply it.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute\napplies to past conduct unless doing so would create\nimpermissible retroactive effects. Id.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To\nassess a statute’s meaning here, courts must consider\nthe text of the statute along with other indicia of\ncongressional intent, including the statute’s history\nand structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC,\nSec. Litig. v. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol,\n4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act,\nbroadly states that “[nlo statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping,\nof a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such\nprosecution during the life of the child.” The statute\nlacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this\nparticular statute.

Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v.

Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000337.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 9 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\narmed private guards atempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—trather than the\ndefendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the\ndefendant’s flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s}uch a conclusion would, in fact,\ndemand a defendant's detention’”)).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”\nas “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 (“although this Defendant has vast\nfinancial resources to construct his oun ‘private prison,’ the Court is not convinced ‘disparate\ntreatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act’”) (quoting United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Supp. 2d at l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool) (Nickerson, J.) (“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000341.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l3 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000478.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 _ Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 7 of 33 |\n|\nC.

Legal Principles Governing Release Versus Remand\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42, a Court can order a defendant’s detention\nif it determines that the defendant is either (l) a danger to the community or (2) a risk of flight.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000607.jpg": "JCasenst9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 4o _ Filed o7/26/l9 Page 3 of 6 a\n\nl submissions.

The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule\nl5 of abatement, the judgment of conviction against the deceased\nl6 defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to\nl7 be dismissed. The Wright court held that when a convicted\n\nl8 defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending,\nl9 his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had\n2o during the course of the prosecution.\n2l The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that\n22 when a criminal conviction abates upon the death of a\n23 defendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that\n24 conviction must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with\n25 respect to associated forfeiture orders.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo646\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001162.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n DieGmMehol ooo AFiled 425o8)/26a Ragec?d Gb 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

Simply put, the Court was correct when it determined at\nthe initial bail hearing that France does not appear to extradite its oun citizens. (Tr. 83).\n\nThe defendant’s supposed waiver of her extradition rights with respect to the United\nKingdom should similarly be afforded no weight. Although an anticipatory waiver of extradition\nmay be admissible in extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom, such a waiver is by no means\nbinding, authoritative, or enforceable. See United States v. Stanton, No. 9l Cr. 889 (CHS), l992\nWL 27l3o, at *2 & n.l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, l992) (denying modification of defendant’s bail where\ndefendant indicated willingness to waive extradition proceeding by providing extradition waivers,\nas British authorities advised that extradition waivers were possible only in cases where the\nfugitive actually appeared before a British magistrate after the filing of an extradition request, and\nconcluding that such a waiver was not an “enforceable undertaking”). Under the United\nKingdom’s Extradition Act of 2oo3, consent to extradition is permited, “if (and only if) [a person]\nhas the assistance of counsel or a solicitor to represent him in the proceedings before the\nappropriate judge.” Extradition Act 2oo3, § l27(9), htps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/\n2oo3/4l.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’).

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J.

This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001269.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/oo8BQlAU At DOMED l/2o 2 Filedees/2G/PIagPage 45l65l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v.

Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v.

Houever, the existing Extradition Treaty between France and the USA of 23\nApril l996 does not contain such prohibition. As a result, the extradition of a French\nnational to the USA is legally permissible under French law.\n\ne Jn order to assure the US authorities that she will not atempt to contest her extradition\nas a French citizen or otherwise, we are informed that Ms Maxwell is about to execute\nan irrevocable waiver of her right to seek the protection of the French Courts to fight\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002127.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nany extradition request from the US Government to the competent French Authorities\n(“The Waiver’). (See Exhibit B).\n\ne All extradition requests from the USA to France must be examined by the Investigating\nChamber of the competent Court of appeal, which has jurisdiction over the legality of\nextradition requests in France.\n\ne Under the circumstances of this case, where Ms Maxwell would have fled from the USA\nto France prior to her trial in violation of her bail conditions, it is highly likely that Ms\nMaxwell would be placed in custody in France from the earliest stages of the extradition\nproceedings.\n\ne As the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> against the extradition of nationals is not part of the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber of the Court of appeal would\nnot oppose the extradition of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on the ground that she is a French\ncitizen.\n\ne The final decision to extradite and its execution would ultimately be a mater for the\nexecutive.\n\ne Inthe recent past, J am not aware that the French authorities would have had to address\nthe situation in which the United States sought extradition of a French citizen who was\nalso a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it\nis highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors, namely: her\nUnited States citizenship; the fact that she has signed an irrevocable Waiver in the USA;\nthe fact that in the present situation, the only way the issue would be raised in France is\nif Ms. Maxwell would have already fled to France in violation of very strict bail\nconditions, and the fact that a failure by French authorities to grant extradition would\nresult in an obligation to try Ms. Maxwell before French courts for the conduct described\nin the Indictment. Finally, France would be inclined to preserving the interests of the\nUSA for obvious diplomatic reasons.\n\ne With regard to timing, if the requested person has consented to extradition, the\nInvestigating Chamber must deliver its ruling no later than l4 working days after the\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 6 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nBackground\n\nl. Athe bail hearing of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on l4 July 2o2o, the US Government made\n\nthe follouing point in support of its motion to detain the defendant:\n“The government has spoken with the Department of Justice ataches in the\nUnited Kingdom and France. With respect to France, we have been informed\nthat France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States.””.\n\n2. The international ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French nationality appear as one\nof the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\n“Ms Maxwell’s history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of\nflight. Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States. She holds multiple foreign citizenships, has familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant\nvalue. In particular, she is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to\nextradite its citizens”.\n\n3. The present report intends to evaluate whether the contention that France is a nation that\ndoes not extradite its citizens is correct as a mater of law.\n\n4. It will first set out the various steps of the French extradition procedure (Part I, and\nthen outline the grounds on which extradition requests are analyzed under French law,\nand especially the status of the rule against extradition of nationals, in order to assess the\napplication of these principles to an extradition request made by the USA, in particular\nwhere, as in this case, the requested person has executed an irrevocable waiver of his/her\nright to contest extradition and is present in France only because she fled the United\nStates in violation of her bail conditions.

This\nphase varies depending on whether the requested person consents to extradition.\n\nl9. If the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General that he or she consents to\nextradition, Article 696-l3 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides that he\nor she must appear before the Investigating Chamber within 5 working days from the\ndate of presentation before the Prosecutor General. The same provision states that the\nrequested person may also decide to waive the rule of specialty before the Prosecutor\nGeneral.\n\n2o. If, at this appearance, the requested person confirms his or her consent to be extradited\nand the legal conditions for extradition are fulfilled, the Investigating Chamber informs\nthe person of the legal consequences of such consent and formally acknouledges this\nconsent within 7 days from the date of appearance, unless additional investigations have\nbeen ordered’,\n\n2l. The rules of this simplified extradition procedure must be read in light of Article ll of\nthe Agreement on Extradition between the European Union and the USA of 25 June\n2oo3 (“Simplified extradition procedures”), which states that “if the person sought\nconsents to be surrendered to the requesting State, the requested State may, in\naccordance with the principles and procedures provided for under its legal system,\nsurrender the person as expeditiously as possible without further proceedings. The\nconsent of the person sought may include agreement to waiver of protection of the rule\nof specialty”!°.

The wording of these international agreements, which do not contain a prohibition on\nthe extradition of nationals, raises some important questions. In particular, could France\ndecide to extradite its nationals on the basis of these international agreements without\nviolating applicable international law, European law, or French constitutional law?\n\n64. In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus necessary to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) applicable international law, (i) European law, and (i) French\nconstitutional law.\n\n7) International law\n\n65. As outlined, international treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> constitutional status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under international\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European Convention on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n69. Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\n<span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 22 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n73. The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 2o of 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

Indeed, the Government is unaware of any instance in which France has ever extradited\na French citizen to the United States. (See Ex. B at 4 (“[T]he <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of non-extradition of\nnationals is a <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of extradition law from which France has never deviated outside the\nframework of the European Union.”’)). Simply put, the Court was correct when it determined at\nthe initial bail hearing that France does not appear to extradite its oun citizens. (Tr. 83).\n\nThe defendant’s supposed waiver of her extradition rights with respect to the United\nKingdom should similarly be afforded no weight. Although an anticipatory waiver of extradition\nmay be admissible in extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom, such a waiver is by no means\nbinding, authoritative, or enforceable. See United States v. Stanton, No. 9l Cr. 889 (CHS), l992\nWL 27l3o, at *2 & n.l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, l992) (denying modification of defendant’s bail where\ndefendant indicated willingness to waive extradition proceeding by providing extradition waivers,\nas British authorities advised that extradition waivers were possible only in cases where the\nfugitive actually appeared before a British magistrate after the filing of an extradition request, and\nconcluding that such a waiver was not an “enforceable undertaking”). Under the United\nKingdom’s Extradition Act of 2oo3, consent to extradition is permited, “if (and only if) [a person]\nhas the assistance of counsel or a solicitor to represent him in the proceedings before the\nappropriate judge.” Extradition Act 2oo3, § l27(9), htps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/\n2oo3/4l.

This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law.

For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case.

The only difference between the two counts is the purported crime\nunderlying the § 37l conspiracy charged.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 22\ndecision in Martindell v.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 38\ndiscovery demonstrates that\nee ae\n[|\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to obtain a global\nresolution that would, among other things, provide maximum protection for any alleged co-\nconspirators, in significant part to minimize the likelihood that Epstein could be subpoenaed as a\npotential witness and have to testify under oath.

The Government is required to observe high\nstandards of integrity and honorable conduct, and the supervisory pouer of the court is designed\nto insure that such standards are observed.”). Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental constitutional rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\nperformance.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53). Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government.

Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

Even if there\nwere ambiguity, which there is not, that ambiguity must be construed against the government and\nin favor of the defense. Accordingly, the indictment must be dismissed.

Here, the NPA unambiguously precludes prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators, and the indictment in this case must be dismissed.\n\nIn support of its July 2o2o motion for Ms. Maxwell’s detention, the government raised\nthree arguments why it contends the NPA does not bar Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution: (l) that Ms.\nMaxwell supposedly lacks standing to enforce the NPA; (i) that the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision applies only in the SDFL; and (i) that the provision is limited to conduct occurring\nduring the 2ool-o7 time period and to violations of statutes specifically referenced in the NPA.\nGovernment’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Reply Mem.”), Dkt.

In E/-Sadig, the court held\nthat the defendant, who was alleged to have purchased firearms unlawfully for two members of\nthe Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to\nenforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to prosecute any of the\nindividuals involved in the purchase. l33 F.

The court concluded that “even if\nthe non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can\nenforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 6o8. Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement. Jd. at 6o9.\n\nBoth Florida West and El-Sadig illustrate hou the government’s argument that Ms.\nMaxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA is contrary to bedrock principles of contract law, as\napplied to immunity agreements. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants in Florida West and El-\nSadig were not parties to the agreements at issue. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants were not\nspecifically named in the agreements. Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were\nthird-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the\nagreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity.

Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 32 of 38\nAtorney’s Office.” NPA at 2. The later investigation, in turn, encompasses not only “offenses”\nfrom the 2ool-o7 time period, but also “Epstein’s background.” /d. at l. Thus, for example,\nprosecution of Epstein for a pre-2ool offense that arose out of the FBI/USAO investigation into\nEpstein’s background, or for an unlisted statutory offense that arose from the grand jury\ninvestigation, would have been prohibited under the NPA.\n\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision does not include even those broad limitations. It\nprovides, simply, that the United States will not “institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Jd. at 5 (emphasis added). The provision could not be\nclearer, either on its face or in the context of the NPA as a whole. As with the absence of\nlanguage limiting the provision to prosecution in the SDFL, the absence of any language limiting\nthe offenses for which potential co-conspirators cannot be prosecuted, when such language is\nincluded as to Epstein, must be presumed under contract interpretation principles to have been\nintentional. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank, 424 F.3d at 2o6; Port Consol., 826 F. App’x at 827-28. At\nminimum, the silence as to time period and covered conduct is an ambiguity and therefore should\nbe resolved against the government. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 269.\n\nEven if the NPA were construed as placing some limitation on co-conspirator immunity,\nno rational limitation could exclude the conduct alleged here. The charges against Ms. Maxwell\ninvolve her alleged role as a co-conspirator of Epstein, involving alleged conduct almost\nidentical to the alleged conduct that led up to the NPA. Indeed, the United States Atorney for\nthis District, in announcing the current indictment, described it as “the prequel to the earlier case\nwe brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and\nFitzpatrick, S. “Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.”\nNBC New York.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 25\n\nNo statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\n\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall\n\npreclude such prosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.\n\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). Thus, if an individual commited an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse of a l6-year-old person on June l, l994, and the victim reached age l7 on July l,\nl994, then the statute of limitations as to that offense would have expired on July l, 2oo2, when\nthe victim reached age 25—-such that an indictment in 2o2o would be time-barred. There is no\ndispute that all three of the accusers here turned 25 long ago, and thus the statute of limitations in\neffect at the time of the offenses has expired.\n\nIn 2oo3, houever, Congress amended the statute and extended the time in which a\nprosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim.

While the government would apply the 2oo3 Amendment retroactively\nto offenses Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited years earlier, nothing in the text suggests\nthat the statute may be applied retroactively.\n\nTo the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed a strong “presumption against\nretroactive legislation” that is “deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.” Landgraf v.

Georgetoun Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 2o4, 2o8 (l988). This presumption\nagainst retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal\ncontext. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie v. United States, 397 U.S. ll2, ll5 (l97o) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.\n5l8, 522 (l932)). This <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:\n“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain\nfixed period of time follouing the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish\nby criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll4. “Such a limitation is designed to protect\nindividuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have\nbecome obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment\nbecause of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at ll4-l5.\n\nIn Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the\nproposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:\n\n[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed\n\nthe statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to\n\nresort to judicial default rules. When, houever, the statute contains no such\n\nexpress command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have\n\nretroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with\n\nrespect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate\n\nretroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent\n\nclear congressional intent favoring such a result.\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or\nwill not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to\ndetermine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”\nId.\n\nAs shoun belou, retroactive application of the 2oo3 Amendment fails both steps of the\nLandgraf analysis.

Jd. at 58.°\n\nCongressional intent here could not be clearer. The House bill would have made the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive, the Senate bill did not, and the conference consciously rejected the\nretroactivity provision. It is unnecessary to proceed to the second Landgraf step, and Counts\nOne through Four are time-barred.\n\nB. Step Two: Application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\n\noffenses would have impermissible effects.\n\nIf the Court were to proceed to the second Landgraf step—whether application of the\n2oo3 Amendment here would have an impermissible retroactive effect—that step also counsels\nagainst retroactivity.\n\nAny analysis of the retroactivity of a criminal statute of limitations under the second step\nof Landgraf must be undertaken in conjunction with the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that unlike civil statutes of\nlimitation, “criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). As one court recognized in\ndeclining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and\nToussie “are read in conjunction,” courts “must interpret the statute of limitations in a manner\nfavoring repose for Defendant.” United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.\n2ol7).\n\n* Nor was this clear evidence of congressional intent raised or considered in United States v. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (S.D.N.Y.

The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l _ Filed o3/23/2l Page l5 of l8\n\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

A plea agreement\n\nbinds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in\n\nwhich the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\n\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (citations omited). Thus, under Annabi and its progeny, a plea agreement\nonly binds the U.S. Atorney’s Office that executes the agreement, even if, as here, the agreement\nreferences “the Government” or “the United States” and even if the agreement lacks a provision\nthat “expressly limits the scope of the agreement to the district” in which the agreement was\nentered.”\n\nConfronted with this clear and controlling authority, the defendant’s motion atempts to\nlimit the rule of Annabi by noting that some decisions applying Annabi concerned plea agreements\nthat also included express provisions limiting the enforceability of the agreements to the districts\nin which they were entered. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Essentially, the defendant argues that without an\nexpress provision limiting the scope of the agreement, every plea agreement should be interpreted\nto bind the entire federal government. But the law in this Circuit holds the opposite: the\npresumption is that a plea agreement in one district does not bind another, absent an affirmative\nappearance that the agreement extends more broadly. See Laskou, 688 F.

(Def. Mot. l. at l3). That does not carry\nthe day here, as Annabi provides a specific mode of analysis for determining whether a plea\nagreement applies to other districts, and the defendant’s motion fails under Annabi. More broadly,\nthe authorities the defendant cites for this general <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> arise from circumstances in which a\ndefendant has sought to enforce his oun a plea agreement against the Government. (See, e.g., Def.\nMot. l at l3 (citing United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (analyzing claim\nby defendant seeking to enforce promises he claimed prosecutors had made to him)). Notably, the\ndefendant has cited no authority for the proposition that plea agreements are to be construed in\nfavor of a third party who was not involved in plea negotiations.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4l of 239\n\nincluding any agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind\n\nany other district(s) or division without the express writen approval\n\nof the United States Atorney(s) in each affected district and/or the\n\nAssistant Atorney General of the Criminal Division.’\nGovernment Brief, o8 Civ. 8o736 (KAM), Dkt.

Significantly,\nthis brief was signed by the same prosecutor who negotiated and signed the NPA. /d. Although\nthe defendant makes the sweeping, self-serving, and unsupported allegation that “the government\nhad every reason to foresee a potential prosecution of Epstein’s co-conspirators in this District\nand, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice, intended to agree to preclude\nit,’ the USAO-SDFL’s brief says otherwise. (Def. Mot. l at 22). Further still, the record\ndeveloped in both civil litigation and OPR’s investigation does not support this claim.\n\n3s 2 3\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant has failed to produce any evidence that the\nUSAO-SDFL promised Epstein that other districts would be bound by the NPA. There is no\n“affirmative appearance” that the NPA binds other districts, and the motion should be denied.\nUnder Annabi and its progeny, the defendant has failed to establish that the NPA binds other\ndistricts. For this reason alone, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed, in keeping with the\nwell-established law in this Circuit.*\n8 In her motion, the defendant asks this Court to apply a bizarre and unprecedented choice-of-\nfederal-law doctrine, under which the defendant asks the Court to apply non-existent rulings from\nthe Eleventh Circuit on an issue that Court does not appear to have reached. (Def. Mot. l at 23-\n25). This argument has no legal foundation, and the defendant offers no authority for the\nproposition that federal plea agreements are governed by the choice of law principles that apply to\nconflicting state laws. Annabi is the binding law of this Circuit, and this Court must apply it.\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 239\nGovernment’s promises in the plea agreement to only cover past crimes, observing that “not\nlimiting the prohibition to past crimes would make it absurd and probably illegal”) (citing Aronson\nv. K. Arakelian, Inc., l54 F.2d 23l, 233 (7th Cir. l946) (“[A] contract will not be presumed to\nhave imposed an absurd or impossible condition on one of the parties, but will be interpreted as\nthe parties must be supposed to have understood the conditions at the time.”)).\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the NPA covers all violations of the Mann Act. (Def.\nMot. | at 26 n.4). Not so. The NPA lists specific statutory provisions within the Mann Act, but\nnone of the provisions contained in the Indictment. In particular, the NPA expressly covers\nviolations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), and 2423(e), but it does not include the particular\nprovisions charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, which alleges violations of §§ 2422(a) and\n2423(a). These are plainly not the same crimes, and a plea agreement cannot be read to immunize\nunnamed crimes in the general ballpark of the specific crimes enumerated in the agreement. The\ndefendant cites no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.\n\nAccordingly, the NPA immunizes only certain, specific offenses, none of which are\ncontained in the Indictment. As a result, the defendant cannot invoke the NPA to seek the dismissal\nof the Indictment.\n\n2. The NPA Does Not Confer Enforceable Rights on Maxwell\n\nEven if this Court were to construe the NPA beyond its plain terms to preclude prosecutions\nfor the crimes contained in the Indictment, the defendant has established neither that those\nprotections extend to Maxwell specifically, nor that she has standing to pursue those protections.\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to interpret the NPA according to contract principles, and\naccord the defendant standing to enforce the NPA as a third party beneficiary. As a general mater,\nplea agreements are interpreted using principles from contract law, but that maxim is not without\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2978\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 239\nlimitations. As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea\nagreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. l at 3o (citing\nUnited States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (“[W]hile the district court’s analysis\nmight have been compelling with respect to a contract arising out of commercial negotiations\namong private parties, we believe the court did not correctly apply the standards that govern the\ninterpretation of plea agreements with the government. We have long recognized that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l3, l998) (“Even if Santobello could\nestablish the existence of plea agreements between the Government and his co-defendants, there\nis litle knoun authority that would allou him to enforce the agreements as a third party\nbeneficiary.”) (citing United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (lst Cir. l99l)).\n\nFollouing this logic, at least one court has concluded that third parties lack standing to\nenforce plea agreements. In United States v. Mariamma Viju, the defendant claimed that the\nGovernment had entered into a plea agreement with her husband, under which the Government\nhad promised not to prosecute her. No. l5 Cr. 24o, 2ol6 WL lo784l, at *l (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll,\n2ol6). Observing that the principles governing interpretation of plea agreements diverge in many\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2979\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 46 of 239\nrespects from those underlying contract law, the district court concluded that “third-party\nbeneficiaries have no contractual right to enforce plea agreements.” Jd. at *3-4. The court\nreasoned, “[t]he right to enforce a plea deal does not exist for its oun sake; rather, it is a means to\nachieve fairness in plea bargaining.” /d. at *4. That is because a defendant has the right to enforce\nhis plea agreement, and “enforcement by third parties adds nothing to protecting the defendant’s\nright.” Jd. The same holds true here.\n\nIn support of her claim that she has standing to enforce the NPA, the defendant relies upon\nthree district court decisions, none of which analyzed the threshold question of whether third party\nstanding concepts from contract law apply to plea agreements. In United States v. Florida West\nInt’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9, l228 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the district court applied the third\nparty beneficiary doctrine to a former airline employee based on a prior plea agreement with the\nairline that immunized, among others, current and former employees of the airline and its\nsubsidiaries. In its analysis, houever, the court applied the doctrine without analyzing the question\nof whether third party beneficiary standing principles apply to plea agreements. /d. For similar\nreasons, the defendant’s reliance on United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo, 6o8-o9 (N.D.\nOhio 2ool) is misplaced. In that case, the court permited a third party to invoke a plea agreement,\nbut it did not analyze or address whether third party standing rules apply to plea agreements. /d.\nLikewise, in United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3 (D.S.C. l984), the court\napplied the third party beneficiary doctrine, but relied solely on contracts treatises for support, and\ndid not analyze whether that doctrine should be applied to plea agreements.\n\nIn any event, even if third party beneficiaries had standing to enforce federal plea\nagreements, the defendant has failed to establish that she is a third party beneficiary of the NPA.\nIn order to establish that she has enforceable rights under the NPA, the defendant must shou that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003009.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 239\ncrimes or events.

Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’!

The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights.

For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-conviction appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\nindication that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the exception, not the\nrule.” United States v.

Similarly, “[c]ourts have repeatedly recognized the appropriateness\nof trying perjury or obstruction charges together with the underlying crimes to which the perjury\nrelates, where proof of the alleged perjury requires proof of knouledge of the underlying crime.”\nUnited States v.

R. Crim. P. l4(a). “[I]n order to prevail” on a Rule l4 motion,\n“the defendant must shou not simply some prejudice but substantial prejudice.” United States v.\nSampson, 385 F.3d l83, l9o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Werner, 62o F.2d at 928). The defendant\ncarries this “heavy burden” because Rule 8(a) already strikes a “balance” between “considerations\nof economy and speed” and “possible unfairness” to the defendant. United States v. Amato, l5\nF.3d 23o, 237 (2d Cir. l994). Accordingly, “the principles that guide the district court’s\nconsideration of a motion for severance usually counsel denial,” Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at\n*5 (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citation omited), and severance should be granted\n“only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the\ndefendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence,” Zafiro\nv.

The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 348\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances.

USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate.

The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the applicable definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). But even under such an expansive\ndefinition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nSection 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a child, let alone the\n“employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to engage in any\nsex-related conduct.

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts.

There is no question that they did. The Court thus\nconcludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the\nPROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to\nher alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in\nWeingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the\nview Maxwell nou takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions\nof at least two other circuit courts.

In this case, houever, (l) the\ngovernment violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.\n\nSuppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is\ngrounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right\nto due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,\n594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex.

But Maxwell had no idea that\nthe Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the\ngovernment disclosed the 9o,ooo pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The\ngovernment’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (suppression for due process violation).\n\nSecond, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice\nand an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,\n\n* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet’s\npassing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be\nunsealed—apparently does not knou the Protective Order was modified.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page5of23\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nDismiss the Superseding Indictment for Breach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement (“Motion”).\n\nAs though it were wielding an invisible ink pen, the government adds language to its\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein that does not exist in the text, and\nthen pretends no one can see the clear, unambiguous language that does appear there. The plain\nlanguage of the NPA states, without limitation, that “the United States .. . will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Because the Superseding\nIndictment (“Indictment”) contends that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, the NPA,\non its face, applies here. Thus, the government’s only argument, which it makes throughout its\nopposition, is that the NPA means something other than what it says.\n\nIn suggesting that the parties to the NPA intended to immunize only the four individuals\nspecifically named in the co-conspirator immunity provision, the government flagrantly ignores\nthe express statement that immunity is “not limited to” those individuals. In arguing that the\nprovision binds only the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida\n(“USAO-SDFL”), the government asks the Court to add the words “in this District” to that\nprovision, on the thin suggestion that the parties must have meant to include the same limitation\non location of prosecution that they included in Epstein’s immunity provision, even though they\nfailed to do so. And for good measure, the government asks the Court to find that the parties\nmust have intended to limit co-conspirator immunity to specific statutory offenses commited\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7, even though—again—no such limitation appears in the text of the co-\nconspirator immunity provision.\n\nNotwithstanding the bedrock <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that plea agreements are construed strictly against\nthe government, the government asks the Court to simply assume that the parties intended the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof23\n\nIn sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a “potential co-conspirator of\nEpstein,” and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nI. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4.

Requests l, 2, and 8 all seek documents\nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests l and 2 seek\ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2ol5\nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that\nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government’s failure to comply with its\ndiscovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be\notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the\nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government\nhas not met its discovery obligations, the Rule l7(c) subpoena process is not the proper\nmechanism for pursuing that.

Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 47 of 349\n4. Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 93 of 349\ngoing to become a registered sex offender, and he was going to go actually do time—which he\nhadn’t done up to this point.” Krischer asked, “Why would I turn that doun?” Krischer also noted\nthat at that time, sexual offender registration “was not the norm” in Florida, and he recognized that\n“it was clearly something that was important to the U.S. Atorney’s Office.” !\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not recall if he learned what transpired at the September l2\nmeeting, nor did he recall why the USAO team agreed to permit Epstein to plead guilty to only\none charge. Acosta told OPR, houever, that he recognized that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lol of 349\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.

Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 296 of 349\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 7 of 26\ndistrict bringing the second prosecution charges offenses different from the offenses resolved by\nthe plea agreement in the first prosecution.” (Def.

Annabi contains no such exception, and the Government is not aware of any\ncourt in this Circuit to apply such a rule.\n\nIn Annabi, the Second Circuit articulated a universal <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> for interpreting whether a\nplea agreement is binding outside the district where it was executed. Annabi explained that,\nalthough it “might be thought” that a U.S. Atorney’s Office’s agreement which provided that “‘the\nGovernment’ will dismiss counts of an indictment” would bind the United States in every judicial\ndistrict, “the law has evolved to the contrary.” 77l F.2d at 672. Relying on several of its\nprecedents, the Court explained that the default rule in this Circuit is that plea agreements bind\nonly the district involved, absent an affirmative appearance to the contrary. /d. In particular, the\nSecond Circuit relied on its opinions in United States v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d lo65, lo72 (2d Cir.\nl985), and United States v. Alessi, 544 F.2d ll39, ll54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 96o\n(l976). Nothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same\noffenses that were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be\ncovered by the plea agreement. The holding of Annabi is clear and straightforward, and this Court\nhas already concluded that, under Annabi, there is no affirmative appearance that the NPA binds\nentities aside from the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe defendant nou claims that when the Government brings charges that are similar to\nthose contained in a plea agreement, Annabi is silent, and that the Court is therefore free to apply\nthe opposite presumption, namely, that the plea agreement is universally binding on the\nGovernment. The defendant’s argument rests exclusively on the phrase “identical to the dismissed\ncharges,” which appears in a paragraph in Annabi. (Def. Mot. at ll).

In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard.

To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool).

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 54 of 8o\n\nto prosecute a case”); Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate\n\ndiscretion to file criminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\nClancy, l92 A.3d at 53 (cleaned up).\n\nAs prosecutors are vested with such “tremendous” discretion and authority, our\nlaw has long recognized the special weight that must be accorded to their assurances.\nFor instance, in the context of statements made during guilty plea negotiations, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has held that, as a mater of constitutional due\nprocess and as compelled by the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of fundamental fairness, a defendant generally\nis entitled to the benefit of assurances made by the prosecutor. See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43. The prosecutor also agreed to consent to a\nrequest that Zuber’s sentence be served concurrently with “back time” that Zuber was\nrequired to serve for a parole violation. /d. at443. The prosecutor stated the terms of the\nagreement on the record, and the trial court accepted the terms of Zuber’s guilty plea and\nol In Santobello, the Supreme Court of the United States did not state explicitly that\nit was premising its holding on due process guarantees. Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a constitutional basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater. See Santobello, 4o4\nU.S., at 266-67 (Douglas, J. concurring).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5/7 of 8o\nPennsylvania State Police that he or she was subject to the intervening statute and thus\nhad to comply with the new obligations under SORNA, even though those obligations\ncontradicted the terms of each of their plea deals. /d. at 522-523.\n\nEach of the three offenders filed an action seeking the enforcement of the terms\nof his guilty plea, notwithstanding the fact that those terms conflicted with the newly-\nenacted statute. /d. at 523-24.

For instance, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit has explained that, like plea agreements, non-prosecution agreements are\nbinding contracts that must be interpreted according to general principles of contract law,\nguided by “special due process concerns.” United States v. Baird, 2l8 F.3d 22l, 229 (3d\nCir. 2ooo) (citation omited). And, in Commonwealth v. Ginn, 587 A.2d 3l4 (Pa.

Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request. The Circuit Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that, because the agreement was not formalized and accepted by the\ncourt, the defendant was not entitled to specific performance under a contract law theory.\nId. at 362. The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the\nprosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his\nright to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, houever, that, by contrast, when a\n“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this\ninduced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24\n\nConsidered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their\nword, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full\nunderstanding of the circumstances, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of\none or more constitutional rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or\ndecisions under principles of contract law or by application of the fundamental fairness\nconsiderations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 59 of 8o\n\nThere is no doubt that promises made during plea negotiations or as part of fully\nconsummated plea agreements differ in kind from the unilateral discretion exercised when\na prosecutor declines to pursue criminal charges against a defendant. As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights.

Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 73 of 8o\ndo just that, D.A. Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv. Mebane, 58 A.3d l243 (Pa. Super. 2ol2) (upholding trial court ruling that fundamental\n28 See Khan v. State Bd. of Auctioneer Exam'rs, 842 A.2d 936, 946 (Pa. 2oo4)\n(“Substantive due process is the esoteric concept interwoven within our judicial\nframework to guarantee fundamental fairness and substantial justice . . . .”) (cleaned up).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 74 of 8o\nfairness required enforcement of the prosecution’s plea offer that was later withdrawn,\nwhere the defendant detrimentally relied upon the offer); Commonwealth v. McSorley,\n485 A.2d l5, 2o (Pa. Super. l984), aff'd, 5o6 A.2d 895 (Pa. l986) (per curiam) (enforcing\nan incomplete agreement based upon detrimental reliance). As noted earlier, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement. In that case, Stipetich agreed with the police that, if he revealed\nhis source for obtaining drugs, no charges would be filed against him or his wife.\nStipetich, 652 A.2d at l294-95. Even though Stipetich fulfilled his end of the bargain,\ncharges still were filed against him and his wife. /d. at l295.

In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 8o of 8o\nCommonwealth v. DiPasquale, 246 A.2d 43o, 432 (Pa. l968)). The decision to charge,\nor not to charge, a defendant can be conditioned, modified, or revoked at the discretion\nof the prosecutor.\n\nHouever, the discretion vested in our Commonwealth’s prosecutors, houever\nvast, does not mean that its exercise is free of the constraints of due process. When an\nunconditional charging decision is made publicly and with the intent to induce action and\nreliance by the defendant, and when the defendant does so to his detriment (and in some\ninstances upon the advice of counsel), denying the defendant the benefit of that decision\nis an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution\nthat was foregone for more than a decade. No mere changing of the guard strips that\ncircumstance of its inequity. See, e.g., State v. Myers, 5l3 S.E.2d 676, 682 n.l (W.Va.\nl998) (explaining that “any change in the duly elected prosecutor does not affect the\nstandard of responsibility for the office”). A contrary result would be patently untenable.\nIt would violate long-cherished principles of fundamental fairness. It would be antithetical\nto, and corrosive of, the integrity and functionality of the criminal justice system that we\nstrive to maintain.\n\nFor these reasons, Cosby’s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated,\nand he is discharged.*°\n\nJustices Todd, Donohue and Mundy join the opinion.\n\nJustice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which\nChief Justice Baer joins.\n\nJustice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.\na5 Accordingly, we do not address Cosby’s other issue.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l Page3of7\nPage 3\n\nlawyers was making outrageously false statements to the press.2 The prosecution\nresponded: “Spencer Kuvin does not represent any of the witnesses the Government\nexpects to call at trial in this case.

No confidential\ninformation was disclosed.2 Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument\nin a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 3lo). In that public\npleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was\n\nenforceable and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later\n\non the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a\n\nresult, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,\n\nthe Court noted the follouing:\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant,\nincluding circumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some\npromise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the\ndictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the\n\ngovernment is trying to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms.\n\nMaxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she\n\nwas granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> applies even\n\nmore strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal\n2 Emma Parry, Will She Survive?, (May 6, 2o2l),\n\nhtps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/l4875477/ghislaine-maxwell-plea-deal-same-fate-as-\nepstein/\n3 See Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo74 (explaining that the risk of influencing a potential jury\nexists for trial lawyer because they “have special access to information through\ndiscovery and client communications” that others do not have).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l  Page4of7\nPage 4\n\nwriten agreement, as opposed to an informal promise like the one in Cosby.\n\nThis is not consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.\n(emphasis added).\n\nThe press (including Bloomberg, NBC, the New York Post, and Forbes)‘ reported\non this argument by Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers. Accordingly, there is no substantial\nlikelihood that the Op-Ed, which made the very same arguments that were made by\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers and covered extensively in the press, will interfere with a fair\ntrial, and the Government does not even really atempt to argue to the contrary.®\n\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell’s family, and undersigned as counsel for her family, have\nthe right to respond to the numerous lawyers, witnesses, and surrogates who are\nspeaking to the press and making it impossible for Ms. Maxwell to receive a fair trial.\nAs Justice Kennedy explained in Gentile, “in some circumstances press comment is\nnecessary to protect the rights of the client and prevent abuse.” Such “statements have\nthe full protection of the First Amendment.” Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo58 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring).\n\nThe press has been unrelenting and overwhelmingly prejudicial in its coverage\nof Ms. Maxwell and her family, fueled by statements from involved parties about the\nmaters at issue. It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage\nis pro-government and anti-Maxwell. The press has already tried and convicted her.\nAnd the Government has done nothing to control its surrogates, which has only made\nthe problem worse.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead.

The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 54\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence contain extensive provisions governing the impeachment of\nwitnesses.

Carton, No. l7 Cr. 68o (CM),\n2ol8 WL 58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charged crimes. See United States v. Duncan,\nNo. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v.

See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v.

The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others.

Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law enforcement officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law enforcement witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed.

United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the foundation requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\nenforcement agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves in limine to preclude reference to the accusers as “victims” or\n“minor victims.” Ms. Maxwell moves for an order precluding all trial participants from referring\nto the accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” Instead, all trial participants, including the\nCourt, should refer to all persons by their individual names.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent unless the\ngovernment proves all elements of the alleged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page6 of 84\ntraumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it\noccurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is\nalso expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure,\nand secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety\nof reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive\nevents is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page /7 of 84\n\n579, 588 (l993) (quoting Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. l53, l69 (l988)).\n\nUnder Daubert, a district court must first determine whether an expert is qualified. See\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2 (“A witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience,\ntraining, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise .. . .”); United States v.\nKidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“At the first step of the Daubert inquiry, courts\nare instructed to consider the expert’s qualifications.”). Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat’l RR.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). “[T]hese criteria,” houever, “are not\nexhaustive.” Jd. Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94). And “there are many different kinds of experts, and many different kinds of expertise.”\nKumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l5o (l999). “[W]hether the specific expert\ntestimony focuses upon specialized observations, the specialized translation of those\nobservations into theory, a specialized theory itself, or the application of such a theory in a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo579o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it. But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.

This psychological dynamic between a victim of child sexual abuse and her abusers is\n“beyond the knouledge of the average juror and would or could plainly be helpful in understanding\nthe psychological dynamics at play.” Oct. l7, 2ol9 Tr. at 27:3-7, United States v.

Jurors are not apt to intuitively\nunderstand the mechanisms that may lead a woman who is not physically restrained or confined\nto heed the demands of a pimp to traffic herself.”). Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def. Mot. at lo).\n* Relying again on Raymond, the District of Maine case, the defendant argues that expert testimony\nabout “general principles is helpful only when it ‘describes widely recognized and highly\npredictable and verifiable phenomena.’” (Def. Mot. lo (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o\nn.l2 (alterations omited)). That proposition comes from footnote l2 of Raymond, which\natempted to distinguish that expert’s “profile” testimony from the Federal Rules Advisory\nCommitee’s observation that the 2ooo amendment “does not alter the venerable practice of using\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 84\n\nThat is precisely hou Rule 7o2 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which\nthe Rule contemplates. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note (“[I]t might also be\nimportant in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles, without\never atempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.”). Dr. Rocchio will\nprovide reliable opinions about principles of coercion and atachment in abusive relationships that\nwill help the jury understand the psychological factors underlying the relationships that the jury\nwill learn about at trial.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the Court should preclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony under\nRule 4o3. In so arguing, she expresses concern that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will “‘radically\nsimplify’ an otherwise complex case” by “‘foist[ing] a damning teleology on a series of actions\neach of which might have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all.’” (Def. Mot. at\nll (quoting United States v. Burns, No. o7 Cr. 556, 2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27,\n2oo9)).° There is nothing prejudicial or simple about Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. The jury will not\nconclude that the defendant is guilty because Dr. Rocchio explains that acts which “might have\nbeen motivated by a variety of ends” are sometimes part of the process of sexual abuse. Whether\nexpert testimony to educate the factfinder on general principles.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl5o n.l2 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note). The defendant cites no place\ncontaining this limitation in the text of the Rule, its advisory commitee notes, Daubert, or the law\nof this Circuit or District. Nor does it make sense on its oun terms: “hou financial markets respond\nto corporate reports” or the “principles of thermodynamics” are sometimes highly predictable, but\nnot always, depending on the context.\n> Burns, a case about a district court’s application at sentencing of a Guidelines enhancement, says\nnothing about whether the jury would be confused by learning about grooming.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6o of 84\n\nThe defense errs when it suggests that the Court ordered the Government to specifically\nitemize any co-conspirator statements contained in its disclosures. When the Court first set a\ndisclosure schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which\nopposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness\nstatements. (Order at l, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the\nidentities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator\nstatements, citing the Court’s earlier order. (Order at 2, Dkt. No. 335). Neither order expressly\ndirected the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial\nseparately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.\n\nA requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,\nthe Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.\n(Op. & Order at 3o-3l, Dkt. No. 2o7). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on\nthis issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the\nGovernment to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the\nconvenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an\norder would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For\na third, the guiding <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation\nof those statements’ admissibility pre-trial. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such\nstatements can be conditionally admited during the trial, and their admissibility litigated\nthereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 26o, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969)); Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings.

Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 52\nas well as [her] experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of\npeople who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.” Mot. Ex. l, p 2.\n\ne The government tries to disclaim the importance of error rates. Resp. at l5-l7.\nBut it’s not just that Rocchio cannot identify an error rate, it’s that her implicit\nconclusion is that she doesn’t have an error rate. That is, all her patients are\ntelling the truth when they say they were groomed, so any evidence that matches\nwhat her patients have told her is therefore evidence of grooming.\n\ne But even if the error-rate discussion were misplaced, that doesn’t mean Rocchio’s\nopinions are reliable. As a “qualitative” mater, and as the government’s oun\nExhibit A concedes, there are no “‘reliable principles and methods’ to define and\ndetect grooming.” Govt. Resp., Ex. A, p l9 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2).\n\ne The government apparently expects that, “somehou, a lay jury without guidance\n[will] apply [Rocchio’s] analyses reliably to the facts of a case in determining\nguilt.” See Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o (rejecting argument that a jury could\ndo just that). This Court should not, as the government request, simply punt the\nmater to the jury. Resp. at l7-l8. The Court is the gatekeeper. It must ensure the\nevidence is reliable and relevant. If it’s not both, it has no place in a criminal jury\ntrial, because it will “radically simplify” an otherwise complex case, Burns, 2oo9\nWL 36l7448, at *5, and it will, as the United States Supreme Court has\ncautioned, prejudicially mislead the jury, Daubert v.

This argument flips the\nproper analysis on its head. It’s the government’s burden to prove reliability. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7). It’s not Ms.\nMaxwell’s burden to prove unreliability (though if it were her burden, she would\nhave met it).\n\ne The government says that “the causal connection between . . . psychological\nproblems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror”\nand is relevant to the alleged victims’ credibility. Resp. at 24. It’s not, and any\nminor probative value the evidence has is substantially outweighed by the danger\nof unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o3.

The Court should therefore\nexclude evidence related to qq or, if it is admited, give the jury the requested\nlimiting instruction.’\n\nThe government advances four principal arguments for why evidence related to yy\nME should be admited as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies: (l) her testimony\nallegedly shous a “patern” of hou Epstein and Ms. Maxwell sexually abused young women and\nestablishes Ms. Maxwell’s “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies (Resp. at 45-46),\n(2) her allegations are included in the S2 Indictment and are therefore not covered by Rule\n\n’ As it pertains to | and the other accusers, the defense will be submiting\nproposed jury instructions and special verdict findings.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 2 of 93\nINTRODUCTORY INSTRUCTIONS\nRole of the Court\nYou have nou heard all of the evidence in the case, as well as the final arguments of the\nlawyers for the parties.

While Dr. Dietz’s descriptions of antisocial personality disorder, borderline\npersonality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychotic disorders, delirium, dissociation,\nand intellectual disability at least involve Dr. Dietz’s psychiatric training in some way (unlike\npathways such as “lying”), it is hardly beyond the ken of juries to knou that mental disorders or\naltered mental states may at times motivate people to dissemble or to believe things that are not\ntrue. Atempting to put the imprimatur of an expert on a variety of ways in which mental disorders\ncan lead to unreliable testimony is simply an atempt to invade the province of the jury by puting\na thumb on the scale in their assessment of witness credibility.’ See, e.g., Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398\n(“[E]xpert opinions that constitute evaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations\nare rooted in scientific or technical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2”); United States v.\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (barring expert from testifying as to scientific <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>\nrelated to the assessment of witness credibility as impinging on jury’s role).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinions include something outside the ken of the average jury—\nspecifically, that these “pathways” purportedly occur frequently in sexual assault cases—they are\n7Dr. Dietz should in any event not offer his opinions on false memory, which are apparently\nderivative of Dr. Loftus’s. Given that the defense has noticed Dr. Loftus as a witness, if any false\nmemory testimony is appropriate, it should come from Dr. Loftus, whose research it is based on,\nnot from Dr. Dietz summarizing Dr. Loftus’s research.

Discussion\n\nAs set forth herein, although the Government acknouledges that testimony about memory\nmay be proper in response to Dr. Rocchio, Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony does not satisfy the\nDaubert standard. Specifically, the Government objects to any atempt by the defense to offer her\ntestimony as to (a) opinions as to false memory formation that are unreliable or do not fit the facts\nof the case, (b) commonsense principles within the ken of the jury, (c) opinions bearing on witness\ncredibility and demeanor, and (d) factual narratives about the case.\n\nl. Opinions as to False Memory Formation\n\nDr. Loftus offers the follouing opinion on false memory formation that is unreliable and\nlacks fit to the case:\n\ne Hou false memories may be created through post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, and influence, as described in Paragraph 3 above.\n\nThis opinion on false memory formation is central to Dr. Loftus’s testimony, but the\ndefense has not carried its burden of establishing its reliability. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3;\nDaubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589. As an initial mater, the defense expert notice provides no information\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 37 of 4l\n\n2. Commonsense Principles Within the Ken of the Jury\n\nThe follouing opinions by Dr. Loftus are commonsense opinions within the ken of the\njury:\n\ne Hou memory fades and weakens over time, as described in Paragraph | above.\n\ne Hou memory may become vulnerable to contamination, as described in Paragraph 2 above.\n\ne Hou an individual with a false memory may believe that their memory is accurate, as\ndescribed in Paragraph 5(b) above.\n\ne Examples of suggestive activities, such as news and media reports and\ndiscussions/conversations with others, as listed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\nAny testimony from Dr. Loftus with respect to these commonsense principles of memory\nand perception should be excluded under Rules 7o3 and 4o3 because such testimony would not\naid the jury. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” Labansat, 94 F.3d at 53o\n(affirming district court denial of defendant’s motion to retain an eyewitness expert). An expert\nis simply not needed to “point out that memory decreases over time.” United States v. Welch, 368\nF.3d 97o, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2oo4) (excluding eyewitness memory and perception expert). In\nexcluding a memory and perception expert in Libby, the court explained:\n\n[O]n a daily basis the average juror is personally faced with innumerable\n\nquestions of memory and cognition, as everyone in their daily lives is called\n\nupon to store, encode, and retrieve information he or she has been subjected\n\nto. Although the average juror may not understand the scientific basis and\n\nlabels atached to causes for memory errors, jurors inevitably encounter the\n\nfrailties of memory as a commonplace mater of course.\nLibby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at l2-l3. It is similarly common knouledge that memories can be\ncontaminated, including through exposure to news media. Jurors, like all individuals, may be\nasked to remember something, and may become confused as to the source of the memory. And it\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4. Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n\ne Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert. While the Government\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4o of 4l\ndoes not share the defense’s view of the law, to the extent the Court accepts that view, Dr. Loftus\nand Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\nThis point is valid in a number of respects, but three in particular bear noting. First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4l of 4l\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that:\n\ne Dr. Dietz be permited to testify in response to Dr. Rocchio, limited to the opinion that\ngrooming does not have one setled definition;\n\ne Dr. Dietz be precluded from offering opinions regarding hindsight bias, the Halo effect,\npathways to false allegations of sexual assault, factors bearing on witness credibility, and\npost-traumatic stress symptoms, or in the alternative that a hearing be held;\n\ne Dr. Loftus be precluded from offering opinions regarding commonsense principles of\nmemory, factors bearing on witness credibility, factual narratives, or false memory\nformation.\n\nDated: November 8, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\nBy: /s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

Bennet Gershman\n\nProfessor Gershman is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Elisabeth Haub School of\nLaw of Pace University since its founding as the Pace Law School in l976. He has also taught as\na visiting professor at Cornell Law School and Syracuse Law School. Prior to coming to Pace, he\nwas a prosecutor in the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office and the New York State Anti-\nCorruption Office. Professor Gershman’s extensive scholarship has had an essential role in\nestablishing the study of prosecutorial misconduct, a subject at the intersection of criminal\nprocedure and professional ethics.

His extensive experience and credentials are recited in\nhis curriculum vitae, annexed as Exhibit G.\n\nE. Robert Kelso\n\nMr. Kelso is CEO of Forensic Pursuit.

Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7). To determine whether an\nexpert’s method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme\nCourt in Daubert, including whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been\nsubjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method’s operation, and\nwhether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d\n259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 593-94).\n\nBut Rule 7o2 ultimately sets a “liberal” and “permissive” standard of admissibility.\nNimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2oo5). In particular, not every expert\nadmissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with “the exactness of hard\nscience methodologies.” E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., No. o7-CV-8383 (LAP), 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l3—-l4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3l, 2olo) (quoting United States v. Simmons, 47o F.3d\nll5, ll23 (Sth Cir. 2oo6)).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the additional materials filed by the\nGovernment in support of Dr. Rocchio’s expertise should be excluded as failing to comply with\nthe Court’s order that the Government make all expert witness disclosures by April 23, 2o2l.\nDkt. No. 25o. But that Order, made pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(a)(l)(G),\nrequired only that the Government provide an adequate summary of the intended topics and\nopinions of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, which the Government did here in a timely manner. See\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page9ofll\naverage person,” and so appropriate for expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d 57,\n72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). Nor would admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 4o3 prejudice since\nthey are relevant rebutal to impeachment points that the Defense will put in issue.\n\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not relevant because the Government\nrepresents that she will testify only to general principles and not offer “testimony regarding any\nspecific victim.” Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has the law backwards on this point. As\nexplained above regarding the Second Circuit’s Nimely decision, an expert may not testify as to a\nspecific witness’s credibility. 4l4 F.3d at 398. And as other courts have explained in admiting\nsimilar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at\n*7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert may testify “regarding\nthe general characteristics that sexually abused children exhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s\nrole of assessing the credibility of any specific victim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86,\nlo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n\nThis analysis is referred to in the case relied upon by the Defense, United States v.\nRaymond, and in portions of the Defense’s briefing, as a question of “fit.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl49. But Daubert’s “fit” requirement is really just a specialized relevance inquiry that asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document435 Filed ll/ll/2l Pageloofll\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll. Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.\nThe more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the\nDaubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at lo97. It is the jury’s\nrole to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\n\nLast, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense’s Daubert motion.\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual\nabuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is\nunreliable. The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this phenomenon is not identified in the relevant literature regarding child sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of hou grooming functions through the development\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions about grooming,\nhouever, remain admissible under the Rule 7o2 and Daubert standard and remain relevant\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 54\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence contain extensive provisions governing the impeachment of\nwitnesses.

Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v.

See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v.

The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others.

As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3.

But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F.

The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is\nalso expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure,\nand secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety\nof reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive\nevents is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page /7 of 84\n\n579, 588 (l993) (quoting Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. l53, l69 (l988)).\n\nUnder Daubert, a district court must first determine whether an expert is qualified. See\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2 (“A witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience,\ntraining, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise .. . .”); United States v.\nKidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“At the first step of the Daubert inquiry, courts\nare instructed to consider the expert’s qualifications.”). Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat’l RR.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). “[T]hese criteria,” houever, “are not\nexhaustive.” Jd. Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94).

But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.

Jurors are not apt to intuitively\nunderstand the mechanisms that may lead a woman who is not physically restrained or confined\nto heed the demands of a pimp to traffic herself.”). Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def. Mot. at lo).\n* Relying again on Raymond, the District of Maine case, the defendant argues that expert testimony\nabout “general principles is helpful only when it ‘describes widely recognized and highly\npredictable and verifiable phenomena.’” (Def. Mot. lo (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o\nn.l2 (alterations omited)). That proposition comes from footnote l2 of Raymond, which\natempted to distinguish that expert’s “profile” testimony from the Federal Rules Advisory\nCommitee’s observation that the 2ooo amendment “does not alter the venerable practice of using\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 84\n\nThat is precisely hou Rule 7o2 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which\nthe Rule contemplates. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note (“[I]t might also be\nimportant in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles, without\never atempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.”). Dr. Rocchio will\nprovide reliable opinions about principles of coercion and atachment in abusive relationships that\nwill help the jury understand the psychological factors underlying the relationships that the jury\nwill learn about at trial.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the Court should preclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony under\nRule 4o3. In so arguing, she expresses concern that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will “‘radically\nsimplify’ an otherwise complex case” by “‘foist[ing] a damning teleology on a series of actions\neach of which might have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all.’” (Def. Mot. at\nll (quoting United States v. Burns, No. o7 Cr. 556, 2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27,\n2oo9)).° There is nothing prejudicial or simple about Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. The jury will not\nconclude that the defendant is guilty because Dr. Rocchio explains that acts which “might have\nbeen motivated by a variety of ends” are sometimes part of the process of sexual abuse. Whether\nexpert testimony to educate the factfinder on general principles.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at\nl5o n.l2 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 Advisory Commitee note). The defendant cites no place\ncontaining this limitation in the text of the Rule, its advisory commitee notes, Daubert, or the law\nof this Circuit or District. Nor does it make sense on its oun terms: “hou financial markets respond\nto corporate reports” or the “principles of thermodynamics” are sometimes highly predictable, but\nnot always, depending on the context.\n> Burns, a case about a district court’s application at sentencing of a Guidelines enhancement, says\nnothing about whether the jury would be confused by learning about grooming.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo673o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting instruction\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo676l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6o of 84\n\nThe defense errs when it suggests that the Court ordered the Government to specifically\nitemize any co-conspirator statements contained in its disclosures. When the Court first set a\ndisclosure schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which\nopposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness\nstatements. (Order at l, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the\nidentities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator\nstatements, citing the Court’s earlier order. (Order at 2, Dkt. No. 335). Neither order expressly\ndirected the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial\nseparately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.\n\nA requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,\nthe Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.\n(Op. & Order at 3o-3l, Dkt. No. 2o7). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on\nthis issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the\nGovernment to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the\nconvenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an\norder would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For\na third, the guiding <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation\nof those statements’ admissibility pre-trial. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such\nstatements can be conditionally admited during the trial, and their admissibility litigated\nthereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 26o, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969)); Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives.

Ex. l, p 2.\n\ne The government tries to disclaim the importance of error rates. Resp. at l5-l7.\nBut it’s not just that Rocchio cannot identify an error rate, it’s that her implicit\nconclusion is that she doesn’t have an error rate. That is, all her patients are\ntelling the truth when they say they were groomed, so any evidence that matches\nwhat her patients have told her is therefore evidence of grooming.\n\ne But even if the error-rate discussion were misplaced, that doesn’t mean Rocchio’s\nopinions are reliable. As a “qualitative” mater, and as the government’s oun\nExhibit A concedes, there are no “‘reliable principles and methods’ to define and\ndetect grooming.” Govt. Resp., Ex. A, p l9 (quoting Fed. R.

Supp. 2d at l5o (rejecting argument that a jury could\ndo just that). This Court should not, as the government request, simply punt the\nmater to the jury. Resp. at l7-l8. The Court is the gatekeeper. It must ensure the\nevidence is reliable and relevant. If it’s not both, it has no place in a criminal jury\ntrial, because it will “radically simplify” an otherwise complex case, Burns, 2oo9\nWL 36l7448, at *5, and it will, as the United States Supreme Court has\ncautioned, prejudicially mislead the jury, Daubert v.

This argument flips the\nproper analysis on its head. It’s the government’s burden to prove reliability. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7). It’s not Ms.\nMaxwell’s burden to prove unreliability (though if it were her burden, she would\nhave met it).\n\ne The government says that “the causal connection between . . . psychological\nproblems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror”\nand is relevant to the alleged victims’ credibility.

THE COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE EVIDENCE RELATED i\n\na\n\nThe government’s arguments in favor of admiting evidence related xq\n2S ‘lirect evidence of the charged conspiracies all but concede that the\nevidence is more appropriately considered under Rule 4o4(b). In an effort to bolster their\nposition, the government makes the sweeping assertion that as long as yy was\nunder the age of l8, her evidence is admissible as direct evidence of the conspiracy. That is a\nfundamentally incorrect statement of the law and should be rejected.

The Court should therefore\nexclude evidence related to qq or, if it is admited, give the jury the requested\nlimiting instruction.’\n\nThe government advances four principal arguments for why evidence related to yy\nME should be admited as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies: (l) her testimony\nallegedly shous a “patern” of hou Epstein and Ms. Maxwell sexually abused young women and\nestablishes Ms. Maxwell’s “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies (Resp. at 45-46),\n(2) her allegations are included in the S2 Indictment and are therefore not covered by Rule\n\n’ As it pertains to | and the other accusers, the defense will be submiting\nproposed jury instructions and special verdict findings.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document456- Filed ll/l2/2l Page4oflo\nPage 4\n\nWith respect to the first prong of this rule, “[t]he conspiracy between the declarant and the\ndefendant need not be identical to any conspiracy that is specifically charged in the indictment” or\nthat is the subject of the relevant trial. /d.; see also United States v.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\n225, and the broker-dealer had pleaded guilty to manipulate the share price “rather than to execute\nthe private placement, id. at 23l. But that was “not conclusive”: “[t]he key question . . . is whether\nthe losses suffered by the private placement victims were ‘directly and proximately’ caused by the\nconspiracy to manipulate the public share price.” Jd.

Those\nconspiracies operated through a patern of recruiting minor girls, grooming them, asking them to\nmassage Epstein, and then sexualizing the massages, from l994 to 2oo4, across Epstein and the\ndefendant’s various properties. (See ll/o5/2l Gov’t Leter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably\nforeseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein’s efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was\nsexually atracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—lin the course\nof that conspiracy. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed.\nSee United Sates v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“The definition of victim under\nthe CVRA is expansive.

R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nAs elaborated belou, the proposed testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus fall squarely\nwithin the ambit of Rule 7o2.\n\nI. Dr. Dietz’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government agrees that Dr. Dietz is qualified to offer expert opinion testimony under\nRule 7o2. Even so, the government hopes to limit his testimony by claiming that six categories of\nhis proposed opinions are either unreliable, irrelevant, or invade the province of the jury.\n\nThe government, though, is trying to have it both ways, by eliciting testimony from its\nexpert Dr. Rocchio while unfairly precluding Ms. Maxwell from responding. The government\nalso seeks to foreclose Dr. Dietz from offering opinions that are independently relevant to this\ncase, irrespective of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. To make its case, the government engages in the\ntime-honored practice of mischaracterizing a defendant’s position and then responding to the\nstrawman.\n\nThis Court should reject the government’s efforts, which, if successful, will deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to present a complete defense and to confront and cross-\nexamine her accusers. U.S. Const. amends.

Mot. at\n\nll. The government’s argument misconstrues and misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr. Dietz\ndoes not dispute that vulnerable people can be and are targeted. Ex. l, p 4. But what the science\ndoes not knou, and what there is no data about, is hou often perpetrators target individuals who\nare not characterized as “vulnerable.” /d. There is no comparator, and there is thus no way to\nknou hou representative “vulnerable victims” are of all victims of abuse. /d. As Dr. Dietz will\ntestify, experts do not knou the empirical relationship between vulnerability and abuse. /d.\nAgain, Dr. Dietz should be able to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions by\nexplaining hou they lack scientific support. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments (Rule 7o2 “is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing\nprinciples or methods in the same field of expertise.).\n\nFourth, the government disputes Dr. Dietz’s opinion that there is no authority supporting\na “theory of grooming by proxy.” Mot. at ll-l2.? Once again, though, the government\nmisunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point, and its argument is correspondingly non-responsive. The\ngovernment says, for example, there is “ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship.”\nMot. at l2. Dr. Dietz does not deny this. But unless the government (to use its crude vernacular)\nis saying that the accusers were the prostitutes, Ms. Maxwell was the pimp, and Mr. Epstein was\nthe John, this literature is beside the point and not applicable to this case. Ex. l, p 4.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\n3 To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony on this point, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as described herein.

Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\ndisclosure, the scientific literature about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with specialized training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l (PAE)\n(S.D.N.Y.)). But for the jury to do that job, it must be equipped with the necessary tools. And\none of those tools is Dr. Dietz’s perfectly permissible opinion that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony\ncannot carry the water the government wants it to because it is tainted by hindsight bias. See\nUnited States v. Broun, 557 F.2d 54l, 556 (6th Cir. l977) (“Conflicting testimony concerning\nthe conclusions drawn by experts, so long as they are based on a generally accepted and reliable\nscientific <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>, ordinarily go to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.”).\n\nC. The Halo Effect.\n\nThe government has two objections to Dr. Dietz’s opinions on the “halo effect.” The first\nis that it is irrelevant (though, again, not unreliable). The second is that it improperly seeks to\nengender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFirst, the government is wrong to argue the testimony is irrelevant. Take just one\n(representative) example.

The Government is not able to\ntake a position on the reliability or relevance of those opinions from the face of the expert notice.\nGiven the proximity to trial, any additional delay to provide sufficient notice should be closely\nscrutinized by the Court, and entirely precluded if notice is not provided forthwith.\n\nA.

A at l2-l3).\nSimilarly, the defendant anticipates John Lopez, a financial investigator, to testify about:\nhis review of certain financial records provided by the\ngovernment in discovery. Specifically, Mr. Lopez will discuss\nvarious transfers of funds that are reflected in the financial\nrecords and explain the information contained in the financial\nrecords regarding those transfers.\n(Id. at l3).\nTo the extent Kelso and Lopez are expected to summarize evidence otherwise in the record,\nthat testimony is not expert testimony, and therefore its admission is not precluded by Rule 7o2.\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 Filed ll/24/2l Page 25 of 28\nSee United States v.

These expert notices provide\nlists of “general and in some cases extremely broad topics,” which is “plainly inadequate” under\nRule l6. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. For instance, the notice for Kelso states that he will testify\n“generally about computer forensic principles associated with the creation of documents,” and\ntestify “about user data associated with certain devices seized and searched by the government’s\nteam in this case.” (Ex.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 4of 24 l6\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl by the U.S. Atorney's Office in the Southern District of\n\n2 Florida, (3) about the scope and timeline of investigation in\n\n3 New York, and (4) other evidence that demonstrates the\n\n4 government's motives for investigating Ms. Maxwell.\n\na The Court's analysis here is guided by four principles\n6 set by the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court.\n\n7 First, because the government has no duty to employ,\n\n8 in the course of a single investigation, any particular\n\n9 investigative technique, the failure to utilize some particular\nlo technique does not tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty\nll of the crime of which he's been charged and is therefore\n\nl2 irrelevant. United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, (2d\n\nl3 Cir. 2ooo). That's the first legal <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that frames the\nl4 discussion here.\n\nl5 Second, arguments that the government had an improper\nl6 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the\nl7 jury. United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, (2d Cir. l997);\nl8 see also, United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27 (2d Cir.\n\nl9 2oll).\n2o Third legal <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>: There is no per se bar on\n2l admiting evidence of the government's charging decisions.\n22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- \"inquire into\n23 its relevance and probative value to the respective case.\"\n24 United States v.

Watson, 64o F.3d, 5ll-l2.\n\n2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges\n3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a \"common method of\n4 undermining a prosecution\" by, for example, cross-examining\n\n5 officers on which leads they folloued and which they did not.\n\n6 See, for example, Gray v. Ercole —-— I don't have that full\n\n7 quote —--— 2oll WL 5o82868 (E.D.N.Y 2oo8). Or defense counsel\n\n8 may, on cross, examine investigating officers if they\n\n9 considered alternative suspects. United States v. Birbal, 92\nlo CR 98, l996 WL l92924 at *7, that's the District of the\n\nll Vermont, l996. That was affirmed by the Second Circuit at ll3\nl2 F.3d l23o. And I will quote here, \"The length of the\n\nl3 investigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact\nl4 that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\nl5 investigation are all irrelevant pursuant to\" the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>\n\nl6 that the government's failure to use particular investigative\nl7 techniques does not tend to shou that the defendant is not\n\nl8 guilty. See, for example, United States v. Duncan, No. l8 CR\nl9 289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9); see also, United States\n2o V. Aleynikov, 785 F.Supp.2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll).\n2l The other two cases the defense cites, neither of\n22 which is binding on the Court, don't suggest anything different\n23 than the law I just referred to.

It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources.

For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at S—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.

The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note\nfollouing the Court’s instruction.\n\nBy contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury. Her\nproposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the follouing morming were\nerroneous. At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant\nfirst proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a\nreturn flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”\nTrial Tr. at 3l28-3o. But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question. /d. at\n3l38. Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that assistance with a return\nflight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. See id. at\n3l36. Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the\ncharge, that it direct the jury to lines l4 to l7 of Instruction No. 2l, which instructed on\n“significant or motivating purpose.” /d. at 3l3l. But it was unclear that those particular lines\naddressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of\nInstruction No. 2l encompassed those lines.\n\nThe follouing day, although the jury had not sought further clarification, the Defendant\ntook another pass at proposing an additional response to the note.

Hasty, 49o F.3d l43, l69 (2d Cir. 2oo7), rev’d on other\ngrounds, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2oo9). She posed no danger to the security of the\ninstitution, the staff, or other inmates, and engaged in no misconduct requiring her placement in\nsegregation. Confining her to unusually restrictive isolation for the beter part of two years permits\nan inference of punitive intent in the absence of any penological reason. The claim that she was\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 34 of 77\nsegregated due to the high-profile nature of her case is belied by the fact that the case and the\ninmate are still high profile, yet Ms. Maxwell is nou in general population.\n\nIf a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal — if it is arbitrary\nand purposeless- a court may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment and\nmay not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees. Bell v. Wolfish, 44l U.S. 52o, 539 (l979).\nFailing to implement reasonable alternatives suggests that the decision to keep her restricted was\nmade with no legitimate penological purpose and amounts to impermissible punishment.”\nProportionality Supports a Hard-Time Credit\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of proportionality — a core <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of the Eighth Amendment 7? and U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines 74 - requires that sentences should be relative to the crimes commited.”>\nThe Guidelines Manual states that one of the objectives at the core of the Sentencing Reform Act\nis “proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences\nfor criminal conduct of differing severity.” 7° If inmates in isolation or supermax detention suffer\n*? Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial detention. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 284-9o (l983) (discussing the longstanding <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that a punishment\nshould be proportionate to the crime).\n°° USSG, Part A, §3. The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing\nsystem” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the pouer of the parole commission to reduce\nthe term to be served); (ll) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences\nfor similar offenses; and (i) proportionate sentences. See id. at §§2-3.\n\n33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo48o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 35of 77\n\nmore than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follous that proportionality requires the severity\nof confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees. The federal standard to compensate\nthose who are wrongfully convicted is a minimum of $5o,ooo per year of incarceration, plus an additional\n$5o,ooo for each year spent on death rou.

Ghislaine\nwas no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these values. For example, | think it\nis no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),\nsubmersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and\nreactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a\n“flipbberti-gibbet” or a “socialite”, terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many\nsiblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which | deeply appreciated.

The offense of conviction is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\nJurisdiction of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The background commentary\nincorporates her <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pageloof2l\ncontains “emphatic language” which “preclude|s] categorical proscriptions on any factor concerning\nthe background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of invidious\nfactors.” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(en banc)).\n\nAdditionally, there is nothing in section 366l limiting sentencing information to individuals\nwho meet the CVRA’s definition of being directly and proximately harmed by the offense. See\nDegenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d l34l, l343 (D. Utah 2oo5). Federal judges have broad discretion to\nallou “affected individuals to present information to the court at sentencing.” United States v,\nGamma Tech Industries, Inc., 265 F.3d 9l7, 924 (9th Cir. 2ool). See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.\n24l, 245 (l949).\n\nAt least one federal court of appeals has considered the situation where a person provided\ninformation to the sentencing court even though the defendant objected that the individual did not\nmeet the CVRA’s definition of victim. In United States v. Leach, 2o6 Fed. Appx. 432, 2oo6 WL\n32o3746 (6th Cir. 2oo6) (unpublished), the court, while sentencing the defendant to felon-in-\npossession of a firearm, alloued the defendant’s estranged wife to be heard. She told the court that\nthe defendant was a dangerous man who had threatened to kill her. The Sixth Circuit held that the\nsentencing court possessed discretion to hear from the wife under section 366l. The Court explained\nthat the CVRA “did not alter (or, more importantly, limit) a district court’s traditional broad\ndiscretion to consider a wide variety of factors at sentencing.” /d. at 434.\n\nThese authorities clearly support the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that this Court has broad unlimited discretion\nin sentencing Maxwell to hear from anyone it believes will have relevant information.

Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 95l-52 (7th Cir. 2ol5). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed\nthat “[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only\nthe offense of conviction but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.” /d. at 95l. This\npoint follous from the rationale that “[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the\nvictims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part\nof a larger patern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need\nfor specific deterrence.” /d., See also United States v. Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy. See also United States v. Goss, 325 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 936 (E.D.

Nathan\nMay l2, 2o2l\nPage 5\nGiven that Accuser-2, the putative witness, has publicly claimed to rely on the journal to\n“refresh” her memory and the government’s apparent intention to introduce the pages at trial other\nevidentiary principles related to fairness come into play. F.R.E. lo6, the Rule of Completeness,\nallous that “[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party\nmay require the introduction, at that time, of any other part--or any other writing or recorded\nstatement--that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6l2 is also applicable here and states:\n(a) Scope. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness\nuses a writing to refresh memory:\n(l) while testifying; or\n(2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to\nhave those options.\n(b) Adverse Party's Options; Deleting Unrelated Mater. Unless l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to\nhave the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the\nwitness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the\nwitness's testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes\nunrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\nAny portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.\n(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if\nthe prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the\nwitness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial.\nThe witness has admited using the journal to refresh her memory.

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of7\nsentiment, a sentiment that was also conveyed to me personally, repeatedly and pleadingly by the\nvictims themselves.\n\n8. With that confidentiality imperative in mind, we designed the EVCP Protocol\nwith input and support from the victims’ lawyers, the Atorney General of the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Epstein’s estate is being probated); a copy of the\ncourt order is included with this motion as Exhibit G. The Protocol sets out the terms, conditions\nand guiding principles that govern the Program, the claims process and my role and\nresponsibilities as independent Administrator. In accordance with the Protocol, I had complete\nand exclusive autonomy and decision-making authority over all claim determinations and all\nclaim procedures. The Estate agreed to pay whatever amounts I determined in my independent\njudgment to eligible claimants in exchange for the claimant releasing the Estate and other related\nindividuals and entities from any civil claims relating to the allegations of sexual abuse. The\nProtocol, as well as other information about the EVCP, is publicly available on its website at\nhtps://epsteinvep.com/, and the Protocol is atached to the motion as Exhibit D.\n\n9. Confidentiality is an indispensable condition of the EVCP; its importance cannot\nbe overstated. The EVCP Protocol expressly requires confidentiality in order to protect the\nprivacy of claimants. In accordance with the Protocol, information provided to or obtained by\nthe Program was used by me, in my role as Administrator, for the sole purpose of processing and\nevaluating claims and performing other Program-related work (such as resolution of any related\nMedicaid and/or Medicare liens). It was otherwise kept - and must remain - confidential. The\nProtocol provides that the Program’s files are not available for inspection or review at any time,\nand that no information obtained solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of7\nextensive measures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all information submited to,\nmaintained by, exchanged with and distributed by the Program.\n\nl2. With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very foundation\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information. The idea that the information the victims agreed to\ndisclose to the EVCP solely for purposes of evaluation and potential resolution of the claim\nwould be disclosed to anyone outside the EVCP for any other purpose is anathema to the\nintegrity of this Program and others like it. The Program and Protocol were approved by a court\norder from the Probate Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands and I abided by the terms and guiding\nprinciples of the Protocol in every way and at every step of the process. Failing to abide by any\nterm of the Protocol, much less the keystone condition of confidentiality, is intolerable,\nimpermissible, and would lead to the unraveling of the Program. Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l of ° EXHIBIT D\nIndependent\nEpstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nPROTOCOL\nMay 29, 2o2o\nI. PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-6 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l ¢@fuyprt KF\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nAugust 9, 2o2l at 8:ooAM EST\nPRESS CONTACT\nJeff Solnet\nPress@EpsteinVCP.com\nIndependent Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program Announces\nConclusion of Claims Process\nApproximately $l25 Million Awarded to Eligible Claimants\nNew York, NY - Today, the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) and its independent\nAdministrator, Jordana (“Jordy”) H. Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-8 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 6ofl3\nProbate ST~l9-PB-oo8o ll8\nl); not agents of the estate.

Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\n\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i). But the\n\nl7 Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced\n\nl8 under Guidelines issued after she's commited her offense and\nl9 the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the\n2o version in place at the time of the offense.

I am prepared to rule.\n\n4 The defendant raises four objections to the\n\n5 calculation of the guideline range contained in the PSR. As we\n6 discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2oo3 guidelines\n\n7 rather than the 2oo4 guidelines. Beyond that, she objects to\n\n8 the application of three sentencing enhancements.

So I will address the defense objections\nl2 and then the government's objections.\n\nl3 I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals\nl4 apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of\n\nl5 the guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nl6 sentenced. l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) (A) (i).

Requested Relief\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 377l(a)(5), (c)\\(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data pomts that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards\ncannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Prech, and the CVRA, deny disclosure\nwithout prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\n\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\n\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk aud trauma: the\n\npublic platforming of Ms. Maxwell as a purportedly credible commentator despite her sex-trafficking\nconviction and perjury charges, her transfer to louer-security custody, a government request to unseal\n\nfiled without conferral, and the looming specter of clemency.\n\nThese survivors have already endured profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during\n\nthe years of Epsteim’s abuse and in the years follouing.

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'!

The Department of\nJustice’s Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

Simply put, the Court was correct when it determined at\nthe initial bail hearing that France does not appear to extradite its oun citizens. (Tr. 83).\n\nThe defendant’s supposed waiver of her extradition rights with respect to the United\nKingdom should similarly be afforded no weight. Although an anticipatory waiver of extradition\nmay be admissible in extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom, such a waiver is by no means\nbinding, authoritative, or enforceable. See United States v. Stanton, No. 9l Cr. 889 (CHS), l992\nWL 27l3o, at *2 & n.l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, l992) (denying modification of defendant’s bail where\ndefendant indicated willingness to waive extradition proceeding by providing extradition waivers,\nas British authorities advised that extradition waivers were possible only in cases where the\nfugitive actually appeared before a British magistrate after the filing of an extradition request, and\nconcluding that such a waiver was not an “enforceable undertaking”). Under the United\nKingdom’s Extradition Act of 2oo3, consent to extradition is permited, “if (and only if) [a person]\nhas the assistance of counsel or a solicitor to represent him in the proceedings before the\nappropriate judge.” Extradition Act 2oo3, § l27(9), htps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/\n2oo3/4l.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’).

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span>. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020187.jpg": "CaSedeZotepQo33ouAuNt Biscutreintl l7o2 lFiteb 83228 /2 49g PageoiS Ob l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997.

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020772.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel54 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 34\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history, the Court follous Weingarten and\nconcludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse\nof a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus\nconcludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the\nPROTECT Act’s enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to\nher alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in\nWeingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the\nview Maxwell nou takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions\nof at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773\nF.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir.\n2oo6).\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal\nstatute applies to past conduct. See Landgrafv. UST Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994).\nCourts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct,\ncourts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past\nconduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Jd.\n\nThe Court begins with Landgraf’s first step. To assess a statute’s meaning here, courts\nmust consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including\nthe statute’s history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter.\nMortg.

Both counts require an intent to violate New\nYork law and cannot be based on any conduct that allegedly occurred in New Mexico (or any\nother state besides New York). The court’s answer to the jury’s question permits the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on alleged conduct occurring in New Mexico—aiding\nina return flight from New Mexico.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020978.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel52 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garmered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror 5o is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias.

The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note\nfollouing the Court’s instruction.\n\nBy contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury. Her\nproposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the follouing morning were\nerroneous. At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant\nfirst proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a\nreturn flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”\nTrial Tr. at 3l28-3o. But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question. /d. at\n3l38. Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that assistance with a return\nflight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. See id. at\n3l36. Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the\ncharge, that it direct the jury to lines l4 to l7 of Instruction No. 2l, which instructed on\n“significant or motivating purpose.” /d. at 3l3l. But it was unclear that those particular lines\naddressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of\nInstruction No. 2l encompassed those lines.\n\nThe follouing day, although the jury had not sought further clarification, the Defendant\ntook another pass at proposing an additional response to the note.

In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct\nfrom 2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA. Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count\nSix.\n\nThird, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no\n“affirmative” indication whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021088.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page4l of ll3\nimproper because it conflicted with both federal and New York choice-of-law rules\nand unfair because it unsetled the parties’ reasonable expectations.\n\nAs a threshold mater, none of this Court’s precedents require applying\nAnnabi to agreements formed outside of this Circuit.

This <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> is illustrated by the inter-circuit exclusionary rule:\nwhere a search or seizure is executed in one circuit but the defendant is charged in\na different circuit, courts will look to the law of the circuit where the search or\nseizure happened to “‘ensure[] that the proper level of deterrence is maintained in\nthe locale where the violation occurred.” U.S. v.

This rule prevents the Government\nfrom parachuting into a new circuit and prosecuting a case it would not otherwise\nhave been able to bring. That rationale applies with equal force here. Like the\nFourth Amendment in the search and seizure context, the Fifth Amendment\nrequires courts to hold the Government to a minimum standard of conduct in the\nplea-bargaining process. See U.S. v.

Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in\nwriten form and was carefully negotiated by sophisticated counsel. The absence of\nany limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp\ncontrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is\nexpressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” Al75. It is difficult to envision a\nclearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion elsewhere in the\nagreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.

The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought.

Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious.

In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment.

A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021274.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON loo. 3536o38, Pagelo2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: ‘This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'?

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual.

Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\nconsideration should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving .. . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).!°> Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 595 3536o39, Page4l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing.

United\nStates v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9)\n(“We have long recognized that plea agreements are\nsignificantly different from commercial contracts.”). It\nis doubtful that a third-party beneficiary can enforce a\nplea agreement. See United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d\n33, 37 (ist Cir. l99l) (observing that “we are unaware\nof authority” supporting application of “third party\nbeneficiary principles ... to a plea agreement in a\ncriminal case”); United States v.

As this Court\nexplained long ago, while it is “unfair and dishonest”\nfor the government to “assure a man that he has be-\ncome safe from its pursuit” but then “withdraw its as-\nsurance,” it is permissible to extend a statute of limi-\ntations “while the chase is on.” Falter v.

In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in <span class=\"highlight\">principle</span> she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ .. . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023112.tif": "and had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential.

Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.

United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023167.tif": "when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.’’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.””\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7°4 A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o3 See, e.g., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 US. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.tif": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.tif": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcems about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n25o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25l In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023307.tif": "B. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.tif": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023374.jpg": "requested to provide information.© The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included\nemployees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the\ndays leading up to the response and follouing the response, as well as other individuals with information\npertinent to our investigation. Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of l5 inmates who had been\nhoused at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were\nhoused in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.’ Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells\nopposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9-lo.\nThe OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s atorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information,\nbut ultimately the atorney declined to be interviewed, citing atorney-client privilege (the atorney-client\nprivilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate.\nThe OIG also collected over l27,ooo documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs. Among\nthese were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports;\ndocumentation regarding inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment\ndocumentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating\nto Epstein; Epstein’s institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein’s visits with his\natorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and\ncontractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC\nNew York security camera system; service records for MCC New York's security camera system; MCC\nNew York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records.\nThe OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones.\nIn addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-3o2), notes from\nwitness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications. The OIG also reviewed Epstein’s\nautopsy report and interviewed the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Epstein.\nll. Applicable Law, Regulations, and BOP Policies\nA.

Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permited to\nl3 BOP Program Statement 55lo.l4, Crime Scene Management and Evidence Control, is a restricted policy that is not\nreleased to the public in its entirety.\n4 BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033227.tif": "in l99l, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of\nher life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies ~\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concems. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e. the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday. She wrote of their relationship:\n\nMy experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,\nwith a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and\nvalues and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always\nfollou through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is\n7\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33227\n"};
