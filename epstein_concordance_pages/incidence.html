Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an <span class=\"highlight\">incidence</span> of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this <span class=\"highlight\">incidence</span> there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005912.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an <span class=\"highlight\">incidence</span> of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this <span class=\"highlight\">incidence</span> there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006837.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, harassment of jurors, and increased <span class=\"highlight\">incidence</span> of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . reasonable grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo983l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020148.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag PageRiss 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">incidence</span> of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Court need not hold another\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020170.jpg": "CaSeshZoero33o.AENt DoesuieAt MAEl, FitethOR/dZQel Plage Hof 2\nMINISTERE a ae ;\nDE LA JUSTICE Direction des affaires criminelles et des graces\nLiberte\nEgatite\nFraternite\nSous-direction de la justice penale specialisee\nBureau de l’entraide penale internationale .\nP Paris, le 9 mars 2o2l\nMonsieur le garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice\na\nDepartment of Justice (D.O,J)\nPar lintermediaire d’ Andrew FINKELMAN, magistrat de haison\nAmbassade des Etats-Unis d “Amerique a Paris\nJ'ai Thonneur de porter 4 votre connaissance que la procedure et les conditions\n@extradition sont regies en France par les articles 696 et suivants du code de procedure penale.\nLarticle 696-2 de ce code prevoit ainsi que « /e gouvernement francais peut remetre, sur leur\ndemande, aux fouverncments trangers, toute personne n'ayant pas la nationalite francaise qui, etant l'objet d'une\npoursuite intentee au nom de I'Etat requerant ou d'une condamnation prononcee par ses tribunaux, est trouvee sur\nke territoire de la Republique. »\nVarticle 694-4 precise expfessement que :\n« L' extradition n'est pas accordee :\nl° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite Jrangaise, cete detniere etant appreciee a\nI'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\ns\\insl, le fait que la personne recherchee ait la nationalite frangaise constitue un obstacle\ninsurmontable 4 son extradition.
