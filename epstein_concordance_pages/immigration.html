Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to transport a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan essential ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 28l9, 2327\n(2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the ques-\ntion, the Second Circuit has strongly suggested that\nMaxwell’s approach is the wrong one.

The Third Circuit reached the same\nconclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl96 (8d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the\nreasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-conviction contexts of criminal sentencing\nand <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for application of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal conviction. Id. at 59. “The language of § 32838,\nby contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That\nlinguistic expansion indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case. This reading accords with a robust\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool27", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000128.jpg": "65a\nlegislative history indicating that Congress intended\nto apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against\nchildren.

For statutes dealing with\nprior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves\n‘practical’ purposes: It promotes judicial and adminis-\ntrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past\nconvictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact.”\nMoncrieffe v.

Maxwell\nnonetheless contends that using a _ case-specific\napproach for § 3283 would be impractical because the\nGovernment would need to prove conduct beyond the\nelements of the offense. It may be true that this\napproach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense\npresents factual issues (including, at least, when the\nalleged conduct took place). This is not a serious\npractical problem and does not justify seting aside the\nstatute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States,\n346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this Court to cast\nWeingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges\naddressed a statute that extended the limitations\nperiod for defrauding the United States during the\nSecond World War. In that case, the Supreme Court\nfirst concluded that making false statements at an\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> hearing was not subject to the extended\nlimitations period because it lacked any pecuniary\nelement as required by the statute.

As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the <span class=\"highlight\">Immigration</span> and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33. As such, this motion\ndoes not offer a basis for a bill of particulars.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l25", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 348\nU.S. Department of Justice\nAtorney\nGeneral\nDeputy\nAtorney General\nGENERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL\nOFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF OFHCE OF\nSOLICITOR LEGAL POLICY PUBLIC\nGENERAL AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF OFFICE OF\nOFFICE OF COMMUNITY LEGISLATIVE LEGAL FEDERAL NATIONAL OFFICE OF\nCIVIL RIGHTS INAL\nJUSTICE eoneine, ANON CIVIL DIVISION AFFAIRS COUNSEL BUREAU OF postr SECURITY PROFESSIONAL\nPROGRAMS.

These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “(t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time. I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to institute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “TI don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 348\nl. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind <span class=\"highlight\">Immigration</span>.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>” proceedings to be initiated. !*4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to\n\ninstitute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 22\noffenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged do not require the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child.\n\nA. Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual\n\nAbuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a Child.\n\nAs demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly\nand consistently that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense\nthat necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, l4o S. Ct.\n779, 782 (2o2o) (“a court should look to the state offense’s elements” rather than case-specific\nfacts); United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (rejecting argument that “offense\nthat .. . involves” provision permited court to look to case-specific facts, even if necessary to\nsave provision from unconstitutional vagueness); Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484\n(2ol2) (interpreting “offenses that involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that\nnecessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct”) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4) (stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to\nlook to the elements and the nature of the offense . . rather than to the particular facts” at issue);\nBridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 2l7 n.l5, 22l (l953) (limiting extended statute of\nlimitations for “any offense [] involving fraud or atempted fraud against the United States” to\n“offenses in which defrauding or atempting to defraud the United States is an essential\ningredient of the offense charged”). The government’s atempt to limit this clear line of cases is\nunpersuasive.\n\nThe government claims that a “necessarily entails” approach (or, as the government\ndescribes it, a “categorical” approach) is “only used in setings like sentencing and <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>,\nwhere a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior conviction.” Opp. 39. While one\nwould expect the government to support such a statement with citations to Supreme Court cases\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3668", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 22\noutside the sentencing and <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> context in which the “necessarily entails” approach has\nbeen rejected, it fails to offer any.” Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by\nMs. Maxwell in which courts have interpreted “offense involving” language in a venue statute,\nwhich has nothing to do with sentencing, <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>, or prior convictions, to refer to the\nelements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4)\n(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) 4 2 is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue.”) (emphasis in original); United States v. Ayo, 8ol F. Supp.\n2d l323, l33l (S.D. Ala. 2oll) (“The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of\nSection 3237(a) when such transportation, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense\ncharged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”\napproach simply do not exist.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2oo9)—the only\nSupreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an\n“offense involving” statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory\nprovision at issue referred to “an offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo.” 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § llol(a)(43)(M)(i))\n(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required\n“fraud or deceit” to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced\nmonetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that\n“Tt]he words ‘in which’ (which modify ‘offense’) can refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the\n” According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the “necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need\nfor courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach\nposes a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for\nexample, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to\nprove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that\nMs. Maxwell commited the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses “involve[] . . . the sexual\nor physical abuse .. . of a child”; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be knoun which statute of\nlimitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3669", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004327.jpg": "U.S. Department of Justice\n2 2oo6 - 2oo8\n~\n—\no)\n(7)\no Atorney\nco)\n7 General\nou\n=i Deputy\na Atorney General\nSa\nKe)\n(om)\n2)\n&\nLL SOLICITOR ASSOCIATE\nGENERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\na\n\nI\noO\na OFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF OFFICE OF\n\nSOLICITOR LEGAL POLICY PUBLIC\n= GENERAL AFFAIRS\nco)\n5 “Snare OFFICE OF OFFICE OF\nNATIONAL\na OFFICE OF a iol ENTS LEGISLATIVE LEGAL FEDERAL Pranariat OFFICE OF\n5 JUSTICE ines iaegratent CIVIL DIVISION AFFAIRS COUNSEL BUREAU OF are SECURITY PROFESSIONAL\nlat PROGRAMS one INVESTIGATION DIVISION RESPONSIBILITY\nOFFICE OF INTER-\nENVIRONMENT SOE EN ee OFFICE OF THE OFFICE OF THE\n\nuw EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF ANTITRUST AND NATURAL AND PUBLIC Delcs BUREAU OF\n< ‘OFFICE FOR THE INFORMATION DIVISION RESOURCES UIASOM ENFORCEMENT PRISONS INSPECTOR PARDON\noo.

Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\nM2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4393", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 98 of 349\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4395", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page loo of 349\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time. I would like to send Jay Lefkouitz an e-mail stating that\nif we do not have a signed agreement by tomorrou at 5:oo,\nnegotiations will end.

[September 25] , when I\nplan to [file charges], and it gives the office sufficient time to review\nthe indictment package.\nDo you concur?\nA few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that\nLourie “talk to Epstein and close the deal.”!\"®\n\nWithin moments, Lourie replied to the manager, with a copy to Villafafia, reporting that he\nhad just spoken with Lefkouitz and agreed “to two fed[eral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap)\nwith nonbinding recommendation for l8 months. When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to institute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo2 of 349\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo5 of 349\nl. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind <span class=\"highlight\">Immigration</span>.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach .. . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo7 of 349\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>” proceedings to be initiated. !74\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “TI bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to\n\ninstitute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-2 Filed o9/o7/2l Page 9 of 2l\nas his lawyer Marty Weinberg would earnestly characterize Epstein’s\nbehavior modification at his bond hearing in federal court in New York on\nJuly l5, 2ol9.

Because providing\nhelp to the government is a condition of eligibility for U-Visa, and because the government must\nsupport the individual’s application by atesting to her being helpful, see 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ llol(a)(l5)(U)(i); 8 U.S.C. § ll84(p), an alleged victim’s desire for a U-Visa is pouerful\nevidence of motive and bias.\n\nDuring cross-examination, houever, Kate denied wanting a U-Visa or beginning the\nprocess of obtaining a U-Visa. TR at l276. Material produced by the government, houever,\nshous that Kate’s atorney, Brad Edwards, provided a U-Visa application to the government on\nbehalf of Kate during a proffer session. TR at l285. (35l3-o45). Ms. Maxwell intends to\nquestion Mr. Edwards about this topic.\n\nThere is nothing privileged about Mr. Edwards’ providing a U-Visa application to the\ngovernment on behalf of Kate. That testimony does not reveal a confidential communication\nbetween Mr. Edwards and Kate. See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9. But even if it did, Mr. Edwards’\nstatements to the government during the proffer session and his act of providing the application\non behalf of Kate amount to a waiver of whatever privilege that may have existed.

Brad Edwards\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Brad Edwards, counsel for Kate, to say that he provided a\nU-Visa application to the Government on behalf of Kate. This testimony, too, would not be\nprivileged, but it is irrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nKate testified that, at a meeting, she asked the Government to look into sponsoring her for\na U-Visa. (Tr. l279, l287, l3oo). She acknouledged that Edwards likely atended the meeting,\nbut did not recall whether he provided a U-Visa form to the Government (Tr. l3oo). Kate also\nexplained that her plan is simply to renew her current visa, and that the Government has made no\npromises to assist her. (Tr. l2o7-o8, l295).\n\nThe fact that Edwards provided the Government with a U-Visa application form during a\nmeeting with Kate is not relevant or impeaching of Kate. Rather, it is entirely consistent with\nKate’s testimony—specifically, that she made an inquiry about a U-Visa but was not sure whether\nher lawyer provided the Government with a U-Visa form. And the fact that her lawyer provided\nthe Government with a U-Visa form is not “pouerful evidence of motive of bias,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Leter at 6). First, as with Scarola’s proposed testimony, it could only be evidence\nof Kate’s bias to the extent she is aware of the fact, a predicate which the defense did not establish.\nSecond, it is not “pouerful” evidence of anything. Kate acknouledged asking the Government\nabout a U-Visa. Whether her lawyer, at the same time, gave the Government a partially complete\nU-Visa form is at most marginally confirming extrinsic evidence of Kate’s oun testimony. It does\nnot shou, for instance, that Kate or Edwards continued to seek a U-Visa after the meeting, that she\ncontinues to seek one nou, or that the Government has made any promises to Kate of any kind\nabout her <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> status, nor could the defense argue any of that from the anticipated\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment.

There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n?

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor.

Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021100.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Paged3 of ll3\nwitness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s\ncomputers if Epstein rejected the deal.’’)\n\ne /d. at 6o (“Villafana...reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s\nassistants in New York and to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues\nand former employees there’).\n\ne /d. at 68 (Feds considered charging Epstein under l8 USC ll3(a)(5),\nsimple assault on an airplane, indicating possible bases to charge him in\nother districts).\n\ne ld. at 69, 73, 75, 79-8o (Defense sought a government promise not to\nbring <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings against Epstein’s assistants).\n\nThe NPA and the OPR provide ample evidence that the agreement as to the\nco-conspirators was intended to bind other districts.

We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021269.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOS 3536o38, Page97 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.'!” At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the\n\nexecution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable\n2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[nJegotiations were occurring\nat nights, on weekend|[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a\ntime when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records shou her supervisors were aware that at times she\nused her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l269", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021271.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing... , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’|s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command .. . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges]... , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nHu According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nHS Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021273.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA.99 3536o38, Pagelol of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to institute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021275.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagelo3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[glood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021278.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagelo6 of 258\nSA-lo4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 348\nI. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind <span class=\"highlight\">Immigration</span>.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach ... an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021280.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo6 3536o38, Pagelo8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so ’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [Pll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.’\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>” proceedings to be initiated. l”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in aplea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl3 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\na Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to\n\ninstitute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021809.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-l, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Pagel5 of 26\napproach as opposed to a “categorical approach.”*?

Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023107.jpg": "to the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!'? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023109.jpg": "for them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “‘our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “(t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nLe According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023111.jpg": "twelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to institute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023113.jpg": "message, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer equipment.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023116.jpg": "l. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 procedure. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind <span class=\"highlight\">Immigration</span>.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023118.jpg": "precluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [ll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint recommendation for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>” proceedings to be initiated. !”4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing ina plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.jpg": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> authorities to\n\ninstitute <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span>\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023205.jpg": "Villafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”°° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\n24o The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24 Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023224.jpg": "parties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\n<span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n258 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort. . ..\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00028107.jpg": "l3:2l PQH API/HIT DATA oll3l5 aA\nC\n------ QUERY ----- LNE TERM/\nNAME DOB DATE TIME AGN RSLT TYP REF LANE API\nEPSTEIN, JEFFREY E ol2o53 l22295 l7ll INS API YQ5o C\n272o-\nAPI DATA ----\nINDICATOR 2 € CONFIRMED\nCARRIER CODE : OF QANTAS AIRWAYS LTD.\nFLT/VES NUMBER 4 lo7\nARRIVAL LOCATION : LAX LOS ANGELES, CA INTL\nDEPARTURE LOCATION : SYD KINGSFORD SMITH-SYDNEY\nTRANSMITTED BY : DILGEA AUSTRALIA <span class=\"highlight\">IMMIGRATION</span>\nINBOUND/OUTBOUND =: INBOUND\n(o) (7) (E) (o) (7) (E)\n\nKey:\n\n*A - (b) (7) (E)\n\n*B - (b) (6), (b) (7) (C)\n\n*C - (b) (7) (E)\n\n*D - (b) (7) (E)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo28lo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030367.jpg": "STATE OF FLORIDA Oe IN TH) @ DIVISION OF THECIRCUIT\nVs.

While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n; Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did not have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for <span class=\"highlight\">immigration</span> counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\nll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l"};
