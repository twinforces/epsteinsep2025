Tarantino, 846 F.2d\nl384, l4l2 (D.C. Cir. l988). Thus, statements are in furtherance of the conspiracy if they:\n(l) inform or provide an update as to the status or progress of the conspiracy, see United States v.\nDesena, 26o F.3d l5o, l58 (2d Cir. 2ool); (2) “prompt the listener . . . to respond in a way that\npromotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity,” Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at\n958; (3) “seek to induce a co-conspirator’s assistance,” Desena, 26o F.3d at l58; (4) “provide\nreassurance,” id.; (5) “serve to foster trust and cohesiveness,” id.; United States v.

For all this and many other reasons besides | hold her high in my\naffections and shall certainly continue to do so.\n\nMy sister is Aunt to l3 nieces and nephews (nou aged l8 to 37) and | have witnessed at\nfirst hand over the years her generosity to them — be it paying their school fees, mentoring\nthem as they grew up or providing job opportunities for them. She also has an enduring\ncapacity for friendship, a warm heart, and the ability to convert those feelings into action\nwhen required to help those less fortunate than herself. She has discreetly supported some\nfriends financially and others by providing a roof over their heads when they were doun on\ntheir luck, often for weeks at a time. Ghislaine has also been a truly supportive sister.\nDuring my divorce from my then wife my sister alloued me stay rent-free at her home in\nLondon for six months when | had nouhere else to go until | was able to find alternative\n\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 56 of 77\nIAN MAXWELL\nl5 Half Moon Street\nLondon, WlJ 7DZ, U.K.\naccommodation.

This is the real — the true — Ghislaine whom | knou and love as her brother.\n\nMy sister was fortunate — as | and my siblings were too - in benefiting from an\noutstanding formal education which culminated for Ghislaine with a good degree from\nOxford University. She put that <span class=\"highlight\">achievement</span> to good effect, using amongst other skills her\ngift for foreign languages and networking abilities to start up, invest in and develop\nnumerous businesses in the UK and in the US, employing people, making a difference,\nmaking a contribution.\n\nPerhaps her single most important contribution is to have converted a lifelong passion\nfor conservation and the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, to create a robust\nawareness program and a thriving social network around the oceans at a time when they\nwere perhaps not so high up the conservation agenda as they are today. TerraMar ran from\n2ol2 to 2ol9 and at its peak had hundreds of thousands of visitors to its website and many\nthousands of subscribers to its programs. None of this would have happened but for\nGhislaine’s determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and\nsheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.\nThose personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and\nsponsors), were acknouledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their l7\nSustainable Development Goals for 2ol5-3o.\n\n| believe Ghislaine still has much to contribute to the world if she is given a meaningful\nopportunity to do so.\n\nSincerely yours,\nlan Maxwell\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 59 of 77\nemergency or time off for something personal or simply being empathetic: providing time to\ntalk, to listen to someone’s problems.\n\nGhislaine’s commitment to ocean conservation and the creation of a charity that engaged\nwith literally thousands of people across the globe is an example of what her drive,\ndetermination and ability to organise can achieve.\n| urge you to take into the balance of your consideration about sentencing, notwithstanding\nthe gravity of the offences of which she has been found guilty, Ghislaine’s previous lifetime\ngood character, the high regard and continuing love and esteem of her friends and family\nbased on a lifetime’s knouledge of her, her character, conduct and achievements; the very\nreal hope and expectation that she be alloued to participate with and contribute to once\nmore her family, friends and society at large.\nYours sincerely\nKevin Maxwell\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l87 of 246 2482\nLCGVMAX5 Loftus - redirect\n\nl THE COURT: Okay.\n\n2 (Counsel conferred)\n\n3 MS.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\n<span class=\"highlight\">achievement</span> to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\n<span class=\"highlight\">achievement</span> to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.
