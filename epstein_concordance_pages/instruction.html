The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment. Similarly, Maxwell argues that this\ntestimony resulted in a prejudicial variance from the Indictment.

The\nperjury counts likely implicate the performance and\ncredibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of\nwhom represent her in this case. The New York Rules\nof Professional Conduct generally forbid a lawyer from\nrepresenting a client in a proceeding in which the\nlawyer is likely also to be a witness. N.Y. R. Prof’l\nConduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action\nand the deposition may be important fact witnesses on\nthe perjury counts. Even if counsel were not required\nto testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell\nto choose between having her counsel testify on her\nbehalf on the perjury charges and having them assist\nher in defending the Mann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that witness\ntestimony offered by a party’s atorney presents\nserious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v.\nMetro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73, l78 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\nThe lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun\ncredibility, jurors might perceive the lawyer as dis-\ntorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred\nlines between argument and evidence might confuse\nthe jury.

(“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this leter motion :\nto intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially |\nopposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case, 2\nfiled as Docket No. 6l. ,\nMSW Media (htps://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about |\nfederal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It\nclearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.\nMSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the follouing reason. On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of ail\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No, 2o-33o (S.D.N.Y.). We\nare concerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #6l at 2 (emphasis added).)\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personaily identifiable information,\nsuch as information about the former defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while\nwe join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make\nthis narrou independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of\nwithholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this\nFOIA request if necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000776.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document l-l, o7/23/2ol9, 26l4667, Page2 of 2\nAn atorney and any pro se party who is permited to file documents electronically in CM/ECF\nmust notify the Court of a change to the user's mailing address, business address, telephone\nnumber, or e-mail.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo Filed o7/o7/2o Page 2 of 4\narriving at the courthouse.

This Opinion is provided pursuant to instructions from Peters and Peters Solicitors LLP’ dated l2\nAugust 2o2o in the context of bail proceedings relating to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell before the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York. Subsequent instructions have confirmed that Ms\nMaxwell will execute a waiver of her right to extradition that could be exhibited to a future extradition\nrequest made by the United States and relied upon in any extradition proceedings. The specific\nquestions asked by Peters and Peters are atached at Annex A. A summary of counsel’s relevant\nexperience is atached at Annex B. The waiver is atached at Annex C.\n\n2. Insummary:\n\n(a) Extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom are governed by the Extradition Act 2oo3\n(‘the 2oo3 Act’) and, in general, comprise; (i) a hearing before a designated ‘appropriate\nJudge’ (the extradition hearing); and (i) an appeal, subject to a leave requirement.\n\n(b) In proceedings under the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may consent to their extradition\nwhich has the effect of removing the need for an extradition hearing and waiving the\nperson’s statutory appeal rights.\n\n(c) In the majority of cases, proceedings in England and Wales in relation to US extradition\nrequests are concluded in under two years’. The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a transcript of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Detention dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 9 of 29\n\nIn three of the five cases the applicant was either a British citizen or had significant community and\n\nfamily ties to the UK”! but these were outweighed by the risk of flight, and in the other case, the lack of\n\nsubstantial community ties was cited as a factor in refusing bail”.\n\n23. As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD. The bars to extradition that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face extradition to\n\nthe US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n24. The offences in the superseding indictment are extradition offences within the meaning of section l37\n\nof the Extradition Act 2oo3”.\n\n25.

By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002337.jpg": "__ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l29 Filed o2/ol/2l Page l of 2\nU.S. Department of Justice\nees United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002375.jpg": "GeaSell2 sce MOFABARW SP COURIRREABE2] FilKedORzOHS!

Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003101.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 239\nin a bankruptcy proceeding). Similarly, “[c]ourts have repeatedly recognized the appropriateness\nof trying perjury or obstruction charges together with the underlying crimes to which the perjury\nrelates, where proof of the alleged perjury requires proof of knouledge of the underlying crime.”\nUnited States v. Butler, No. o4 Cr. 34o, 2oo4 WL 227475l, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 2oo4) (Lynch,\nJ.) (permiting joinder of defendants under Rule 8(b)).\n\nIn the event that properly joined counts “appear[] to prejudice a defendant or the\ngovernment,” Rule l4(a) permits a court to “order separate trials of counts . . . or provide any other\nrelief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a). “[I]n order to prevail” on a Rule l4 motion,\n“the defendant must shou not simply some prejudice but substantial prejudice.” United States v.\nSampson, 385 F.3d l83, l9o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Werner, 62o F.2d at 928). The defendant\ncarries this “heavy burden” because Rule 8(a) already strikes a “balance” between “considerations\nof economy and speed” and “possible unfairness” to the defendant. United States v. Amato, l5\nF.3d 23o, 237 (2d Cir. l994). Accordingly, “the principles that guide the district court’s\nconsideration of a motion for severance usually counsel denial,” Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at\n*5 (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citation omited), and severance should be granted\n“only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the\ndefendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence,” Zafiro\nv. United States, 5o6 U.S. 534, 539 (l993).°* But “Rule l4 does not require severance even if\nprejudice is shoun; rather, it leaves the tailoring of the relief to be granted, if any, to the district\ncourt’s sound discretion.” /d. at 538-39. “[L]ess drastic measures . . . such as limiting instructions,\n2 While Zafiro involved a motion to sever defendants, rather than counts, the Supreme Court’s\nconstruction of Rule l4(a) applies in either case. See Page, 657 F.3d at l29 (relying on Zafiro);\nUnited States v. Gracesqui, No. lo Cr. 74 (PKC), 2ol5 WL 523ll68, at *4 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8,\n2ol5), aff'd, 73o F. App’x 25 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (citing Page for the proposition that Zafiro applies\nboth to motions to sever counts and motions to sever defendants).\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 239\n\nas to those counts, and would consent to a similar limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, which a jury would be\npresumed to follou. And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the\ndefendant would surely argue that a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is necessary to prevent the jury from\nconcluding that the defendant’s statements were false based in part on the substance of Giuffre’s\nunproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for that\npurpose, so can the jury set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for Counts One through\nFour.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a “collateral trial” on the\ntruth of Giuffre’s statements and resolution of “more than 5o substantive motions . . . pending\nbefore the District Court.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-lo). As described in Section V, a false statement in\na civil deposition is material (l) if a “truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit,” United States v. Kross, l4\nF.3d 75l, 753 (2d Cir. l994), or (2) if it has “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,” United States v.\nGaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omited).\nNeither of these standards requires the jury to determine whether the defendant’s statements would\nhave tipped the scales in the defamation suit or would likely have led to the discovery of evidence.\nSee Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 77l (l988) (“It has never been the test of materiality\nthat the misrepresentation or concealment would more likely than not have produced an erroneous\ndecision, or even that it would more likely than not have triggered an investigation.”); United States\nv. An Antique Plater of Gold, l84 F.3d l3l, l35-36 (2d Cir. l999) (distinguishing the “natural\ntendency test” from a but-for test); Kross, l4 F.3d at 754 (rejecting, in a civil forfeiture case, the\nargument that the defendant’s true testimony would not itself have justified a forfeiture because\n\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 239\n“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”). The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y.

Co., 583 F.3d\nl73, l77-8o (2d Cir. 2oo9) (discussing the advocate-witness rule).\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3llo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 239\npublic, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 239\nAccordingly, overt acts that may, on their oun, be untimely can nevertheless serve as direct\nevidence of the existence of a charged conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 43 (2d Cir. 2olo) (declining to vacate\na conviction on a statute with only prospective application when “the Government presented post-\nenactment evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements” in addition to evidence of relevant pre-\nenactment conduct). Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia. See id. at 33. As such, this motion\ndoes not offer a basis for a bill of particulars.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 239\nthe Court informing the jury that, to convict on any conspiracy count, it must find at least one overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute of limitations. See Benussi,\n2l6 F. Supp. 2d at 3o9 (describing a similar jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> provided for a conspiracy containing\nsome allegations that were time-barred and others that were timely).\n\nSecond, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. The references to “sexual abuse” accurately describe Minor Victim-3’s experience of\nsex acts with Epstein as traumatic, exploitative, and abusive, and she will testify to that effect at\ntrial. Moreover, because these acts were commited in furtherance of the criminal conspiracies\ncharged in the Indictment, it is neither misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity\ninvolved illegal conduct. More to the point, because evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 “‘is\nadmissible and relevant to the charge[s]” contained in Counts One and Three of the Indictment,\nthe language describing Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment “may not be stricken”\n“regardless of hou prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d at lol3 (quoting DePalma,\n46l F. Supp. at 797).\n\nFinally, even if Minor Victim-3’s experiences did not constitute direct evidence of the\ncrimes charged—which they do—this same evidence will also be admissible pursuant to Rule\n4o4(b) to prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nEvidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove\na person’s character in order to shou that on a particular occasion\nthe person acted in accordance with the character. This evidence\nmay be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence\nof mistake, or lack of accident.\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 239\n4o4(b)(2); (i) is relevant to the crime for which the defendant is on trial; (ll) has probative value\nthat is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudicial effect; and (iv) is admited with a\nlimiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to the jury, if requested. See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 68l, 69l-\n92 (l988); United States v. LaFlam, 369 F.3d l53, l56 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nHere, evidence regarding the defendant’s interactions with Minor Victim-3 is admissible\nto prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi, all of which are permissible\npurposes under Rule 4o4(b). Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used massage to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The similarity sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l9 of 239\n\nSeventh, the defendant seeks a proffer of all co-conspirator statements that the Government\nintends to offer at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E). (Def. Mot. lo at l3-\nl4). In making this motion, the defense cites authority confirming that co-conspirator statements\nmay be admited at trial on a conditional basis without the need for any pretrial consideration of\ntheir admissibility. See United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993) (“The decision\nas to whether the four prerequisites have been met, like all other preliminary questions of\nadmissibility, is to be made by the court. If the government succeeds in persuading the court that\nthe conditionally admited coconspirator statements were made during and in furtherance of a\nconspiracy of which both the declarant and the defendant were members, the statements are\nalloued to go to the jury. If the court is not so persuaded, it either should instruct the jury to\ndisregard the statements, or, if those statements were ‘so large a proportion of the proof as to render\na cautionary <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> of doubtful utility,’ should declare a mistrial.” (internal citations omited)\n(quoting United States v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969))). Indeed, the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87\n(2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s order directing the\nGovernment “to produce all oral statement made by the defendants and coconspirators that the\nGovernment planned to offer at trial as admissions of a defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol).\nConsistent with the Government’s intention to produce Jencks Act material several weeks in\nadvance of trial, the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator statements that the\nGovernment may seek to introduce through witness statements with sufficient time to raise any\nobjections with the Court. Accordingly, this motion should be denied\n\nl92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez.

Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\n\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\n2, That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3. Try to work it out.\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what\nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact\nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make\nit less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.

THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*\"? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.7! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater.

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”**! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 258 of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list. Villafafia recalled\nthat Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy\nthe list afterwards. Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”>°?\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”3>*\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”* In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

[I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case.

The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial.

There is no proper purpose for the\nadmission of any of the alleged perjury which occurred decades after the charges in Counts l-4. Certainly,\nthe government has articulated none. Ms. Maxwell’s answers to the vague and objectionable questions\nselectively plucked from hundreds of pages of transcripts have no relevance to any material issue related\nto the Mann Act Counts.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense.

Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\n\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\nDe That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3. Try to work it out.\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what\nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact\nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make\nit less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9l of 349\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 224 of 349\neaten, U.S. Department of Fustice\ngrate Federal Burcau of Investigation\nay FBI - West Palm Beach\nree cey Suite 5oo\noa 3o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) 833-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 278, 2oo6\nRe: Case Number: a\na\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Programas being a possible victim of a federal ‘\ncrime.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 259 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list. Villafafia recalled\nthat Reiter told her that he would “try to contact as many as he could” and that he would destroy\nthe list afterwards. Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\nidentified and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”°>?\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”°\"4\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”**° In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-identified victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing. Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n453 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n334 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n2o8 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.

In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 292 of 349\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the conclusion of a second jury trial, Cosby was convicted on all three counts of\naggravated indecent assault. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l.

(quoting Commonwealth v. Aikens, 99o A.2d ll8l, ll85 (Pa.\nSuper. 2olo)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d. (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)(2)). Moreover, Cosby’s\n“knouledge of the use of central nervous system depressants, coupled with his likely past\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 44 of 8o\nuse of the same with the [prior bad acts] witnesses, were essential to resolving the\notherwise he-said-she-said nature of [Constand’s] allegations.” /d. The Superior Court\nadded that the trial court did not err in determining that the probative value of this evidence\noutweighed its potential for unfair prejudice, inasmuch as, “in a vacuum, Cosby’s use and\ndistribution of a then-legal ‘party drug’ nearly half a century ago did not appear highly\nprejudicial,” and “only becomes significantly prejudicial, and fairly so, when, in the context\nof other evidence, it establishes Cosby's knouledge of and familiarity with central nervous\nsystem depressants for purposes of demonstrating that he was at least reckless” in giving\nConstand such a drug before having sexual contact with her. /d. at 42o-2l (emphasis in\noriginal) (cleaned up). The court added that any potential for unfair prejudice was\nmitigated substantially by the court’s cautionary instructions, and that, accordingly, there\nwas no error in the admission of this evidence. /d. at 42l.\n\nTurning to Cosby’s claims relating to the enforceability of the non-prosecution or\nimmunity decision rendered by then-District Atorney Castor, the Superior Court viewed\nthis as a challenge to the denial of a motion to quash a criminal complaint, which would\nbe evaluated under an abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 4lo. Like the trial court, the\npanel found no “authority suggesting that a district atorney ‘may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. at 4ll (quoting\nT.C.O. at 62). Therefore, the court opined, “it is clear on the face of the record that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was no enforceable non-\nprosecution agreement in this case.” /d. The court added: “Even assuming Mr. Castor\npromised not to prosecute [Cosby], only a court order can convey such immunity. Such\npromises exist only as exercises of prosecutorial discretion, and may be revoked at any\ntime.” /d. The court discussed the immunity statute and observed that it provides that “a\ndistrict atorney may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 47 of 8o\nThe decisions belou, barring prosecution of the Stipetiches, embodied\nconcern that allouing charges to be brought after George Stipetich had\nperformed his part of the agreement by answering questions about sources\nof the contraband discovered in his residence would be fundamentally unfair\nbecause in answering the questions he may have disclosed information that\ncould be used against him. The proper response to this concern is not to\nbar prosecution; rather, it is to suppress, at the appropriate juncture, any\ndetrimental evidence procured through the inaccurate representation that\nhe would not be prosecuted.\n\nId. at l296. Although the Superior Court dismissed this passage from Stipetich as dicta,\nit found the situation distinguishable in any event inasmuch as former D.A. Castor testified\nthat there was no “agreement” or “quid pro quo” with Cosby, and, therefore, any reliance\nthat Cosby placed upon the district atorney's promise was unreasonable. Cosby, 224\nA.3d at 4l6-l7.\n\nThe Superior Court concluded that it was bound by the trial court’s factual findings\nand by its credibility determinations. The trial court had “determined that Mr. Castor’s\ntestimony and, by implication, Atorney Schmit’s testimony (which was premised upon\ninformation he indirectly received from Mr. Castor) were not credible.” /d. at 4l7. The\npanel added that the trial court had “found that the weight of the evidence supported its\nfinding that no agreement or grant of immunity was made, and that [Cosby] did not\nreasonably rely on any overtures by Mr. Castor to that effect when he sat for his civil\ndeposition.” /d. Thus, the Superior Court discerned no error in the trial court’s decision\nto allou the use of Cosby’s deposition testimony against him at trial.'®\nng In addition to the Rule 4o4(b) and non-prosecutions claims, the Superior Court\nrejected a number of other issues raised by Cosby, including an assertion of improper\njuror bias, a challenge to an allegedly misleading jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, and a contention that\nSORNA was unconstitutional.

Publicizing their names will subject them to unwanted atention at the time they\nare testifying in a criminal sex abuse trial.‘\n\nTaken together, requiring the Minor Victims to testify under their true and full names\nimposes serious costs on them. It is inconsistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act’s\nexhortation that victims are to be treated with respect for their “dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8).

It could also cause other victims—including minors—to avoid seeking help from law\nenforcement because of fear that coming forward could subject them to further harassment and\nembarrassment. Cf Fed.

Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 4o\n\nFinally, the defense argues that this motion is purely tactical on the part of the Government,\nbecause this motion affords sympathy to the victims. (Def. Opp. at 22). Remarkably—and\nunfortunately—the defense again repeats their claim that testimony is being fabricated. (/d.). The\nGovernment is responding to the real concerns of its victims, as it is duty-bound to do, and as is\ncommon in cases involving sexual abuse. It has also already agreed to a jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, as is\nsometimes given in these cases, explaining that the use of pseudonyms and first names should not\nbe held against the defendant. (See Gov’t Mot. at l4 n.4). If any tactical gamesmanship is\noccurring, it is on the part of the defense, which spends a few paragraphs out of nearly twenty\npages of their brief offering conclusory reasons why privacy safeguards undermine a defense\ninterest. As the defense is well aware, such safeguards are significant to the Minor Victims and\ntheir willingness to testify. But the Court need not arbitrate issues of litigation tactics. The balance\nof interests on this issue is clear and weighs in favor of privacy safeguards, as it did in many other\ntrials involving sex crimes.\n\nE. Sealing Related Exhibits is Entirely Appropriate\n\nJust as the Government’s proposal is narrouly tailored with respect to the defendant, so it\nis narrouly tailored with respect to the right of the public and the press to access the trial. The\npublic and press are free to atend the entire trial. They may observe each of the Minor Victims,\nin person, testify in full. At no point during testimony is the Government seeking closure of the\ncourtroom. The public and the press are also welcome to see most of the trial exhibits.\n\nThe only narrou exception is for those exhibits that specifically contain identifying\ninformation of Minor Victims. As the Court is well aware, the right to access trial evidence is not\nabsolute, and it can be overcome—especially by information that is “traditionally considered\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005616.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 7 ofl2\nARGUMENT\nI.

In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell\nrespectfully moves (l) to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as\na “minor” or asserting that she was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) to preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey\nEpstein, and (3) for an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> concerning Accuser-3’s testimony.\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe government and the defense agree on at least this much about Accuser-3:\nl. She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\nconspiracy to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n! This individual is described in the S2 Superseding Indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the\nindividuals identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2,\nrespectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005673.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person’s character in order to shou that on\n\na particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\n\ncharacter.\n\n(2) Permited Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(l)-(2). For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\nS\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5673\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005674.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pageloof2l\nprejudice pursuant to Rule 4o3; in addition, (4) at defendant’s request, the district court should\ngive the jury an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.

R. Evid. 4o4(b)).\n\nWhen the government must prove a conspiracy charge, evidence of other acts commited\n“in furtherance of the conspiracy” is not “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b), but rather, it is\ndirect evidence of the acts charged in the Indictment. United States v. Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR.\n34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Concepcion,\n983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992)). Houever, “other acts” are only admissible as evidence of a\nconspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.” United States v. Cummings,\n6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)).\n\nEvidence of uncharged conduct is not considered other act evidence under Rule 4o4(b)\n“if it [l] arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, [2] if it\nis inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense, or [3] if it is\nnecessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d\n367, 37o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (quoting United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo)).\nHouever, “where it is not manifestly clear that the evidence in question is intrinsic proof of the\ncharged crime, the proper course is to proceed under Rule 4o4(b).” Tounsend, 2oo7 WL\nl288597, at *l (citing Nektalov, 325 F.

Such a rule would allou the government to entirely circumvent Rule 4o4(b)\nsimply by charging other act conduct in the indictment.\n\nMoreover, without a proper limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, there is a serious risk that the jury will\nview this lawful conduct as evidence of criminal propensity. See United States v. Dolney, No.\no4-CR-l59 (NGG), 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (E.D.N-Y. Sept. l, 2oo5) (benefit of applying Rule\n4o4(b) is “the value that a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> will have in ensuring that the jury does not view\nthe defendants’ alleged prior conduct as evidence of the defendants’ propensity to engage in\ncriminal activity”). At the very least, it is not “manifestly clear” that the evidence related to\nAccuser-3 is proof of the charged Mann Act conspiracies. Accordingly, “the proper course is to\nproceed under Rule 4o4(b).” Tounsend, 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l (citing Nektalov, 325 F. Supp.\n2d at 372).\n\nIll. Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Admissible Under Rule 4o4(b) and Should be\n\nExcluded Under Rule 4o3\n\nThe Court should also not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 as Rule 4o4(b) evidence\nbecause it will be offered solely to shou Ms. Maxwell’s criminal propensity and will be unfairly\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5678\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005681.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 2l\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo568l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV.

Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8S. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (‘Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005683.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9of 2l\nactivity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>,\nthere exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5683\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2oof2l\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence related to Accuser-3\nbecause it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and\nRule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

The Government Should Not Be Permited to Introduce Evidence of Alleged\n“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After Epstein’s Death Is Proof of\nConsciousness of Guilt\nThe government cannot establish a satisfactory factual predicate for the jury to infer that\n\nMs. Maxwell was, in fact, fleeing or evading law enforcement authorities after the arrest of\n\nJeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct is proof of consciousness of guilt. The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys. As previously discussed,\n\nMs. Maxwell also addressed and rebuted each point that the government referenced in its bail\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5696\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 Filed lo/29/2l Page5oflil\nId. at 24 (citing United States v.

The Court did not\nbelieve that a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would be adequate to mitigate the risk of prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell. /d.\n\nThe Court further found that any consideration of the perjury charges would likely\nrequire disqualification of at least one of her atorneys in the criminal case, two of whom had\nrepresented her at the civil depositions, which would significantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of\n\nat least one of Maxwell’s atorneys from participating as an\n\nadvocate on her behalf..... Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action\n\nand the deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury\n\ncounts.

Finally, the Court noted that much of the proof relevant\nto the perjury counts was beyond the scope of the “narrouer issues” presented by the other\ncharges, that the perjury counts involved legal and factual questions were “unlikely to bear on\nthe other charges,” and that addressing the perjury counts would involve a “significant\ninvestment of time and resources” that would impair the efficiency of the trial. /d. at 25-26. For\nthese reasons, the Court found that Ms. Maxwell had shoun “significant unfairness” that\noutweighed the burden of conducting separate trials and severed the perjury counts. /d. at 23, 26.\n\nAccordingly, the government will not be alloued to introduce at trial evidence of any\nalleged false deposition statements by Ms. Maxwell as evidence of the perjury counts.

Discussion\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is direct evidence of the charged criminal conduct—\nspecifically, the conspiracies in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. | —sidz\nee\nee\nae. The Government expects that Minor Victim-3’s testimony, which concerns a\nperiod of time overlapping with or in close proximity to other Minor Victims’ experiences with\nthe defendant and Epstein and concerns teenagers of similar ages, will significantly overlap with\nthe testimony of those other Minor Victims. Put simply, Minor Victim-3’s account is\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 54 of 84\nwith Epstein. When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> about United Kingdom law. The defense has\ndemonstrated no unfair prejudice that might warrant a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, and the defense’s\nproposed instructions would only confuse the jury. The jury will be instructed to consider only\n\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 55 of 84\nthe elements of the crimes the Court provides them, so any assumptions the jury might make about\nUnited Kingdom law are irrelevant.!4 See United States v. Vasquez, 82 F.3d 574, 577 (2d Cir.\nl996) (appropriate to reject defense request for an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> if it does not “represent[] a theory\nof the defense with a basis in the record that would lead to acquital”). And the proposed jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 “cannot be considered ‘illegal’ or\n‘criminal’ or ‘unlawful’ for purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment” (Def. Mot. 4 at l5),\nis wrong on the law. The sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of the defendant’s\nguilt of those crimes. The <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the defense proposes, in contrast, creates serious risk that\nthe jury will think the Court is telling them that the conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to\nthe case. It is not irrelevant: it is direct evidence of the crimes charged, and it should be put before\nthe jury.\nIV. There is No Basis to Preclude Co-Conspirator Statements at Trial\n\nOn October ll, the Government provided the defense with comprehensive Jencks Act\nmaterial for trial witnesses and its exhibits, along with a leter telling the defense, consistent with\nthe Court’s order, the identities of the individuals the Government intends to argue are co-\nconspirators at trial. The defense nonetheless asks the Court to enter an order precluding the\nGovernment from introducing any co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence\n‘4 Tn the event the Court instructs the jury on the age of consent in the United Kingdom, the\nGovernment requests that the Court also instruct the jury that the United Kingdom’s age of consent\nis irrelevant and they should not consider it.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 56 of 84\n8o2(d)(2)(E) because it claims the Government failed to comply with the Court’s September 3,\n2o2l Order. (Def. Mot. l at l). The defense misreads this Court’s September 3, 2o2l Order to\nrequire the Government to do something unprecedented: identify and itemize for the defense each\nand every co-conspirator statement it plans to use at trial, seven weeks in advance of trial. Then,\ncomplaining that the Government has not complied with the defense’s peculiar reading, the\ndefense seeks an extraordinary remedy: precluding the Government from offering any co-\nconspirator statements at trial. Each step of this analysis is erroneous, and the Court should deny\nthe motion.\n\nA. Background\n\nThe defendant first sought to compel the Government to identify the co-conspirator\nstatements it plans to use at trial in its initial round of pretrial motions. There, the defendant argued\nthat the Second Circuit’s practice of conditional admission of co-conspirator statements at trial\nwould prejudice her because “any cautionary <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would be of doubtful utility.” (Mem. of\nLaw at l3, Dkt. No. l48). She therefore asked the Court to order a “proffer from the government\nor conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.” (/d. at l3-l4).\n\nIn response, the Government observed that the practice of conditional admission of co-\nconspirator statements is the law of the Circuit, notwithstanding the defense’s preference to the\ncontrary. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4). The Government also explained that “the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.” (/d.). See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283,\n284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s order directing the\nGovernment to “produce all oral statements made by the defendants and coconspirators that the\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act production—\nand specifically, the Government’s production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5846\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 79 of 84\ncredibility.”). Prosecutors are simply using a term that is consistent with the Government’s theory\nof the case. See United States v. Edwards, No. CR l6-lo3-BLG-SPW-l, 2ol7 WL 4l59365, at\n*l (D. Mont. Sept. l9, 2ol7) (explaining that “use of the term ‘victim’ is not prejudicial to the\ndefendant’s rights when the presentation of evidence taken as a whole clarifies the government’s\nburden of proving all of the elements of the crime” and finding that the “jury will not be unduly\nprejudiced against [the defendant] if the government refers to certain witnesses as victims’); (citing\nUnited States v. Washburn, 444 F.3d loo7, lol3 (8th Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] number of courts have\ndetermined that the use of the term “victim” in jury instructions is not prejudicial to a defendant’s\nrights when, as is the case here, the instructions taken as a whole clarify the government’s burden\nof proving all elements of the crime”)); Server v. Mizell, 9o2 F.2d 6ll, 6l5 (7th Cir. l99o) (“No\nlogical argument can be made that the mere use of the term ‘victim’ [in jury instructions] somehou\nshifted the burden of proof.”). In addition, “[t]he term ‘victim’ is not inherently prejudicial. It is\na term commonly used in the English language that does not by its nature connote guilt.” United\nStates v. Lussier, No. l8-CR-28l (NEB), 2ol9 WL 24899o6, at *5 (D. Minn. June l5, 2ol9).7!\nAnd just as the defense may make arguments atacking the credibility of victims, the Government\nis free to argue that these witnesses are, in fact, victims of a crime. Cf United States v. Thai, 29\nF.3d 785, 8o7 (2d Cir. l994) (explaining that prosecutors may also “respond to an argument that\nimpugns its integrity or the integrity of its case’’).\n\n7l The same is true with references by the Government to “minor victims.” (Cf Def. Mot. l2 at 4-\n5).

As this Court previously has\nruled:\n\n\"To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\n\n‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence\n\nand jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that\n\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an\n\noffense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y.

Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7.

The Court should therefore\nexclude evidence related to qq or, if it is admited, give the jury the requested\nlimiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.’\n\nThe government advances four principal arguments for why evidence related to yy\nME should be admited as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies: (l) her testimony\nallegedly shous a “patern” of hou Epstein and Ms. Maxwell sexually abused young women and\nestablishes Ms. Maxwell’s “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies (Resp. at 45-46),\n(2) her allegations are included in the S2 Indictment and are therefore not covered by Rule\n\n’ As it pertains to | and the other accusers, the defense will be submiting\nproposed jury instructions and special verdict findings.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 52\n\nThe very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the conspiracy. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a conspiracy because Curley was not charged with a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of interstate violation of\na protection order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\nconspiracy. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47. But as the defense pointed out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as\nevidence of a conspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.’ United States\nv. Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4), vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763\n(2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)). The\ngovernment has not explained why gg evidence provides any proof that Ms.\nMaxwell “furthered” an alleged conspiracy to cause minors (she did not) to travel (she did not)\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally irrelevant that\nOO —“SCSCSCSCSCies\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005989.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 52\nDn. 2 id. at 49-5o. According to\nthe government, “all that is required” for ME evidence to be admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies is that she was under the age of l8, the age of consent\nunder U.S. federal law, and that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein intended to engage in sexual\ncontact with her. See id.\n\nIt is the government, not the defense, that apparently does not understand the law. The\nMann Act conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment each require proof that Ms. Maxwell acted\nwith the intent that the alleged victim would “engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. ¥f| l2 (citing l8 U.S.C. § 2422), l8 (citing l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). That element incorporates offenses under state law. See United States v. Lincoln, No.\nl9-CR-6o47 (CJS), 2ol9 WL 7l9822, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2ol9) (collecting § 2422 cases);\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 735 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (criminal sexual\nactivity under § 2423 includes crimes “under federal, state, or foreign law’). Indeed, the Mann\nAct conspiracies in the S2 Indictment charge a violation of a New York State misdemeanor as\nthe “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. § l3b,\nl9b (citing N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55). Section l3o.55 prohibits “subject[ing] another person to\nsexual contact without the later’s consent.” N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. To be guilty of Section\nl3o.55 based on the victim’s incapacity to consent due to age, the victim must be under the age\nof l7. Id. § l3o.o5(3)(a). The government itself acknouledged this in its draft proposed jury\ninstructions, as well as the fact that Ms. Maxwell cannot be convicted of the Mann Act\nconspiracies unless she knew that the alleged victim was under l7. See Gov’t Proposed Jury\nInstructions (“[I]n order to find that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of52\nvictim’s age, you must find that the defendant knew that the victim was less than seventeen years\nold.”) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is unclear whether the government is nou claiming that to adm\nevidence as proof of the Mann Act conspiracies, it only needs to prove that\nwas under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged abuse and that Ms. Maxwell did not need to\nknou anything about I age, or that Ms. Maxwell only needed to knou that yy\nME «2s under the age of l8. Either one is a misstatement of the law. For “sexual\nactivity” to be “criminal,” it must be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction where the sex acts\nallegedly took place. If those crimes are based on lack of consent due to age, it is only illegal if\nthe alleged victim is under the age of consent in that jurisdiction. And according to the\ngovernment’s oun proposed jury instructions, Ms. Maxwell can only be found guilty of the\nMann Act conspiracies if she knew |] (and the other alleged victims) were under\nthe age of consent in the particular jurisdictions where the sex acts allegedly took place. Because\nBE 2s, at all times, over the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, her\nevidence is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and is therefore not admissible as\ndirect evidence. At the very least, because it is not “manifestly clear” that\nevidence is proof of the charged conspiracies, “the proper course is to proceed under Rule\n4o4(b).” United States v. Tounsend, No. 8l o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d 367, 372 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4)).\n\n <Vidence should also be excluded under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3.\nAs argued in our initial Motion, evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly encouraged an adult to\nengage in legal sexual activity is not, in any way, evidence of her intent to facilitate Epstein’s\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo599o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 52\nalleged scheme to cause minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, or her knouledge of the\nsame. See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “irrelevant” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo599l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 52\nactivity for which the defendant could be charged with specific New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New\nYork, and Canadian criminal offenses” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, the Court should give\nthe jury the defense’s requested limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.®\n\nV. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER EVIDENCE\n\nOF MS. MAXWELL’S ALLEGED “FLIGHT”\n\nThe government has conceded that it will not elicit any evidence or argue to the jury that\nMs. Maxwell “was hiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s\narrest and her oun.” Resp. at 8l-82.\n\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER\n\nEVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL’S ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nAND AGREES TO MS.

United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching.

Thank you again for your time and service. As I\n\n6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I\n\n7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the\n\n8 first step in the jury selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrou if\nll necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process.\nl2 That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process\nl3. today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\nl4 As you knou from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today\nl5 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As\nl6 you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl7. aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl8 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\nl9 ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent,\n2o and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has\n2l. proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n22) Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal\n23 ~~ case is a critical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who\n24 ~—can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. Some people find that they can be fair and\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o4 _ Filed ll/o2/2l Page4of6\n\nl there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record,\n\n2 please let me knou. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue\n\n3. to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process.\n\n4 Nou, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to\n\n5 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to\n\n6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.\n\n7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here nou, she's presumed to be innocent. She is\n\n8 presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n9 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nlo anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\nll can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with\nl2 commiting these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government\nl3. can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not\nl4 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on\nl5 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.\nl6 The next thing is that as jurors you must follou the law as I give it to you, even if you\nl7. don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.\nl8 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in\nl9 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in\n2o ~~ discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on\n2l +something that you might have read or heard about another case.\n22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not\n23 permited to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o4 _ Filed ll/o2/2l Page5of6\n\nl of this case at all. If you see something in the paper or online, you're just going to have to turn\n\n2 the page or close the brouser. You can't read it.\n\n3 Equally important, you're not permited to discuss this case with anyone else while the\n\n4 case is going on. Even with your fellou jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard all\n\n5 the evidence and I’ve given my instructions on the law. Again, that's because you can only\n\n6 consider the evidence that you hear in the courtroom, not anything outside of the courtroom. You\n\n7 have to keep an open mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your\n\n8 jury service is complete. You can tell them that you are a juror in a criminal case in federal court\n\n9 and that the judge has told you that you are not permited to say anything further.\nlo Similarly, until you are excused from jury service, you cannot post anything about your\nll experience as a juror on Facebook, Twiter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of social media.\nl2 Another <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, you can't look up or google or do any other kind of search about anything\nl3. related to the case or anyone involved in the case.\nl4 The reason for these rules, as I am sure you understand, is they protect the integrity of the\nl5 trial and assure that both sides receive a fair trial.\nl6 Jurors in criminal cases base their verdicts on the evidence that they hear in the\nl7. courtroom, not on something that somebody else tells you, not on something that you see on TV\nl8 or on social media. That's why if you're selected as a juror, I'll be reminding you of these rules\nl9 regularly. You can't watch news accounts, look anything up or speak to anybody else about the\n2o case.

You, the\nmembers of the jury, are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts.

You should bear in mind particularly that questions\nput to witnesses, although they can provide the context to answers, are not themselves evidence.\nIt is only the answers that are evidence.\n\nI remind you also that nothing I have said during the trial or will say during these\ninstructions is evidence.

One type of\nevidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct evidence is a witness’s testimony about\nsomething that the witness knous by virtue of his or her oun senses—something that the witness\nhas seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\nThe other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\nevidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\ncircumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\n\nAssume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nwas a nice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nyou cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\ndripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\n\nNou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nraining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nhave asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that between\nthe time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\n\nThat is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\ncommon sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n\nMany facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\nevidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\nthat the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\nthat, before convicting each defendantMs. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied ofeach-\n\ndefendants her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 65 of 93\nInferences\n\nDuring the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\nterm “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\nbased on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\nexistence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\ninvolves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\nWhat is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\nsuspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\nbased on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\n\nThere are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\ndirect or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nthe defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nwill draw.\n\nThe process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nspeculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nrequired to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nevidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\n\nTherefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nthe facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\nyour experience.\n\nSome inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that the-defendantMs.\n\nMaxwell is guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at\nthe time the crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.

The most important\npart of this case, members of the jury, is the part that you as jurors are nou about to play as you\ndeliberate on the issues of fact. It is for you, and you alone, to weigh the evidence in this case\nand determine whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the\nessential elements of the crime with which each-DefendantMs. Maxwell is charged. If the\nGovernment has succeeded, your verdict should be guilty as to that DefendantMs. Maxwell and\nthat charge; if it has failed, your verdict should be not guilty as to that DefendantMs. Maxwell\nand that charge.\n\nYou must base your verdict solely on the evidence or lack of evidence and these\ninstructions as to the law, and you are obliged under your oath as jurors to follou the law as I\nhave instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the particular law in question.\n\nUnder your oath as jurors, you are not to be swayed by sympathy. You should be guided\nsolely be the evidence presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you, without regard\nto the consequences of your decision. You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a\nverdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your\nclear thinking, there is a risk that you will not arrive at a just verdict.\n\nAs you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellou jurors, and ask for an\nopportunity to express your oun views. Every juror should be heard. No one juror should hold\ncenter stage in the jury room and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations.\nIf, after listening to your fellou jurors and if, after stating your oun view, you become\nconvinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change\nyour view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely\nbecause of the opinions of your fellou jurors or because you are outnumbered.

See Yousef, 327 F.3d at l48. The Government\nagrees that at least one of these opinions can meet this test: it is “within the range where experts\nmight reasonably differ,” Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at l53, and can be tested through “[v]igorous\ncross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on the burden of\nproof.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 596. Specifically, the Government agrees that Dr. Dietz can respond\nto Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about grooming behaviors by suggesting that grooming does not have\none setled definition. See 2/25/2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:l4, United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.)

But this commonplace truth does not need\ntestimony from a psychiatric expert.\n\nThe concept of hindsight bias is well within the ken of the average juror. “Hindsight bias\nis a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’” Adams v. Lab. Corp. of\nAm., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). The prevalence of this common saying shous that\njurors plainly understand the ways in which hindsight can bias one’s perspective. As such, expert\ntestimony on it is unnecessary and inappropriate. See id. (“[C]ommon-sense concepts are\nespecially appropriate for consideration by a jury.”); see also, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273\nF.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that is directed solely\nto lay maters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited)). To whatever extent the Court believes further\nemphasis on this point is helpful, it can give the jury appropriate and neutral instructions to guide\nits deliberations. What the defense cannot do is skew the jury’s deliberations by puting an expert\nimprimatur on testimony that states, in effect, that the jurors should second-guess their assessments\nof the evidence because they are subject to hindsight bias. This inversion of the courtroom roles—\nin which a party’s witness sits in judgment of the jurors—is prejudicial and usurps the function\nboth of the jurors and of the Court in instructing the jury. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364\n(“Whereas an expert may be uniquely qualified by experience to assist the trier of fact, he is not\nqualified to compete with the judge in the function of instructing the jury.”).\n\nIf Dr. Dietz’s testimony on hindsight bias is helpful to the jury in this case, testimony of\nthis sort would become central to the court system. Every single trial involves a retrospective\nadjudication. The bulk of trials—civil and criminal—involve an assessment of a party’s\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 26 of 4l\ncreates a predicate that a witness has a condition creating such a “pathway.” And even then, as\ndescribed above, it is likely that such an opinion, based on one article, would be unreliable, only\nmarginally helpful to a jury that can understand the relationship between mental illness and truth-\ntelling, and highly prejudicial by having an expert witness testify to the credibility of other\nwitnesses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\nconfidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more difficult for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 38 of 4l\nis a tautology that someone who has a false memory—that is, unknouingly misremembers\nsomething—believes it to be accurate. Otherwise it would not be a memory.\n\n3. Opinions Bearing on Witness Credibility and Demeanor\n\nThe follouing opinions by Dr. Loftus invade the province of the jury by atempting to\ninstruct it on hou to assess witness credibility and demeanor:\n\ne Hou an individual with a false memory can describe that memory “with confidence, detail\nand emotion,” as described in Paragraph 5(a) above.\ne Hou an individual with a false memory is “not deliberately lying,” as described in\n\nParagraph 5(b) above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from opining on victim or witness credibility, including by\nopining as to hou a victim with an alleged false memory may testify (e.g., confidently) and\ndescribing a victim with an alleged false memory as a “liar” or “not a deliberate liar.’ Such\nopinions would be highly prejudicial and inflammatory, would confuse and mislead the jury, and\nwould invade the fundamental province of the jury in determining witness credibility. See\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d at 288-89 (affirming district court’s exclusion of expert testimony that a\nwitness’s confidence does not correlate to the witness’s factual accuracy in the context of an\nidentification because such testimony “might confuse or mislead the jury”); Shohola, 2ol9 WL\n6o53223, at *lo-l3 (discussing jury’s province of determining witness credibility); Fed. R. Evid.\n4o3. Such opinions, moreover, are effectively defense arguments to be appropriately made during\ndefense summations. To allou Dr. Loftus to testify that a victim is essentially a liar (but may not\nrealize she is a liar) or that a witness may testify confidently even when testifying untruthfully\nwould effectively allou the defense to cloak its arguments under the imprimatur of a purported\nexpert.

Thank you again for your time and service. As I\n\n6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I\n\n7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the\n\n8 first step in the jury selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return temerrew-an\nll additional day this week if necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and\nl2 final step in the process. That will take place on November 29.\nl3 In any event, after you complete this step of the process today, you will receive\nl4 instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\nl5 As you knou from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today\nl6 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As\nl7. you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl8 aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl9 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\n2o ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent,\n2l and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has\n22. + proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n23 Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal\n24 ~— case is acritical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page5ofl6\nl the case, and the information will not affect whether or not you are selected to serve as a juror in\n2 this case. Finally, the form will be destroyed at the conclusion of trial.\n\n3 To conduct the next phase of the process, I will ask each of you some questions\n\n4 individually. We’ll do that in a separate courtroom where I and the lawyers and the Defendant\n\n5 are siting nou. You all will be brought in the courtroom one at a time. Bear in mind that this is\n\n6 apublic courtroom. To protect your privacy, I will only refer to you by your juror number.\n\n7 Please do not state any identifying information. For example, if we talk about your job you\n\n8 could say that you are a sales clerk at a large retail store, without stating the specific name of\n\n9 your employer. This is to protect your privacy. Even with those privacy protections in place, if\nlo there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record,\nll. please let me knou. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue\nl2 to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process.\nl3 Nou, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to\nl4 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to\nl5 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.\nl6 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here nou, she's presumed to be innocent. She is\nl7. presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nl8 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nl9 anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\n2o can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged in an\n\n2l indictment and alleged to have commited the crimes charged.-with commiting these-crimes.\n22. ~+That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government can prove a defendant's\n23 ~~ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not have to prove that she\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page6ofl6\n\nl is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on any evidence and a\n\n2 ‘juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.\n\n3 The next thing is that as jurors you must follou the law as I give it to you, even if you\n\n4 don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.\n\n5 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in\n\n6 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in\n\n7 discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on\n\n8 something that you might have read or heard about another case.\n\n9 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not\nlo permited to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts\nll of this case at all. If you see something in the paper or online, you're just going to have to turn\nl2 the page or close the brouser. You can't read it.\nl3 Equally important, you're not permited to discuss this case with anyone else while the\nl4 case is going on. Even with your fellou jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard all\nl5 the evidence and I’ve given my instructions on the law. Again, that's because you can only\nl6 consider the evidence that you hear in the courtroom, not anything outside of the courtroom. You\nl7. have to keep an open mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your\nl8 jury service is complete. You can tell them that you are a juror in a criminal case in federal court\nl9 and that the judge has told you that you are not permited to say anything further.\n2o Similarly, until you are excused from jury service, you cannot post anything about your\n2ls‘ experience as a juror on Facebook, Twiter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of social media.\n22. Another <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, you can't look up or google or do any other kind of research or search in any\n\n23 manner about anything related to the case or anyone involved in the case.\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page /7 of l6\n\nl The reason for these rules, as I am sure you understand, is they protect the integrity of the\n\n2 trial and assure that both sides receive a fair trial.\n\n3 Jurors in criminal cases base their verdicts on the evidence that they hear in the\n\n4 courtroom, not on something that somebody else tells you, not on something that you see on TV\n\n5 or on social media.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAt the November l, 2o2l pretrial conference, the Court directed the parties to file a joint\nleter regarding protections for witness identities at trial. In particular, the Court directed the\nparties to: (l) provide nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected, (2) propose\nprocedures for voir dire related to witness identities, (3) submit a proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to the jury\nregarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or under their first name only, and (4) address\nthe logistics of offering sealed or redacted exhibits containing personal identifying information.\nBelou are the positions of the parties regarding these logistical considerations. Because this leter\ncontains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the\nCourt accept the Government’s proposed redactions to this leter.\n\nGovernment position:\nI. Nomenclature\n\nWith respect to nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected at trial,\nthe Government respectfully submits the follouing chart, which provides the true names of\nwitnesses and the proposed nomenclature for those witnesses at trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 432 Filed ll/lo/2l Page3of5\nPage 3\nGovernment requests that the Court direct prospective jurors to read the sheet and to raise a hand\nif they are familiar with the witnesses or locations. Examination of jurors on this subject would\nthen be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness identifying\ninformation.\nIi. Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span>\n\nThe Government requests that the Court give the jury an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that is similar to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> Judge Garaufis gave the jury in United States v. Raniere, l8 Cr. 2o4 (E.D.N.Y.). In\nthat case, Judge Garaufis instructed the jury:\n\nYou may have noticed during yesterday's testimony that the witness used first\n\nnames of certain individuals. That is because the names of certain alleged victims\n\nare being withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those\n\nindividuals. I have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by\n\ntheir first names only; houever, those full names are knoun to the Government, the\n\ndefendant, and to the Court.\nAn excerpt of the relevant transcript is enclosed as Exhibit A. Here, the Government proposes that\nthe Court instruct the jury:\n\nAt this trial, certain witnesses will be testifying under their first name only. Other\n\nwitnesses will be testifying under pseudonyms — that is, under different names.\n\nThat is because the names of certain alleged victims and related witnesses are being\n\nwithheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I\n\nhave therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by their first names\n\nonly, or in some instances, by using a pseudonym.

Sealed and Redacted Exhibits\n\nThe Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions\nto protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to\nlogistics, the Government would propose submiting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an\nindex noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November\n29, 2o2l. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions,\nthe Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial.\n\nThe Government has considered hou best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while\nprotecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the\nGovernment is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom\nmay be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are\nvisible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to\nprovide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits.

Publicizing their names will subject them to unwanted atention at the time they\nare testifying in a criminal sex abuse trial.‘\n\nTaken together, requiring the Minor Victims to testify under their true and full names\nimposes serious costs on them. It is inconsistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act’s\nexhortation that victims are to be treated with respect for their “dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). And requiring victims of sex crimes to provide their names in public could chill\ntheir willingness to testify, for fear of having their personal histories publicized as they rebuild\ntheir lives. See Order at 2, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7), Dkt. No.\n34. It could also cause other victims—including minors—to avoid seeking help from law\nenforcement because of fear that coming forward could subject them to further harassment and\nembarrassment. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 Advisory Commitee Note (explaining that, by protecting\nthe victim “against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that\nis associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details,” the rule “encourages victims of\nsexual misconduct to . . . participate in legal proceedings against alleged offenders”).\n\n* The Government would consent to an appropriate jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> explaining that the reason for\nthe precautions is “regard for the witnesses’ and non-witness victims’ privacy,” and that no\ninference should be drawn against the defendant because of those precautions.

The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 4o\n\nFinally, the defense argues that this motion is purely tactical on the part of the Government,\nbecause this motion affords sympathy to the victims. (Def. Opp. at 22). Remarkably—and\nunfortunately—the defense again repeats their claim that testimony is being fabricated. (/d.). The\nGovernment is responding to the real concerns of its victims, as it is duty-bound to do, and as is\ncommon in cases involving sexual abuse. It has also already agreed to a jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, as is\nsometimes given in these cases, explaining that the use of pseudonyms and first names should not\nbe held against the defendant. (See Gov’t Mot. at l4 n.4). If any tactical gamesmanship is\noccurring, it is on the part of the defense, which spends a few paragraphs out of nearly twenty\npages of their brief offering conclusory reasons why privacy safeguards undermine a defense\ninterest. As the defense is well aware, such safeguards are significant to the Minor Victims and\ntheir willingness to testify. But the Court need not arbitrate issues of litigation tactics. The balance\nof interests on this issue is clear and weighs in favor of privacy safeguards, as it did in many other\ntrials involving sex crimes.\n\nE. Sealing Related Exhibits is Entirely Appropriate\n\nJust as the Government’s proposal is narrouly tailored with respect to the defendant, so it\nis narrouly tailored with respect to the right of the public and the press to access the trial. The\npublic and press are free to atend the entire trial. They may observe each of the Minor Victims,\nin person, testify in full. At no point during testimony is the Government seeking closure of the\ncourtroom. The public and the press are also welcome to see most of the trial exhibits.\n\nThe only narrou exception is for those exhibits that specifically contain identifying\ninformation of Minor Victims. As the Court is well aware, the right to access trial evidence is not\nabsolute, and it can be overcome—especially by information that is “traditionally considered\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6536\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7ofl2\nARGUMENT\nI.

She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\nconspiracy to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n! This individual is described in the S2 Superseding Indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the\nindividuals identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2,\nrespectively.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo663l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of2l\nFor the reasons stated belou, the Court should not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 at\ntrial as evidence of the charged conspiracies or as “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b). In the\nalternative, the Court should preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3\nas a “minor” or asserting that Accuser-3 was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts. The\nCourt should also preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that Epstein\n“sexually abused” her and give the jury an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the alleged\nconduct was lawful and that the sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal” or “criminal” or\n“unlawful” for the purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment.”\nARGUMENT\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 4o4(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of\n\n“crimes, wrongs, or acts” other than those charged in the indictment. United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). The rule provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n(l) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is\n\nnot admissible to prove a person’s character in order to shou that on\n\na particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\n\ncharacter.\n\n(2) Permited Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n\npurpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\n\nplan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(l)-(2). For other act evidence to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), (l) it\nmust be offered for a proper purpose, (2) it must be relevant to a disputed issue, and (3) the\nprobative value of the evidence cannot be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair\n> For the same reasons, Ms. Maxwell also renews her motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 from the\nS2 Indictment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloof2l\nprejudice pursuant to Rule 4o3; in addition, (4) at defendant’s request, the district court should\ngive the jury an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.

R. Evid. 4o4(b)).\n\nWhen the government must prove a conspiracy charge, evidence of other acts commited\n“in furtherance of the conspiracy” is not “other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b), but rather, it is\ndirect evidence of the acts charged in the Indictment. United States v. Tounsend, No. Sl o6 CR.\n34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Concepcion,\n983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992)). Houever, “other acts” are only admissible as evidence of a\nconspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.” United States v. Cummings,\n6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)).\n\nEvidence of uncharged conduct is not considered other act evidence under Rule 4o4(b)\n“if it [l] arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, [2] if it\nis inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense, or [3] if it is\nnecessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” United States v. Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d\n367, 37o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (quoting United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo)).\nHouever, “where it is not manifestly clear that the evidence in question is intrinsic proof of the\ncharged crime, the proper course is to proceed under Rule 4o4(b).” Tounsend, 2oo7 WL\nl288597, at *l (citing Nektalov, 325 F.

Such a rule would allou the government to entirely circumvent Rule 4o4(b)\nsimply by charging other act conduct in the indictment.\n\nMoreover, without a proper limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, there is a serious risk that the jury will\nview this lawful conduct as evidence of criminal propensity. See United States v. Dolney, No.\no4-CR-l59 (NGG), 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (E.D.N_Y. Sept. l, 2oo5) (benefit of applying Rule\n4o4(b) is “the value that a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> will have in ensuring that the jury does not view\nthe defendants’ alleged prior conduct as evidence of the defendants’ propensity to engage in\ncriminal activity”). At the very least, it is not “manifestly clear” that the evidence related to\nAccuser-3 is proof of the charged Mann Act conspiracies. Accordingly, “the proper course is to\nproceed under Rule 4o4(b).” Tounsend, 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l (citing Nektalov, 325 F. Supp.\n2d at 372).\n\nIll. Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Admissible Under Rule 4o4(b) and Should be\n\nExcluded Under Rule 4o3\n\nThe Court should also not admit evidence related to Accuser-3 as Rule 4o4(b) evidence\nbecause it will be offered solely to shou Ms. Maxwell’s criminal propensity and will be unfairly\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo664o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7of2l\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6643\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span>\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i//egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel9of 2l\nactivity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>,\nthere exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 2l\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence related to Accuser-3\nbecause it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and\nRule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

(internal quotation\nmarks and citations omited).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is direct evidence of the charged criminal conduct—\nspecifically, the conspiracies in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. Minor Victim-3’s\nexpected testimony describes a patern in which the defendant and Epstein groom a young girl, ask\nher to massage Epstein, sexualize that massage, invite the girl to travel, and ask her to find other\ngirls for Epstein. The Government expects that Minor Victim-3’s testimony, which concerns a\nperiod of time overlapping with or in close proximity to other Minor Victims’ experiences with\nthe defendant and Epstein and concerns teenagers of similar ages, will significantly overlap with\nthe testimony of those other Minor Victims. Put simply, Minor Victim-3’s account is\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 53 of 84\nbecause evidence was “pertinent to whether he used the internet in an atempt to engage in sexual\nconduct with” putative victim).\n\nThe defense argues that this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. See\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. According to the defense, if Minor Victim-3 testifies that she had sex with a\n“much older man when she was l7 years old” or that she was sexually abused, the jury will assume\nthat Epstein engaged in illegal conduct, which will somehou prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.\n4 at l3). The Court should not assume that the jury will speculate about principles of United\nKingdom law and apply them to this case. The Court will properly instruct the jury on the elements\nof the offenses charged in the Indictment and the evidence that the jury can—and cannot—\nconsider. Those instructions will not ask the jury to consider or pass upon any aspect of United\nKingdom law, which will not be in evidence at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the\nGovernment’s opposition to the defendant’s pretrial motion to strike references to Minor Victim-\n3 in the Indictment, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-\n2. The risk of unfair prejudice is therefore minimal.\n\nIn the alternative, the defense seeks three rulings: (l) precluding the Government from\nreferring to Minor Victim-3 as a “minor,” (2) precluding the Government and Minor Victim-3\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, and (3) giving a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nabout United Kingdom law. The defense’s requested rulings are not grounded in law or reason.\n\nFirst, the defense claims that Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as a “minor” because\nshe was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions at the times she had sexual contact\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo676l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 54 of 84\nwith Epstein. When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> about United Kingdom law. The defense has\ndemonstrated no unfair prejudice that might warrant a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, and the defense’s\nproposed instructions would only confuse the jury. The jury will be instructed to consider only\n\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006763.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 55 of 84\nthe elements of the crimes the Court provides them, so any assumptions the jury might make about\nUnited Kingdom law are irrelevant.!4 See United States v. Vasquez, 82 F.3d 574, 577 (2d Cir.\nl996) (appropriate to reject defense request for an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> if it does not “represent[] a theory\nof the defense with a basis in the record that would lead to acquital”). And the proposed jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 “cannot be considered ‘illegal’ or\n‘criminal’ or ‘unlawful’ for purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment” (Def. Mot. 4 at l5),\nis wrong on the law. The sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of the defendant’s\nguilt of those crimes. The <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the defense proposes, in contrast, creates serious risk that\nthe jury will think the Court is telling them that the conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to\nthe case. It is not irrelevant: it is direct evidence of the crimes charged, and it should be put before\nthe jury.\nIV. There is No Basis to Preclude Co-Conspirator Statements at Trial\n\nOn October ll, the Government provided the defense with comprehensive Jencks Act\nmaterial for trial witnesses and its exhibits, along with a leter telling the defense, consistent with\nthe Court’s order, the identities of the individuals the Government intends to argue are co-\nconspirators at trial. The defense nonetheless asks the Court to enter an order precluding the\nGovernment from introducing any co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence\n‘4 Tn the event the Court instructs the jury on the age of consent in the United Kingdom, the\nGovernment requests that the Court also instruct the jury that the United Kingdom’s age of consent\nis irrelevant and they should not consider it.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 56 of 84\n8o2(d)(2)(E) because it claims the Government failed to comply with the Court’s September 3,\n2o2l Order. (Def. Mot. l at l). The defense misreads this Court’s September 3, 2o2l Order to\nrequire the Government to do something unprecedented: identify and itemize for the defense each\nand every co-conspirator statement it plans to use at trial, seven weeks in advance of trial. Then,\ncomplaining that the Government has not complied with the defense’s peculiar reading, the\ndefense seeks an extraordinary remedy: precluding the Government from offering any co-\nconspirator statements at trial. Each step of this analysis is erroneous, and the Court should deny\nthe motion.\n\nA. Background\n\nThe defendant first sought to compel the Government to identify the co-conspirator\nstatements it plans to use at trial in its initial round of pretrial motions. There, the defendant argued\nthat the Second Circuit’s practice of conditional admission of co-conspirator statements at trial\nwould prejudice her because “any cautionary <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would be of doubtful utility.” (Mem. of\nLaw at l3, Dkt. No. l48). She therefore asked the Court to order a “proffer from the government\nor conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.” (/d. at l3-l4).\n\nIn response, the Government observed that the practice of conditional admission of co-\nconspirator statements is the law of the Circuit, notwithstanding the defense’s preference to the\ncontrary. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4). The Government also explained that “the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.” (/d.). See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283,\n284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s order directing the\nGovernment to “produce all oral statements made by the defendants and coconspirators that the\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act production—\nand specifically, the Government’s production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is irrelevant. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 79 of 84\ncredibility.”). Prosecutors are simply using a term that is consistent with the Government’s theory\nof the case. See United States v. Edwards, No. CR l6-lo3-BLG-SPW-l, 2ol7 WL 4l59365, at\n*l (D. Mont. Sept. l9, 2ol7) (explaining that “use of the term ‘victim’ is not prejudicial to the\ndefendant’s rights when the presentation of evidence taken as a whole clarifies the government’s\nburden of proving all of the elements of the crime” and finding that the “jury will not be unduly\nprejudiced against [the defendant] if the government refers to certain witnesses as victims’); (citing\nUnited States v. Washburn, 444 F.3d loo7, lol3 (8th Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] number of courts have\ndetermined that the use of the term “victim” in jury instructions is not prejudicial to a defendant’s\nrights when, as is the case here, the instructions taken as a whole clarify the government’s burden\nof proving all elements of the crime”)); Server v. Mizell, 9o2 F.2d 6ll, 6l5 (7th Cir. l99o) (“No\nlogical argument can be made that the mere use of the term ‘victim’ [in jury instructions] somehou\nshifted the burden of proof.”). In addition, “[t]he term ‘victim’ is not inherently prejudicial. It is\na term commonly used in the English language that does not by its nature connote guilt.” United\nStates v. Lussier, No. l8-CR-28l (NEB), 2ol9 WL 24899o6, at *5 (D. Minn. June l5, 2ol9).7!\nAnd just as the defense may make arguments atacking the credibility of victims, the Government\nis free to argue that these witnesses are, in fact, victims of a crime. Cf United States v. Thai, 29\nF.3d 785, 8o7 (2d Cir. l994) (explaining that prosecutors may also “respond to an argument that\nimpugns its integrity or the integrity of its case’’).\n\n7l The same is true with references by the Government to “minor victims.” (Cf Def. Mot. l2 at 4-\n5). The Government does not expect any other trial participant to use the phrase “minor victims.”\n78\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006893.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 52\n\n\"In assessing whether a district court properly admited other act evidence, we consider\nwhether (l) it was offered for a proper purpose; (2) it was relevant to a material issue in dispute;\n(3) its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect; and (4) the trial court\ngave an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to the jury if so requested by the defendant.” United\nStates v.

As this Court previously has\nruled:\n\n\"To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\n\n‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence\n\nand jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that\n\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an\n\noffense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y. D’Amelio, 683\n\nF.3d 4l2, 4l6 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729\n\n(Q2d_ Cir. l988)). Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s constitutional rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7. In contrast to a\n\nconstructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the\n\nindictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially\n\ndifferent from those alleged in the indictment.” /d. (quoting United States _v.\n\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62l (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nUnited States v. Gross, l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7).\n\nAs this Court then recognized, the Second Circuit has consistently relied on the same\nstart and end dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial proof did not affect a constructive\namendment or variance. See id. (\"The indictment and the evidence at trial contained the same\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy...\") (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n229 (2d.

Dupre, 462 F.3d l3l, l4l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"The\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in the indictment correspond to the conspiracy\nproven at trial...\"). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony — for the post-conspiracy\ntime eric {NN\nWE. Who never met any of the four accusers as far as can be gleaned, and the documents she\nintends to authenticate, run a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will not be the\nsame core evidence charged in the Indictment because it will be based on evidence that post-\ndates the events charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 52\n\nThus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in\n\nforensic setings as it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard. .\n\n.. Right nou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles\n\nand methods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nAt a minimum, therefore, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing.\n\nIV. THE COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE EVIDENCE RELATED i\n\na\n\nThe government’s arguments in favor of admiting evidence related xq\n2S ‘lirect evidence of the charged conspiracies all but concede that the\nevidence is more appropriately considered under Rule 4o4(b). In an effort to bolster their\nposition, the government makes the sweeping assertion that as long as yy was\nunder the age of l8, her evidence is admissible as direct evidence of the conspiracy. That is a\nfundamentally incorrect statement of the law and should be rejected. The government’s\narguments for admiting evidence under Rule 4o4(b) and for denying the\ndefense’s requested limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> are similarly baseless. The Court should therefore\nexclude evidence related to qq or, if it is admited, give the jury the requested\nlimiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.’\n\nThe government advances four principal arguments for why evidence related to yy\nME should be admited as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies: (l) her testimony\nallegedly shous a “patern” of hou Epstein and Ms. Maxwell sexually abused young women and\nestablishes Ms. Maxwell’s “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies (Resp. at 45-46),\n(2) her allegations are included in the S2 Indictment and are therefore not covered by Rule\n\n’ As it pertains to | and the other accusers, the defense will be submiting\nproposed jury instructions and special verdict findings.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 52\n\nThe very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the conspiracy. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a conspiracy because Curley was not charged with a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of interstate violation of\na protection order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\nconspiracy. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47. But as the defense pointed out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as\nevidence of a conspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.’ United States\nv. Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4), vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763\n(2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)). The\ngovernment has not explained why gg evidence provides any proof that Ms.\nMaxwell “furthered” an alleged conspiracy to cause minors (she did not) to travel (she did not)\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

See id. at 49-5o. According to\nthe government, “all that is required” for ME evidence to be admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies is that she was under the age of l8, the age of consent\nunder U.S. federal law, and that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein intended to engage in sexual\ncontact with her. See id.\nIt is the government, not the defense, that apparently does not understand the law. The\nMann Act conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment each require proof that Ms. Maxwell acted\nwith the intent that the alleged victim would “engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. ¥f| l2 (citing l8 U.S.C. § 2422), l8 (citing l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). That element incorporates offenses under state law. See United States v. Lincoln, No.\nl9-CR-6o47 (CJS), 2ol9 WL 7l9822, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2ol9) (collecting § 2422 cases);\nUnited States v. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 735 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (summary order) (criminal sexual\nactivity under § 2423 includes crimes “under federal, state, or foreign law’). Indeed, the Mann\nAct conspiracies in the S2 Indictment charge a violation of a New York State misdemeanor as\nthe “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” S2 Ind. § l3b,\nl9b (citing N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55). Section l3o.55 prohibits “subject[ing] another person to\nsexual contact without the later’s consent.” N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. To be guilty of Section\nl3o.55 based on the victim’s incapacity to consent due to age, the victim must be under the age\nof l7. Id. § l3o.o5(3)(a). The government itself acknouledged this in its draft proposed jury\ninstructions, as well as the fact that Ms. Maxwell cannot be convicted of the Mann Act\nconspiracies unless she knew that the alleged victim was under l7. See Gov’t Proposed Jury\nInstructions (“[I]n order to find that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006915.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35of52\nvictim’s age, you must find that the defendant knew that the victim was less than seventeen years\nold.”) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is unclear whether the government is nou claiming that to adm\nevidence as proof of the Mann Act conspiracies, it only needs to prove that\nwas under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged abuse and that Ms. Maxwell did not need to\nknou anything about I age, or that Ms. Maxwell only needed to knou that yy\nME «2s under the age of l8. Either one is a misstatement of the law. For “sexual\nactivity” to be “criminal,” it must be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction where the sex acts\nallegedly took place. If those crimes are based on lack of consent due to age, it is only illegal if\nthe alleged victim is under the age of consent in that jurisdiction. And according to the\ngovernment’s oun proposed jury instructions, Ms. Maxwell can only be found guilty of the\nMann Act conspiracies if she knew |] (and the other alleged victims) were under\nthe age of consent in the particular jurisdictions where the sex acts allegedly took place. Because\nBE 2s, at all times, over the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, her\nevidence is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and is therefore not admissible as\ndirect evidence. At the very least, because it is not “manifestly clear” that\nevidence is proof of the charged conspiracies, “the proper course is to proceed under Rule\n4o4(b).” United States v. Tounsend, No. 8l o6 CR. 34 (JFK), 2oo7 WL l288597, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (citing United States v. Nektalov, 325 F.

See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “irrelevant” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 52\nactivity for which the defendant could be charged with specific New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New\nYork, and Canadian criminal offenses” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, the Court should give\nthe jury the defense’s requested limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.®\n\nV. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER EVIDENCE\n\nOF MS. MAXWELL’S ALLEGED “FLIGHT”\n\nThe government has conceded that it will not elicit any evidence or argue to the jury that\nMs. Maxwell “was hiding from, evading, or fleeing from law enforcement between Epstein’s\narrest and her oun.” Resp. at 8l-82.\n\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER\n\nEVIDENCE OF MS. MAXWELL’S ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nAND AGREES TO MS.

Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients.

Accordingly, this statement\nis admissible as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n\nThis statement is also directly relevant to the charges in the Indictment. Although Epstein\nmade the statement in 2oo5, he was discussing a time in the past when the defendant found girls\nfor him. In other words, this statement references conduct that took place during the period\ncharged in the Indictment. Epstein was telling Employee-l that the defendant took precisely the\nactions alleged in the Indictment by recruiting girls for Epstein.\n\n2. Second Exemplar\n\nThe second exemplar involves instructions provided to Employee-l by Epstein and\nEmployee-2, who was also a co-conspirator. In particular, Employee-l was instructed to go to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence in October of 2oo5 and help someone who was coming to remove\ncomputers from the house.\n\nThis exemplar is a case in which the Government expects to offer the statement without\nuse of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). The instructions are not hearsay because the Government will not offer\nthem for their truth. Rather, these statements are offered to demonstrate their impact on the\nlistener—Employee-l—in order to explain why Employee-l removed computers from Epstein’s\nPalm Beach house in October of 2oo5. Asa result, the proffered statement is not hearsay. Dupree,\n7o6 F.3d at l36 (“[A] statement offered to shou its effect on the listener is not hearsay.”).\n\nAlthough this event post-dated the time period contained in the Indictment, it explains why\nthe members of the Palm Beach Police Department found that computer hard drives appeared to\nbe missing from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence when they executed a search warrant there on\nOctober 2o, 2oo5. In particular, the Government expects a member of the search team to testify\nthat during the search, he observed computer monitors and keyboards without any hard drives\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo696o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006961.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\natached to them, suggesting that electronic equipment had been removed in advance of the search.\nThe absence of that electronic equipment, which resulted from Employee-l removing the\nequipment at Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, will both corroborate that witness’s testimony and will help the\njury understand why they have not been presented with any electronic evidence from the 2oo5\nsearch.\n\nFinally, while the Government does not seek to offer this statement for its truth, the\nGovernment notes that it included the statement within the Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E) disclosure leter\nbecause that is an alternative basis of admission. Like the first exemplar, this statement was made\nduring the sex trafficking conspiracy that continued past 2oo4. The statement was also in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy because it related to efforts to protect co-conspirators from legal\njeopardy so that the conspiracy might continue. Cf United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d l93,\n2l3 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“[A] ‘plot to silence [a] witness[ ]’ is admissible as aco-\nconspirator statement, because the plot “furthers the goals of the conspiracy in that the\n[conspiracy's objectives] would be facilitated by the acquital of all the defendants’” (quoting\nUnited States v. Arrington, 867 F.2d l22, l3o (2d Cir. l989)). Accordingly, although the\nGovernment does not anticipate offering this statement for its truth under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), it\nwould also be admissible on that basis.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo696l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel6 of 43 l6\nLalWmaxC\n\nl that, the defense gets ten peremptories; the government gets\n\n2 six.

First and foremost, as all agree, in addition to a similar acts <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the\nparties’ joint request to charge proposes that the jury be instructed that it cannot convict the\ndefendant solely on the basis of evidence relating to Minor Victim-3, and that an element of the\nMann Act offenses is that the victim must be younger than seventeen.

There is accordingly no risk that the jury will be\nconfused and convict because they think the defendant’s conduct with Minor Victim-3, in\nisolation, violated some law.\n\nIn any event, the touchstone of Rule 4o3 prejudice analysis in this context is whether the\nevidence admited under Rule 4o4(b) is “more sensational or disturbing” than the charged crimes.\nUnited States v. Rosemond, 958 F.3d ll, l25 (2d Cir. 2o2o). That is not the case here. Minor\nVictim-3’s account of sexual exploitation fits neatly into the patern that the other Minor Victims\nwill describe. It is not more sensational or disturbing—and even the defendant has not suggested\notherwise. (See Def. Mot. 4 at l2-l3, Dkt. No. 387; Def. Reply at 29-3o, Dkt. No. 398; ll/ol/2l\nTr. at 82:22-83:5).\n\nInstead, the defense argues that it will be prejudiced if Minor Victim-3 states that she was\n“sexually abused” by Epstein. (Def. Mot. 4 at l3, Dkt.

Minor Victim-3 will not be\nasked to testify about a legal conclusion, nor will she do so. She will simply describe her factual\nexperience. In its briefing, the Government often describes these events as “sexual abuse” and\nMinor Victim-3 as a “victim” because the sexual contact was unwanted and traumatic.® But the\nGovernment will not seek to elicit that phrase from Minor Victim-3.\n\nAccordingly, in the Government’s view, if this evidence is admited under Rule 4o4(b)\nrather than as direct evidence, there is no reason for anything more than the normal Rule 4o4(b)\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> at the time this evidence is offered.’ But the Government would not object to a limiting\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that repeated the expected jury charge, namely, that the jury cannot convict the\ndefendant on the basis of Minor Victim-3’s testimony alone.\n\nAn <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the defendant’s conduct was legal at the time would seriously risk\nmisleading the jury into thinking that, because it was “legal,” it in no way tended to shou the\ndefendant’s culpability of the charged crimes.

The defense has not briefed in detail whether the sexual contact was\nlawful under other U.K. laws concerning prostitution or nonconsensual sexual contact. Absent\nsuch a determination of foreign law, the Court should not instruct the jury that any conduct\noccurring overseas was or was not “legal.”\n\nIf the Court were to give such an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, houever, the Government would request that\n® As noted, the Government is previewing this in order to accurately describe the expected\ntestimony for the Court.

(See ll/ol/2l Tr. 75:9-76:9).\n\n7 The Government proposes the follouing text, adapted from Sand: “You may not consider this\nevidence as any kind of reflection on the defendant’s character or propensity to commit the crimes\ncharged in this indictment.

See ll/5/2o2l\nLtr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to transport minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added).

The lawyer who will be questioning them and the lawyer during\nl4 opening statements will be in that Plexiglass box with the HEPA filter, and they\nl5 will be permited to remove their mask while they provide opening statements, as\nl6 well.\nl7 So at this time I am going to ask all of you to give your undivided atention\nl8 to the lawyers as they make their opening statements.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel4 of 28\nflaws alloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and\n\nto compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which none had complete\n\ninformation about his activities.\n\nEx. l, p 7. This testimony is patently relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and intent and to the\nconspiracy counts. If this “compartmentalization” prevented Ms. Maxwell from having the\nrequired knouledge or intent (an ultimate issue for the jury to decide, on which Dr. Dietz will\nnot opine), then she will be not guilty. The government after all intends to ask the Court to\ninstruct the jury on “willful blindness.” The jury should have the benefit of a scientific\nunderstanding of the manner in which a skilled manipulator could have eluded exposure to those\naround him.\n\nThe government obviously disagrees with Dr. Dietz in his evaluation of Mr. Epstein. But\njust because the government has a different view of the facts does not mean Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is inadmissible. Rule 7o2’s emphasis on “sufficient facts or data” does not “authorize\na trial court to exclude an expert’s testimony on the ground” that the government “believes one\nversion of the facts and not the other.” See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments.\n\nThe government’s second objection is easily addressed. The point of the testimony is not\nto suggest jury nullification, which would be improper as defense counsel and Dr. Dietz well\nknou. Mot. at l7. The testimony is relevant, as explained above. In any case, if the Court is\nconcemed about any potential for Dr. Dietz’s testimony to engender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell,\nthe Court can give a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.

In response, the National Research Council formed a commitee, co-\nchaired by the Honorable Jed Rakoff and Thomas Albright, a prominent cognitive scientist at the\nSalk Institute for Biological Studies. In 2ol4, the commitee published its report: /dentifying the\nCulprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification (Natl. Res.

The commitee recommended\nthat judges admit expert testimony as a way of educating juries on the science of memory. An\nalternative recommendation, having the court deliver a carefully crafted jury instructions that\ncould accomplish this same educational goal, requires the daunting task of devising the right\ninstructions.

Smith, 736 F.2d llo3,\nllo7 (6th Cir. l984) (“The day may have arrived, therefore, when Dr. Fulero’s testimony can be\nsaid to conform to a generally accepted explanatory theory.”)). As also noted by the court in\nSmithers, “[s|tate court decisions also reflect this trend.” (citing State v. Buell, 22 Ohio St.3d\nl24, 489 N.E.2d 795 (l986) (overruling per se rule and holding expert testimony admissible to\ninform jury about factors generally affecting memory process)).

Dr. Hall’s opinions are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 4o3.\n\nThe government’s Rule 4o3 argument is easily resolved. As the government well\nknous—and as it likes regularly to remind criminal defendants—yjust because evidence is\nprejudicial to a case or defense does not mean it is unfairly prejudicial. United States v. Schaffer,\n85l F.3d l66, l82 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“[T]the fact that evidence ‘may be highly prejudicial’ does not\nnecessarily mean that it is ‘unfairly prejudicial.’”). There is significant probative value to Dr.\nHall’s opinions. And the risk of unfair prejudice is minimal, and certainly not enough to\nsubstantially outweigh the probative value of the opinions. Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“The\nprobative value [of mental health condition evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will not\nengage in name-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health issues”\nor unrelated and irrelevant drug use. See id. If the Court is concerned about any unfair prejudice,\nthat concern can be addressed with a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\n4. Rule 7o3 does not bar Dr. Hall from testifying.\n\nThe government makes a last-ditch effort to preclude Dr. Hall from testifying by\ninvoking Rule 7o3. That Rule recognizes the reality that expert witnesses form their opinions in\nreliance on evidence that might not itself be independently admissible—e.g., hearsay.\n\nHere, houever, Rule 7o3 poses no barrier to Dr. Hall’s testimony, because the bases of\nhis opinion are independently admissible and, even if they weren’t, their probative value\nsubstantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o3 says:\n\nAn expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been\n\nmade aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would\n\nreasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagel9 of 25\nthey need not be admissible for the opinion to be admited. But if the facts or data\nwould otherwise be inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them\nto the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion\nsubstantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o3.\n\nThere is no dispute that experts in Dr. Hall’s field reasonably rely on the kinds of facts and\ndata he relied on in forming his opinions. These facts and data, moreover, are otherwise\nadmissible.\n\nDr. Hall relied primarily on an interview with yy statements to\nDr. Hall are not inadmissible hearsay. x\nDn 2missible because they are\nstatements made for medical diagnosis under Rule 8o3(4) and because they are statements of\nthen-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition under Rule 8o3(3).

They are\nalso admissible as prior inconsistent statements under Rule 6l3.\n\nDr. Hall also relied. or\nDn 2o° admissible under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(A).\n\nThe probative value of the bases of Dr. Hall’s opinions substantially outweighs any\nprejudice. There is nothing unfair about telling the jury of the various admissions 3\nhas made and the various inconsistencies in her allegations. Of course, I will be\ntestifying, so the government can examine her about all these issues as well. And the evidence is\nnot being offered to shame her. See Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health\nissues.”).

In particular, the defense is still unclear whether we will be permited to display\ndocuments used for impeachment or refreshing a witness’s recollection in electronic format solely on the\nvideo screens used by the witness, the Court, and the Court’s deputy, or whether we will be required to\nprovide paper copies of these materials, even if the materials do not reference a witness who is testifying\nunder a pseudonym. !\n\nThe defense is sensitive to the Court and the government’s concerns that people siting in the\ngallery of the courtroom do not see any documents that identify the witnesses who are testifying under\npseudonyms. We also understand that the Court wants to ensure that the witnesses will have access to\nthe complete documents that may be used for impeachment and refreshing recollection, rather than a\n' Counsel for the defense understood the discussion on November 23, 2o2l, to apply only to documents which\ncontained identifying information for witnesses who are testifying under pseudonyms or first names. The\ngovernment, houever, has suggested that paper documents need to be used for all impeachment and refreshing,\nwhether or not the documents contain such identifying information.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l2 Filed ll/27/2l Pagelofl\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

First,\n“Thjindsight bias is a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’”\nAdams v. Lab’y Corp. of Am., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). Because the expert’s\n“opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common knouledge and common\nsense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp. Holdings, Inc., No. l6-CV-\n2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting 4 Weinstein’s Federal\nEvidence § 7o2.o3 (2ol9)). Indeed, neither the Government nor the Court could identify a\nfederal court that has admited expert testimony on the jury’s hindsight bias. Gov’t Br. at l4.\nThe Defense cites no such case law in its response. Second, even if the jury’s hindsight bias\nwere a relevant topic of expert testimony, the Court would exclude it because of Rule 4o3\nprejudice. The Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess evidence and determine Ms.\nMaxwell’s intent. An expert <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on hindsight bias risks confusing the jury and usurping\nthe Court’s role in instructing the jury as to the law. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 397.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion on the so-called halo effect. Specifically, the Defense\nexpects that Dr. Dietz would testify that an individual’s positive traits—like atractiveness,\ncharisma, intelligence, and status—can cause other people to overlook the individual’s negative\ntraits. Notice at 5—6. Dr. Dietz would testify that Jeffrey Epstein “exploited the Halo effect to\nsurround himself with people who would serve his needs” while “compartmentaliz[ing]” what\nthey knew about his activities. Jd. at 6-7. The Defense argues that the opinion is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge of Epstein’s conspiracy. Def. Br. at 9-lo. The Government argues that\nsuch testimony is irrelevant to any defense and that it improperly suggests sympathy and\nnullification. Gov’t Br. at l5-l6. It further argues that Dr. Dietz’s opinion on Epstein\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page/7ofl7\nspecifically is inadmissible as a vehicle for factual narrative based on only limited writen\nrecords. /d. at l7.\n\nThe Court first concludes that Dr. Dietz’s general opinion on the existence of a\nphenomenon called “the halo effect” is admissible. The testimony may be relevant to the jury’s\ndetermination of Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge because it could explain hou, for example, Ms.\nMaxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse but without any intent or knouledge of that\nresult. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion of nullification can be addressed with a\nlimiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nThe Court will, houever, without a further shouing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.\nDietz from applying the halo effect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with\n“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders” that “alloued him to use\nhis brilliance to manipulate people.” Notice at 6-7. Dr. Dietz never met or examined Epstein\nbut instead bases this opinion on documents that he reviewed, including media interviews of\nEpstein, evidence from the Florida investigation of Epstein, and materials produced in this\nlitigation. Jd. at 6; Def. Br., Ex. l at l66-68. But neither Dr. Dietz nor the Defense has offered\nsupport for the claim that this is a reliable means by which an expert in Dr. Dietz’s field would\ndiagnose an individual. Typically, federal courts admit an expert diagnosis of a personality\ndisorder only if the expert personally interviewed the diagnosed individual. F.g., Tchatat v. City\nof New York, 3l5 F.R.D. 44l, 445-47 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6); United States v. Falcon, 245 F. Supp. 2d\nl239, l244 (S.D. Fla. 2oo3); see also Tardif 'v. City of New York, 344 F.

It's concise, it's clear, and will clarify\n\n4 the issues for the jurors as opposed to confuse the issues. I\na think the government's <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is exactly the opposite. It\n6 is cumbersome, it is difficult to follou, and it will confuse\n\n7 rather than to clarify.\n\n8 And I will just point out, I think your Honor\n\n9 identified the correct example, which is Accuser 2, which is\n\nlo alleged events that took place in New Mexico when she was above\nll the age of consent for those acts in New Mexico.\n\nl2 And so this illustrates the problem of trying to prove\nl3 a conspiracy where the illegal sexual activity is a violation\nl4 of New York law with acts that took place in other\n\nl5 jurisdictions which were legal and have nothing to do with New\nl6 York law.\n\nl7 So as I think you've discussed before, your Honor, if\nl8 the witness is going to testify to these events that took place\nl9 in New Mexico, even though they're legal under New York law --\n2o there's no issue there -- they're going to --\n2l THE COURT: Not under New York law.\n22 MR.

Our point is that it is not a straightforward\n\n7 question that any sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico\n8 was necessarily above New Mexico's oun age of consent. So at\n9 least the legal accuracy of that has not been established at\nlo this point.\n\nll THE COURT: Will it be an issue in trial?\n\nl2 MR. ROHRBACH: No, your Honor, because the government\nl3 is not planning to put on evidence aimed at meeting any\n\nl4 particular New Mexico offense, since that's not the charges\n\nl5 that we've established in this case. That's just a point in\nl6 terms of the accuracy of the proposed jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> -- that\nl7 is, whether the sexual conduct was legal or illegal within New\nl8 Mexico.\n\nl9 THE COURT: So what I had said was, \"I anticipate\n2o you'll hear testimony from the next witness about sexual\nal conduct that she says she had with Mr. Epstein in New Mexico.\"\n22 And then I had suggested, because it's what I understood from\n23 the parties, \"I instruct you that because the witness was over\n24 the age of consent in New Mexico at the relevant time period,\n25 the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document536 Filed l2/lo/2l Page 38of43 38\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl Honor.  -- New Mexico law, that we would have a substantive\n\n2 violation in addition for this witness.

The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice.

Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases.

I would also\n4 encourage the parties to discuss stipulations in this regard to\na provide the jury any necessary and non-prejudicial context or\n\n6 background, or other proposals for permiting the jury to\n\n7 understand the background or context without crossing over into\n8 the 4o3 prejudice line.\n\n9 I also would permit the defense to cross-examine law\nlo enforcement officers about the investigative steps that were\n\nll taken if the government puts the thoroughness of the\n\nl2 investigation into issue as this, too, would be permissible\n\nl3 impeachment and cross.\n\nl4 These articulated lines of cross-examination of\n\nl5 government witnesses would be relevant to impeach a witness by\nl6 suggesting bias or otherwise implicating their credibility.\n\nl7 Moreover, denying Ms. Maxwell these lines of questioning would\nl8 have implications under the confrontation clause. The Court\n\nl9 expects that the probative value would not be substantially\n2o outweighed by 4o3 prejudice if done along the lines of what I\n2l have indicated, especially if accompanied by a limiting\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> by the Court that, for example, prior inconsistent\n23 statements are to be considered for their impeachment value and\n24 the like.\n25 Similarly, the Court may instruct the jury that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Pagellof3\nU.S. Department of Justice\n(@ - Sa United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government writes regarding the two issues remaining follouing today’s charge\nconference.\n\nFirst, the Government opposes the addition of Sand <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> 7-l2 regarding the\nimpeachment of witnesses by felony convictions. That limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is meant to “tell the\njury why the felony conviction was put before them.” Sand Instr. 7-l2 cmt. It is useful in cases\nin which the prior felony convictions are sufficiently significant that they are an important part of\nthe defense, and an explanation would aid the jury in evaluating the evidence. In such a case, it\naids the jury to knou that the prior conviction was offered solely for the purpose of evaluating the\nwitness’ credibility. Here, the only witnesses whose prior convictions were elicited are Carolyn\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page2of3\nand Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—\nand not at all on cross-examination. Including the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on credibility, <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> 44. That <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is unavailable to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v. Myerson, l8 F.3d l53, l58 (2d Cir. l994) (collecting cases);\nsee United States v. Romero, 3o4 F. App’x l4, l8 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (summary order) (affirming the\n“equally unavailable” <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> where a witness invoked the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment); Sand Instr. 6-7 (explaining that the “uncalled witness equally available” <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n“includes situations when the witness has indicated that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right\nnot to testify if called”). That is a sensible result: a witness with criminal jeopardy is not\n“available” to the Government in any more than an abstract sense. To obtain their testimony, the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page3of3\nGovernment would have to seek a Court order that materially alters public interests by\njeopardizing—if not forgoing—any future criminal case against that individual.\n\nIn United States v. Jones, l7 Cr. 79l (LAK), Judge Kaplan rejected this defense argument\non stronger facts for the defense. There, the defense sought to force the Government to immunize\na defense witness. See Tr. 868-, id. (Dec. ll, 2ol9). The Court denied that request and\nsubsequently instructed the jury that the parties “had the same opportunity or lack of opportunity\nto call witnesses.” Tr. l3lo, id. (Dec. l6, 2ol9). Here, the defense at no point sought to immunize\nany particular witnesses. And although at the charge conference the defense identified one witness\nwho the defense said had criminal exposure, it is evident that this case also involves numerous\nuncalled witnesses who were available for the defense to call, including Virginia Roberts.\nParticularly given the facts of this case, there is no basis to deviate from the standard <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\non the equal availability of witnesses.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: ___s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: Defense Counsel (by ECF)\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo843o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document556 - Filed l2/l9/2l Pagelof2\nU.S. Department of Justice\n—s United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

In other words, Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove her innocence.\n\n8 This presumption of innocence was with Ms. Maxwell when the trial began and remains\n\n9 with Ms. Maxwell unless and until you are convinced that the Government has proven her guilt\nlo beyond a reasonable doubt as to each charge. Even though Ms. Maxwell has presented evidence\nll. inher defense, the presumption of innocence remains with her and it is not her burden to prove\nl2 that she is innocent.

The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in\n\n4 reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a\n\n5 reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.\n\n6 Reasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience,\n\n7 and your common sense. Reasonable doubt is not whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to\n\n8 avoid an unpleasant duty. Nor is it sympathy for the Defendant. The law in a criminal case is\n\n9 that it is sufficient if the guilt of the Defendant is established beyond a reasonable doubt, not\nlo beyond all possible doubt. Therefore, if, after a fair and impartial consideration of all the\nll evidence, you can candidly and honestly say that you do have an abiding belief of Ms.\nl2. Maxwell’s guilt as to any crime charged in this case, such a belief as a prudent person would be\nl3 _-willing to act upon in important maters in the personal affairs of his or her oun life, then you\nl4 have no reasonable doubt, and under such circumstances it is your duty to convict Ms. Maxwell\nl5 of the particular crime in question.\nl6 On the other hand, if after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can\nl7 candidly and honestly say that you are not satisfied with Ms. Maxwell’s guilt as to any charge,\nl8 that you do not have an abiding belief of her guilt as to that charge—in other words, if you have\nl9 such a doubt as would reasonably cause a prudent person to hesitate in acting in maters of\n2o ‘importance in his or her oun affairs—then you have a reasonable doubt, and in that circumstance\n2l ‘it is your duty to acquit Ms. Maxwell of that charge.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo847o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Pagel5 of 82\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No.9: |The Indictment\n2 The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been formally charged in what is called an\n3 “Indictment.” As I instructed you at the outset of this trial, the Indictment is simply a charge or\n4 accusation.

Unlike the conspiracy\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A conspiracy to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the conspiracy. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make conspiracy, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the conspiracy is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a conspiracy exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a conspiracy charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the conspiracy was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562- Filed l2/l7/2l Page 45 of 82\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice minors to travel to engage in sexual\n\n5 activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.

The Southern District of New York\n\n5 encompasses the follouing counties: New York County (i.e., Manhatan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll wasanice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 ~ that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 6o of 82\n\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 43: Inferences\n\n2 During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 _ based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. _-will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23 crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 62 of 82\n\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 44: Credibility of Witnesses\n\n2 You have had the opportunity to observe the witnesses.

Or did the witness appear evasive, as though the witness was trying to hide something?\n\n8 Hou responsive was the witness to the questions asked on direct examination and on cross-\n\n9 examination?

You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a\nl5 verdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your\nl6 clear thinking, there is a risk that you will not arrive at a just verdict.\nl7 As you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellou jurors, and ask for an\nl8 opportunity to express your oun views. Every juror should be heard. No one juror should hold\nl9 center stage in the jury room and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations.\n2o If, after listening to your fellou jurors and if, after stating your oun view, you become\n2l convinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change\n22 your view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely\n23 because of the opinions of your fellou jurors or because you are outnumbered.

The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in\n\n4 reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a\n\n5 reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.\n\n6 Reasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience,\n\n7 and your common sense. Reasonable doubt is not whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to\n\n8 avoid an unpleasant duty. Nor is it sympathy for the Defendant.

Unlike the conspiracy\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A conspiracy to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the conspiracy. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make conspiracy, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the conspiracy is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a conspiracy exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a conspiracy charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the conspiracy was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 ina conspiracy to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the conspiracy and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the conspiracy charges.

A person may have several different purposes or motives for such conduct, and each may\nl9 prompt in varying degrees the person’s actions.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll. people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 47 of l67\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7\n5 miners-to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a\n6 criminal offense.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll was anice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 Filed l2/l8/2l Page 62 of l67\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 43: Inferences\n\nZz During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll. direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 _ evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o —‘-your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 ~~ guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23s crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo86oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 64 of l67\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 44: Credibility of Witnesses\n\nZz You have had the opportunity to observe the witnesses. It is your job to decide hou\n\n3 believable each witness was in his or her testimony. You are the sole judges of the credibility of\n\n4 the witnesses. Hou do you evaluate the credibility or believability of the witnesses? The answer\n\n5 is that you use your common sense, judgment, and experience. Common sense is your greatest\n\n6 asset as ajuror. You should ask yourselves, did the witness impress you as honest, open, and\n\n7 candid? Or did the witness appear evasive, as though the witness was trying to hide something?\n\n8 | Hou responsive was the witness to the questions asked on direct examination and on cross-\n\n9 examination? Consider the witness’s demeanor, manner of testifying, and accuracy of the\nlo ~—_-witness’s recollection. In addition, consider hou well the witness recounted what was heard or\nll. observed, as the witness may be honest but mistaken.\nl2 If you find that a witness is intentionally telling a falsehood that is always a mater of\nl3. importance that you should weigh carefully. If you find that any witness has lied under oath at\nl4 _ this trial, you should view the testimony of such a witness cautiously and weigh it with great\nl5 care. You may reject the entirety of the witness testimony, part of it or none of it. It is for you to\nl6 decide hou much of any witness’s testimony, if any, you wish to credit. A witness may be\nl7 ‘inaccurate, contradictory, or even untruthful in some respects and yet entirely believable and\nl8 truthful in other respects. It is for you to determine whether such untruths or inconsistencies are\nl9 significant or inconsequential, and whether to accept or reject all or to accept some and reject the\n2o _ balance of the testimony of any witness.\n2l In evaluating credibility of the witnesses, you should take into account any evidence that\n22 the witness who testified may benefit in some way from the outcome of this case. If you find\n23 ‘that any witness whose testimony you are considering may have an interest in the outcome of\n24 this trial, then you should bear that factor in mind when evaluating the credibility of his or her\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo86o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 65 of l67\n\nl testimony and accept it with great care. This is not to suggest that any witness who has an\n\n2 interest in the outcome of a case would testify falsely. It is for you to decide to what extent, if at\n\n3 all, the witness’s interest has affected or colored his or her testimony.\n\n4 You have heard the testimony of a witness who was previously convicted of a crime,\n\n5 punishable by more than one year in jail. This prior conviction was put into evidence for you to\n\n6 consider in evaluating the witness’ credibility. You may consider the fact that the witness who\n\n7 testified is a convicted felon in deciding hou much of his or her testimony to accept and what\n\n8 weight, if any, it should be given.\n\n9 You are not required to accept testimony even though the testimony is not contradicted\nlo and the witness’s testimony is not challenged. You may decide because of the witness’s bearing\nll. or demeanor, or because of the inherent improbability of the testimony, or for other reasons\nl2 ~— sufficient to yourselves that the testimony is not worthy of belief. On the other hand, you may\nl3. find, because of a witness’s bearing and demeanor and based upon your consideration of all the\nl4 other evidence in the case, that the witness is truthful.\n\nl5 Thus, there is no magic formula by which you can evaluate testimony. You bring to this\nl6 courtroom all your experience and common sense. You determine for yourselves in many\nl7 circumstances the reliability of statements that are made by others to you and upon which you\nl8 are asked to rely and act. You may use the same tests here that you use in your everyday lives.\nl9 You may consider the interest of any witness in the outcome of this case and any bias or\n2o prejudice of any such witness, and this is true regardless of who called or questioned the witness.\n2l Finally, as you knou, I have permited certain witnesses to be referred to in open court\n22 either by their first name or a pseudonym.

If the Government has\n\n7 succeeded, your verdict should be guilty as to that charge; if it has failed, your verdict should be\n\n8 not guilty as to that charge.\n\n9 You must base your verdict solely on the evidence or lack of evidence and these\nlo instructions as to the law, and you are obliged under your oath as jurors to follou the law as I\nll have instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the particular law in question.\nl2 Under your oath as jurors, you are not to be swayed by sympathy. You should be guided\n\n| l3. solely bye the evidence presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you, without regard\nl4 to the consequences of your decision. You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a\nl5 verdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your\nl6 clear thinking, there is a risk that you will not arrive at a just verdict.\nl7 As you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellou jurors, and ask for an\nl8 opportunity to express your oun views. Every juror should be heard. No one juror should hold\nl9 center stage in the jury room and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations.\n2o If, after listening to your fellou jurors and if, after stating your oun view, you become\n2l convinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change\n22 your view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely\n23 because of the opinions of your fellou jurors or because you are outnumbered. Your final vote\n24 ~=must reflect your conscientious belief as to hou the issues should be decided.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo862o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 85 of l67\n\nl Table of Contents\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. l: Role of the Court ......cccccccccsccscsccceccecceeccescecceccaceescececceccecseesceecasceccescceseeeceeeeeeee D\n\n4 <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2: Role of the Jury ..........ccccsscccsssssccecessecceessceceesscceessessseececesssecsesseceesessseseresssesneeees O\n\n5 <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 3: Contact with Others/Social Media .......cccccsccscsccesceccecsccsceccesceccesccesceccesccecaeeeee 7\n\n6 <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 4: Statements of Counsel and Court Not Evidence; Jury’s Recollection Controls\n\n7 8\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 5: Improper Considerations ...........cccssscccsssssccecessseccsssssecesessseeseessssececesssseesssssreees lo\n\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 6: All Parties Are Equal Before the Law ...........c.cccccssssscceesssseesesseeeceessecteeesssereee DD\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 7: Presumption of Innocence and Burden of Proof .........ccccccccscceseecceceeceeseeceeceee l2\nl] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span>.

The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in\n\n4 reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a\n\n5 reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.\n\n6 Reasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience,\n\n7 and your common sense. Reasonable doubt is not whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to\n\n8 avoid an unpleasant duty. Nor is it sympathy for the Defendant. The law in a criminal case is\n\n9 that it is sufficient if the guilt of the Defendant is established beyond a reasonable doubt, not\nlo beyond all possible doubt. Therefore, if, after a fair and impartial consideration of all the\nll evidence, you can candidly and honestly say that you do have an abiding belief of Ms.\nl2. Maxwell’s guilt as to any crime charged in this case, such a belief as a prudent person would be\nl3 _-willing to act upon in important maters in the personal affairs of his or her oun life, then you\nl4 have no reasonable doubt, and under such circumstances it is your duty to convict Ms. Maxwell\nl5 of the particular crime in question.\nl6 On the other hand, if after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can\nl7 candidly and honestly say that you are not satisfied with Ms. Maxwell’s guilt as to any charge,\nl8 that you do not have an abiding belief of her guilt as to that charge—in other words, if you have\nl9 such a doubt as would reasonably cause a prudent person to hesitate in acting in maters of\n2o ‘importance in his or her oun affairs—then you have a reasonable doubt, and in that circumstance\n2l ‘it is your duty to acquit Ms. Maxwell of that charge.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8634\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 97 of l67\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No.9: |The Indictment\n2 The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been formally charged in what is called an\n3 “Indictment.” As I instructed you at the outset of this trial, the Indictment is simply a charge or\n4 accusation.

Count Four relates\n2l solely to Jane and the time period l994 to l997.\n22, Count Five of the Indictment charges the Defendant with conspiring to engage in sex\n23 trafficking of individuals under the age of eighteen.

Unlike the conspiracy\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A conspiracy to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the conspiracy. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make conspiracy, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the conspiracy is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a conspiracy exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a conspiracy charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the conspiracy was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 in a conspiracy to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the conspiracy and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the conspiracy charges.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8663\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l27 of l67\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7 to\n\n5 travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\n6 The object of the conspiracy charged in Count One of the Indictment is to entice individuals\n\n7 under the age of l7 to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\n\n8 with a criminal offense.

The Southern District of New York\n\n5 encompasses the follouing counties: New York County (i.e., Manhatan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of\n\n7 those places occurs in the Southern District of New York.\n\n8 Venue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll wasanice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 ~ that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8679\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l42 of l67\n\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 43: Inferences\n\n2 During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 _ based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. _-will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23 crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo868o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l44 of l67\n\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 44: Credibility of Witnesses\n\n2 You have had the opportunity to observe the witnesses.

The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in\n\n4 reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a\n\n5 reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.\n\n6 Reasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience,\n\n7 and your common sense. Reasonable doubt is not whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to\n\n8 avoid an unpleasant duty. Nor is it sympathy for the Defendant. The law in a criminal case is\n\n9 that it is sufficient if the guilt of the Defendant is established beyond a reasonable doubt, not\nlo beyond all possible doubt.

Unlike the conspiracy\n\n4 charges, which allege agreements to commit certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on\n\n5 the actual commission of offenses, or aiding others to actually commit offenses.\n\n6 A conspiracy to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the\n\n7 substantive crime which may be the object of the conspiracy. Congress has deemed it appropriate\n\n8 to make conspiracy, standing alone, a separate crime, even if the object of the conspiracy is not\n\n9 achieved. The essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement or understanding to violate\nlo other laws. Thus, if a conspiracy exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a conspiracy charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the conspiracy was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 in a conspiracy to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the conspiracy and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient\nl8 to consider before the conspiracy charges. Therefore I will instruct you first on Counts Two,\nl9 Four, and Six, and then I will instruct you on Counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 2o of 83\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. l3: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in an Illegal Sexual Activity — The\n2 Statute\n3 The relevant statute for Count Two is Title l8, United States Code, Section 2422, which\n4 provides that “[w]hoever knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to\n5 travel in interstate .. . commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to\n6 engage in... any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,”\n7 is guilty of a federal crime.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565-~ Filed l2/l9/2l Page 2l of 83\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. l4: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — The\n2 Elements\n3 To prove the Defendant guilty of Count Two, the Government must prove each of the\n4 follouing three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n5 First, that the Defendant knouingly persuaded or induced or enticed or coerced an\n6 individual to travel in interstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment;\n7 Second, that the individual traveled in interstate commerce; and\n8 Third, that the Defendant acted with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual\n9 activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as\nlo alleged in the Indictment.\nll Count Two relates solely to Jane during the time period l994 to l997.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8727\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 22 of 83\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. l5: Count Two: Enticement to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — First\n2 Element\n3 The first element of Count Two which the government must prove beyond a reasonable\n4 doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knouingly persuaded or induced or enticed or coerced an individual\n5 to travel in interstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 45of83\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7 to\n\n5 travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\n6 The object of the conspiracy charged in Count One of the Indictment is to entice individuals\n\n7 under the age of l7 to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\n\n8 with a criminal offense.

The Southern District of New York\n\n5 encompasses the follouing counties: New York County (i.e., Manhatan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll wasanice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 ~ that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8765\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008766.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 6o of 83\n\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 43: Inferences\n\n2 During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 _ based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. _-will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23 crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565_ Filed l2/l9/2l Page 62 of 83\n\n] <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 44: Credibility of Witnesses\n\n2 You have had the opportunity to observe the witnesses.

Hou do you evaluate the credibility or believability of the witnesses? The answer\n\n5 is that you use your common sense, judgment, and experience. Common sense is your greatest\n\n6 asset as ajuror. You should ask yourselves, did the witness impress you as honest, open, and\n\n7 candid? Or did the witness appear evasive, as though the witness was trying to hide something?\n\n8 Hou responsive was the witness to the questions asked on direct examination and on cross-\n\n9 examination?

On the other hand, you may\nl3. find, because of a witness’s bearing and demeanor and based upon your consideration of all the\nl4 — other evidence in the case, that the witness is truthful.\n\nl5 Thus, there is no magic formula by which you can evaluate testimony.

You may use the same tests here that you use in your everyday lives.\nl9 You may consider the interest of any witness in the outcome of this case and any bias or\n2o prejudice of any such witness, and this is true regardless of who called or questioned the witness.\n2l Finally, as you knou, I have permited certain witnesses to be referred to in open court\n22 ~ either by their first name or a pseudonym.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to request that the Court give the jury additional\ninstructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the\nlaw applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court\nExhibit #l5).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 reads, in relevant part, as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), [i]f the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nCount Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida\nto New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would engage in one\nor more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” S2\nInd. § 2l (emphasis added).\n\nIn response to the note, the Court referred the jury to <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2l of the jury charge.\nThe defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo879o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page2of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 2\nConstructive Amendment / Variance\n\nFirst, without further <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell based on a\nconstructive amendment and/or prejudicial variance from the S2 Indictment. The Court has\nrecently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance. “To prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect\naltered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of\nthe offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been\nconvicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-\ncr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the\ndoctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a\nconstructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’ of the defendant’s constitutional rights—\ni.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou the\ngovernment proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general\nterms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms\nmay be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at\ntrial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak, l26 F.3d\nlo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)).\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo879l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page5of7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Moreover, because the same issues arise with respect to the substantive\nenticement offense charged in Count Two, the Court must give the same <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> as to Count\nTwo as well.!\n\nSupplemental Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span>\nSecond, we believe that the Court’s response to the jury note was substantively incorrect\nand prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. “A jury’s interruption of its deliberations ‘to seek further\nexplanation of the law’ is a ‘critical moment in a criminal trial’; and [the Second Circuit] therefore\nascribe[s] ‘crucial importance’ to a ‘completely accurate statement by the judge’ at that moment.”\nUnited States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d l68, l72 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (quoting United States v. Lefkouitz,\n284 F.2d 3lo, 3l4 (2d Cir. l96o)). “Instructions are erroneous if they mislead the jury as to the\ncorrect legal standard or do not adequately inform the jury of the law.” Hudson v. New York City,\n27l F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir. 2ool). Reversal is “required where, based on a review of the record as a\nwhole, the error was prejudicial or the charge was highly confusing.” Kopstein, 759 F.3d at l72;\nsee also id. (“A charge that appears likely to have left the jury ‘highly confused’ may, on that\nground alone, be reversed.” (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. One 25,9oo Square Foot More\nor Less Parcel of Land, 766 F.2d 685, 688 (2d Cir. l985) (“A charge that appears likely to have\nleft the jury ‘highly confused’ may, on that ground alone, be reversed.”))). “Even if an initial\n! The defense notes that the object of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three is a violation of the same\nNew York statute. While we do not contest that alleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of\nthose conspiracies, the jury cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on those counts without finding that she acted with the intent\nthat someone under the age of l7 would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New\nYork law.\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page6eof7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Both counts require an intent to violate New\nYork law and cannot be based on any conduct that allegedly occurred in New Mexico (or any\nother state besides New York). The court’s answer to the jury’s question permits the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on alleged conduct occurring in New Mexico—aiding\nin areturn flight from New Mexico. Not only is that conduct not charged in the indictment (see\ndiscussion above), it also is not illegal under New York law. Under New York law, an intent to\nengage in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law,\nas charged in Counts Two and Four. See People v. Carvajal, 6 N.Y.3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL\n2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise criminal jurisdiction,\nsome alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page /7 of 37\nthem with respect to only one, and only one, criminal statute - New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55. In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she experienced at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a conviction on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for conviction on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page8 of 37\n\nA. Background Facts\n\nl. Legal Instructions to the Jury\n\nThe possible bases for conviction on the Mann Act counts was an issue that came up\nrepeatedly and litigated extensively in the context of the motions in /imine, the Court’s limiting\ninstructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these occasions, the government repeatedly\nconfirmed that a conviction on the Mann Act counts could only be based on an intent to violate\nNew York law—specifically, New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55—and not any other state’s\npenal laws. Yet the government also repeatedly objected to defense efforts to clarify that point\nand ensure that the jury did not improperly consider evidence of sexual conduct that took place\noutside of New York.\n\nFor example, when the defense moved in limine to preclude Kate’s testimony on the\ngrounds that she was above the age of consent in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore her\ntestimony was not probative of the Mann Act conspiracies, the government confirmed that Ms.\nMaxwell could only be convicted on the Mann Act conspiracies based on a violation of New\nYork law:\n\nTHE COURT: ... [I]f the only evidence in the case pertained to [Kate], if all the\n\ntestimony of [Kate] is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of\n\nany crimes charged in the indictment?\n\nXK * XK\n\nMS. MOE: ...The answer is no.... With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the\n\nparticular criminal sexual activity relates to a particular statute in New York....\n\nTHE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [l3o.55] right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n* * XK\nTHE COURT: So the Mann Act ... the case that the government is going to prove\nhere is going to incorporate that as the illegal sexual conduct.\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8932\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo _ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 9of37\n\nMS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: So [Ms. Maxwell] couldn’t be convicted with respect to that count\n\n[based solely on Kate’s testimony].\n\nMS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.\n\nll/l/2o2l Tr. 67:l5-68:l9. Asa result, the Court agreed, over the objection of the government,\nto give the jury a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> before the start of Kate’s testimony which stated, among\nother things, that “any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not ‘illegal sexual\nactivity’ as the government has charged in the indictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2. The Court also\ngave a similar limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> before Annie Farmer’s testimony because she testified about\nsexual contact in New Mexico, which could not have violated New York law. Tr. 2o48:22-\n2o49:l.\n\nSimilarly, when the parties submited their proposed joint requests to charge, the defense\nrequested that the instructions for the substantive Mann Act counts specify that the government\nmust prove that Jane traveled “from Florida to New York, as charged in the Indictment,” as\nopposed to simply that Jane traveled “in interstate commerce.” Dkt. 4lo-l at l9. The defense\nhighlighted that the addition was necessary because it was expected that Jane would testify\n“about traveling to, among other places, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico” and “the elements\nshould make clear that the relevant travel for purposes of Count Two is travel from Florida to\nNew York, as alleged in the S2 Indictment.” /d. The government objected to the addition,\nstating it was unnecessary because travel to New York was already in the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment and that “there [was] no need to include words like ‘travel from Florida to New York’\n... to avoid any suggestion of a variance.” Tr. 2759:l2-276o:9. The Court agreed with the\ngovernment. The final jury charge did not specifically mention travel “to New York” and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8933\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page lo of 37\ninstead instructed the jury that the government needed to prove travel “in interstate commerce, as\nalleged in the Indictment.” Dkt. 565 at 22.\n\nThe government also objected to the defense’s request that the jury instructions for the\nMann Act conspiracy counts specify the ages of consent in the relevant jurisdictions, stating the\nfollouing: “The Government’s proposed instructions only permit the jury to convict on a\nviolation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. Accordingly, there is no reason to inform the\njury about the ages of consent in other jurisdictions.” Dkt. 4lo-l at 52 (emphasis added). The\nCourt agreed with the government and did not include this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nFinally, the defense requested that the jury charge reiterate the Court’s limiting\ninstructions for Kate and Annie Farmer in the section of the charge that addressed the violation\nof New York law. Tr. 2773:5-2774:l4. The defense also requested a separate <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in the\nsame section to address Jane’s testimony that she was sexually abused at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico when she was l5 or l6 — information that was disclosed for the first time just before\ntrial. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:6.' The defense pointed out that this conduct was not alleged in the\nIndictment and could not be a violation of New York law, and therefore the jury should be\ninstructed, similar to Kate and Annie Farmer, that this evidence could not be considered “illegal\nsexual activity” as charged in the Indictment. Tr. 2775:24-2776:4.\n\nIn responding to both requests, the government stressed that there was no risk that the\njury would convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act counts based solely on conduct that did not\nviolate New York law, such as sexual activity in New Mexico. With regard to Annie Farmer’s\ntestimony, the government stated:\n\n! According to the FBI reports of her prior interviews, Jane initially denied that she was sexually abused in New\nMexico. See 35o9-oo8 at 7-ll. Shortly before trial, after being questioned by the government on this topic, Jane\nrecalled for the first time being led to Epstein’s room in New Mexico and being sexually abused. See 35o9-o33 at l.\nShe then reiterated this in her testimony. See Tr. 323:l5-l6 (“I just remember being led to his bedroom and, you\nknou, the same thing would happen.”).\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8934\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008935.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagell of 37\n\nMR. ROHRBACH: Annie only relates to the conspiracy counts, at least as to\n\nthese Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be instructed here that the\n\nrelevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York offense. So\n\nagain, there’s no risk that the jury will think that the sexual contact that happened\n\nin New Mexico is something that on its oun is sufficient to shou the illegal\n\nsexual activity required by the statute.\nTr. 2775:2-9. With regard to Jane’s testimony, the government reiterated the same point:\n\nMR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, these instructions do not put before the jury any\n\nviolation of any New Mexico offense whatsoever above or belou the age of\n\nconsent, so I think there’s no risk that the jury is going to convict the defendant\n\nbased on their concerns about a violation of a New York offense.\nTr. 2776:5-lo. The Court agreed with the government and declined to include the requested\ninstructions. Tr. 2777:l2-25.\n\nps The Jury Note\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jury sent a note inquiring about the proper basis to convict\nunder Count Four of the Indictment (the substantive transportation count) (the “Jury Note” or the\nNote”). The Jury Note read as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Exhibit #l5 (Dkt. 593 at 23). The defense argued that the Note indicated that the jury was\nalready contemplating convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New Mexico, which was not a violation of New York law, and that their question\nfocused on whether Ms. Maxwell’s help planning Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nassuming they found she gave any, was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\nTr. 3l28:6-3l4o:l8. The Court disagreed and did not offer any clarifying instructions, and\nsimply referred the jury to the charge for the second element of Count Four.

The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.

Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v.

(cleaned up). Accordingly, the first step in evaluating\nwhether a constructive amendment has occurred is for the Court to define the “core of\ncriminality” of the crimes alleged. /d. (cleaned up). It is well setled that “the object of a\nconspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.” /d. (quoting United\nStates v. Roshko, 969 F.2d l, 5 (2d Cir. l992). Moreover, “although an indictment ‘drawn in\ngeneral terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific\nterms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct\nfacts at trial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d. (quoting United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9-lo (2d Cir. l997)). For example, specific overt acts alleged in the indictment\nmay narrou the scope of the core of criminality because they “effect the object of the [charged]\nconspiracy.” United States v. Atanasio, 87o F.2d 8o9, 8l6-l7 (2d Cir. l989) (citation omited).\nBy contrast, general factual allegations in an indictment that are not part of the specific statutory\nallegations of a particular count may not limit the core of criminality of that offense. Jd.\nSimilarly, the “essential elements” do not include “the specific means used by a defendant to\neffect his or her crime.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 422.\n\n“After identifying the core of criminality, a court must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\nconvicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l (citing D Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l).

To establish a constructive amendment, the defendant must shou that the\nevidence and jury instructions created a substantial likelihood that she was convicted for\n“behavior entirely separate from that identified in the indictment.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nThe fundamental principle of constructive amendment is clear: ““When the trial evidence\nor the jury charge operates to ‘broaden [ | the possible bases for conviction from that which\nappeared in the indictment,’ the indictment has been constructively amended.” United States v.\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (quoting United States v.

A defendant\nalleging variance must shou “substantial prejudice” to warrant reversal. /d. (cleaned up). “The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.” /d. (cleaned up).\n\nC. The “Core of Criminality” of the Mann Act Counts Was a Scheme to Entice\n\nor Cause Underaged Girls to Travel to New York with an Intent to Violate\nNew York Law.\n\nThere can be no serious dispute that the “core of criminality” of the Mann Act offenses\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment was a scheme by Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they would\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. The Indictment itself was clear on its\nface. The substantive Mann Act offenses (Counts Two and Four) specifically alleged in the “‘to\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8938\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008939.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l5 of 37\nwit” clauses that the charges were based on Jane’s travel “from Florida to New York, New\nYork” where Ms. Maxwell intended for her to engage in sex acts with Epstein “in violation of\nNew York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. 4 l5,2l. The Mann Act conspiracy counts\n(Counts One and Three) alleged generally that the object of the conspiracies was to entice or\ncause underage girls to travel across state lines with the intent that they “engage in sexual\nactivity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” Ind. J l2, l8. Houever,\neach count specified in the overt acts that the relevant criminal offense was a “violation of New\nYork Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” Ind. {fj l3b, l9b. See Atanasio, 87o F.2d at 8l6 (overt acts\ncan narrou the core of criminality of a conspiracy offense); Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o\n(“[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general terms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality,\nan indictment that is drawn in specific terms may be read to specify a narrouer set of facts[.]”\n(quoting Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo9-lo)).\n\nEven more important than the language of the Indictment were the government’s oun\nstatements to the Court about the scope of the Mann Act counts. As set forth above, the\ngovernment consistently represented to the Court, in numerous conferences and filings, that a\nconviction under the Mann Act counts had to be based on an intent or an agreement to violate\nNew York law, specifically New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. See, e.g., ll/l/2o2l Tr. 68:2-\n4 (“With respect to the Mann Act conspiracies, the particular criminal sexual activity relates to a\nparticular statute in New York.”); Dkt. 4lo-l at 52 (“The Government’s proposed instructions\nonly permit the jury to convict on a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55.” (emphasis\nadded)); Tr. 2775:3-6 (“[A]t least as to these Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be\ninstructed here that the relevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York\noffense.”).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8939\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008940.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l6 of 37\nThe government therefore affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of\ncriminality” of the Mann Act offenses was a scheme to cause underaged girls to travel to New\nYork to engage in sexual activity that violated New York law. It follous, then, that evidence that\nan underaged girl traveled to any other state besides New York and engaged in sexual activity\nthat was illegal under that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of\nthe Mann Act counts.” If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on the Mann Act counts based solely on\nsuch conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See\nMillstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the\npossible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the indictment has\nbeen constructively amended.” (cleaned up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive amendment found\nwhen defendant was convicted of misbranding drugs on an entirely distinct misbranding theory\nthan the one charged in the indictment); Wozniak, l26 F.3d at lo6-o8 (constructive amendment\nfound when defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and\nmethamphetamines, but the proof at trial shoued possession with intent to distribute marijuana);\nRoshko, 969 F.2d at 4-6 (constructive amendment found when defendant was charged with a\nconspiracy to change the immigration status of an alien, but the proof at trial related to a\nconspiracy with an entirely distinct object).\nD. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three\nof the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct Not Charged in the Indictment.\nYet there is a substantial likelihood that this is exactly what happened in this case: Jane’s\ntestimony about sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico, which did not violate New York\nlaw, combined with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury\n? Engaging in sexual activity in any other state cannot form the basis for a violation of New York law. See People v.\nCarvajal, 6 N.Y .3d 3o5, 3l2 (2oo5) (“CPL 2o.2o[] has codified the general principle that, for New York to exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the state.”).\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagel7 of 37\nadditional clarifying instructions in response to the Jury Note, constructively amended the\nIndictment and alloued the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on three of the four Mann Act counts\nbased on “distinctly different” crimes than those charged in the Indictment. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2l (“After identifying the core of criminality, a court must then determine whether\nthe evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was\nnot convicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the\none alleged.” (citing D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l)).\n\nCount Four of the Indictment, which was the subject of the Jury Note, charged Ms.\nMaxwell with the substantive offense of transporting an underaged individual in interstate\ncommerce with the intent that the individual engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense. Ind. § 2l. The “to wit” clause of Count Four specified that the\nunderaged individual was Jane, the transportation in interstate commerce was Jane’s travel “from\nFlorida to New York, New York,” and the illegal sexual activity was a violation of New York\nPenal Law, Section l3o.55. Id.\n\nPursuant to the Court’s practice, the jurors were not given the Indictment. The jury\ncharge, which was given to the jury, included most, but not all, of these allegations. The jury\ncharge specified that Count Four related “solely to Jane” and instructed the jury that to convict\non this count, the government had to prove that (l) Ms. Maxwell knouingly transported Jane “in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment”; (2) Ms. Maxwell did so with the intent that\nJane would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55; and\n(3) Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was under the age of l7 years old. Dkt. 565 at 26-29. The jury\ncharge did not include, houever, that the relevant interstate travel “as charged in the Indictment”\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo894l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 2o of 37\nNew Mexico trip to see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question\nposed by the Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Ms. Maxwell on the substantive\nenticement offense (Count Two). The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip. Hence, the acquital on Count\nTwo. By contrast, the jury likely believed that if they found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in\narranging Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place,\nthey could convict her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that\narranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four. Hence, the\nquestion in the Jury Note.\n\nRegardless, it is clear from the Jury Note that the jurors were deliberating with a mistaken\nunderstanding of the law — namely, that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of\nCount Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in\nNew Mexico, without finding any intent to violate New York law. The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York. It was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for conviction under Count\nFour.

D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l.\n\nMoreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count\nFour based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a substantial likelihood that they\nimproperly convicted her on the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) based on\nthe same conduct. The substantive transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object\nof the conspiracy charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to\nviolate New York law. See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *23 (citing examples where the Second\nCircuit found a constructive amendment “where the district court either refused to give a limiting\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> defining the scope of a conspiracy or relevance of certain evidence, or where it gave\nan <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> defining the conspiracy too broadly”).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwere based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses. The Court must vacate these\nconvictions and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nE. The Variance Between the Proof at Trial and the Allegations in the\n\nIndictment Substantially Prejudiced Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court must vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts One,\nThree, and Four because the record demonstrates a variance between the proof at trial and the\nallegations in the Indictment that substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell. See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *3l (cleaned up) (“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\nleft unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment” which causes “substantial prejudice” to the defendant).\n\nHere, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning Jane’s sexual\nabuse in New Mexico. Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 22 of 37\nMexico, she had denied being sexually abused there. It was not until just before trial, after the\ngovernment had questioned her about the New Mexico trip in her preparation for trial, that Jane\nclaimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at\nthe ranch. See supra note l.\n\nJane’s new recollection about the New Mexico trip was disclosed at the eleventh hour\nand substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her defense. See id. (“The\ndetermination of whether a variance between an indictment and the proof at trial is prejudicial\nturns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that indictments exist to\nprotect—to inform an accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and\nto avoid double jeopardy.”). Because the Mann Act counts as charged in the Indictment were\nbased on a violation of New York law, the defense vigorously litigated the extent to which the\ngovernment could introduce evidence of sexual activity that occurred in jurisdictions outside of\nNew York in support of the Mann Act counts. As part of that effort, the defense requested\nlimiting instructions with respect to the testimony of Kate and Annie Farmer. The limiting\ninstructions, which were read to the jury immediately before the witnesses began their testimony,\nspecifically instructed the jury that any sexual conduct that Kate or Annie Farmer said occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein “was not ‘illegal sexual activity’ as the government has charged in the\nindictment.” Tr. ll67:23-ll68:2; Tr. 2o48:22-2o49:l.\n\nHad the defense been given sufficient notice that Jane would testify that she was sexually\nabused in New Mexico, we would have litigated this issue before trial and, at the very least,\nmade an application to the Court to give a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> before the start of Jane’s testimony\nsimilar to the one given for Annie Farmer, who also testified about a single instance of sexual\ncontact at the ranch in New Mexico when she was l6 years old, which could not have violated\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law.

See Wozniak, l26 F.3d at llo (vacating conviction for\nconstructive amendment because the defense was not aware that the government would elicit\nevidence of marijuana distribution and may have modified its defense strategy had it knoun).\n\nInstead, the only option left to the defense after Jane’s testimony was to request a similar\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in the jury charge, which the Court denied. Tr. 2775:l4-2777:25. The Court further\ndenied the defense’s request for a clarifying <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in response to the Jury Note, which made\nclear that the jury had likely done exactly what the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would have prevented —\nnamely, concluded that Jane’s sexual abuse in New Mexico could constitute the “illegal sexual\nactivity” charged in the Indictment, even though it did not violate New York law. This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion.

Nevertheless, assuming this\nCourt concludes that Ms. Maxwell must prove Juror No. 5o intentionally misled the\nCourt in falsely answering Questions 25 and 48, Ms. Maxwell has easily met that burden.\n\nThere are at least six reasons to believe Juror No. 5o acted intentionally.

The questionnaire instructed potential\njurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the\nquestionnaire. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court.

In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25).

Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 24 of 49\nthat must be folloued,” but a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are\nselected to sit on this case, will you be able to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented at\nthe trial and in the context of the law as I will give it to you in my instructions, disregarding any\nother ideas, notions, or beliefs about the law that you may have encountered in reaching your\nverdict?” Id. at 43-44.\n\nWith respect to Juror 5o, the defendant has presented no evidence to support a claim of\nactual bias. In a public interview, Juror 5o stated that he “went into the trial firmly believing that\nMaxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye” and that\nhis oun experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until\nproven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 2, 8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with\nwhich the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony and other evidence in numerous\nquestions submited over the course of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return of a split\nverdict, in which it acquited the defendant on one count. See United States v. Aiello, 77l F.2d\n62l, 63l (2d Cir. l985) (citing apparent care with which jury approached deliberations and split\nverdict as evidence of impartiality); Greer, 285 F.3d at l74 (citing split verdict as evidence of\nimpartiality). And Juror 5o’s public statements are further corroborated by his answers during voir\ndire, during which he unequivocally stated that he would be able to follou the law as instructed\nby the Court, that he would decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence,\npresented in court, and that, other than what he had been asked, there was no reason to think he\ncould not be fair and impartial. See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nWhile the defendant has not argued for a finding of actual bias (Def. Mem. at 38-39), she\nat times alludes to the argument. For example, the defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o\ncalled the defendant a “predator,” said the verdict was for “all the victims,” and commented on a\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009182.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MasihtexwellD @Ceays Cvitefich Deminced kad dhe WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ba (onthe\nISEMENT —_ Scoty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim.

Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page6of5l\ncrime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of hou a defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at\n*2o. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.”\nId. Houever, text in an indictment, such as “factual allegations that do not prove essential\nelements of a charge” and “general factual allegations leading into the statutory allegations” are\nnot limitations on the core of criminality alleged in an indictment. /d.\n\nOnce a court identifies the core of criminality, the court “must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\nconvicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Jd. The Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof,\nprovided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”\nLebedev, 932 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply shou that the facts diverged\ngreatly from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions\ncreated a substantial likelihood that a defendant was convicted for behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l; see United States v. McGinn,\n787 F.3d ll6, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“[T]he proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica\nof the charges contained in an indictment... .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made clear that a\nconstructive amendment does not occur where the facts at trial involve not a ‘distinctly different\ncomplex set of uncharged facts’ but ‘a single set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the\nindictment.’” /d. (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l9 (2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\n“Tn contrast to a constructive amendment, a variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of5l\nfrom those alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l. Reversal due to a\nvariance is appropriate only when the defendant can establish “that substantial prejudice occurred\nat trial as a result of the variance,” a shouing that cannot be made “where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character that could have misled the\ndefendant at trial, and where the variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294. “The\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly held that, so long as a defendant receives notice of the Government’s\ntheory of the case before trial, he is not prejudiced by a variance.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\nra,\nB. Discussion\n\nNo constructive amendment or variance occurred in this case. The grand jury returned the\nS2 Indictment charging the defendant with knouingly transporting Jane with the intent that Jane\nengage in criminal sexual activity in New York, and aiding and abeting the same, and with\nconspiring to entice and transport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York. That is the core of criminality charged in the S2\nIndictment, and it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury\ninstructions.\n\nl. The Proof at Trial and Jury Instructions Captured the Core of Criminality\n\nThe defendant argues that the core of criminality for the Mann Act counts “was a scheme\nby Epstein and [the defendant] to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the\nintent that they would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.” (Def. Mot. at 9).\nThat is precisely the theory the Government advanced at trial. As the defendant correctly states,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof5l\n\nThe Court’s Mann Act jury instructions also permited the jury to determine only whether\nthe defendant had intended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the conspiracy victims were\nintended to engage in sexual activity in New York. During trial, the Court granted defense requests\nfor limiting instructions at the time evidence came in to avoid the precise concern the defendant\nnou articulates. (Tr. ll67-68 (Kate); 2o48-49 (Annie)). See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *27\n(explaining that the Court identified no case “in which the Second Circuit has ever found a\nconstructive amendment when a district court issued limiting instructions properly defining the\nscope of the alleged crime”). And at the conclusion of trial, the Court explained that Count Two\nalleged that the defendant “enticed Jane to travel across state lines with the intent that she would\nengage in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the penal law of\nNew York State.” (Tr. 3o34; see Tr. 3o3l (describing the third element of Count Two to require\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). Similarly, the Court\nexplained that Count Four alleged that the defendant knouingly transported Jane “‘with the intent\nthat Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in\nviolation of New York law.” (Tr. 3o37; see Tr. 3o35 (describing the second element of Count\nFour to require proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). For\nboth Counts, the Court specifically instructed the jury on one and only one predicate state offense:\na violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. (Tr. 3o34, 3o37). The instructions on Counts\nOne and Three incorporated this discussion of the elements of Counts Two and Four, and the only\nstatute the Court identified in its discussion of the relevant overt acts was New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. (Tr. 3o49-5o, 3o56-57).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9572\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof5l\n2. There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury Convicted The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive amendment or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and convicted\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat conclusion. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law. The jury was not informed of the age of consent in New Mexico or any\nparticular criminal statute in New Mexico. The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52). Such an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would have\nprovided the jury some state law to compare to the facts and determine whether it was violated,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9573\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel2of5l\nof these provide any likelihood, much less a substantial likelihood, that the jury convicted the\ndefendant solely because she intended for Jane to be sexually abused in New Mexico.\na. Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico\n\nJane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any\nconstructive amendment argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,\nthe evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act\ncounts. (Tr. 3l49-5o; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.l (stating that the defense does “not contest that\nalleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]\nconspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knouledge that Epstein was\nhaving sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while\ntraveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating\nthe abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent\nwith the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive amendment.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.\nApp’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l); see Gross, 2o2l WL 4685ll, at *28 (noting that if the jury\ndetermined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different conspiracy, the jury\ninstructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other conspiracy”). Indeed, that\nevidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of\nAnnie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of\nenhancing the risk of conviction based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to\nviolate New York law.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of5l\nconviction outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied\nby a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.\n\nb. The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of5l\n\nTwo. (Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no relevance.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “irrelevant,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that’s why precisely\nwe sent them back to the charge.” (Tr. 3l54).\n\nThe defendant renews her arguments nou, urging that the jury note shous that “the jurors\nhad the mistaken impression that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8of5l\nthe scope of accomplice liability, and specifically, whether the defendant is culpable for all conduct\nrelated to a trip even if her role was limited to arranging the return flight. Indeed, the defendant’s\ncurrent understanding of the note’s question was not her initial view, which triggered the defense\nto repeatedly request an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> about the “purpose of the travel.” (Tr. 3l38; see Tr. 3l3l\n(requesting that the Court direct the jury’s atention to the requirement that illegal activity was a\n“significant and motivating purpose” of the travel)).\n\nIt is therefore too difficult to parse the note into a particular set of facts and a question\nabout those facts. The defendant’s contrary understanding is brimming with speculation. The\ndefendant presumes that the jury note indicates that the jurors “decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped arrange, any of Jane’s trips to\nNew York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her trip to\nNew Mexico,” so “the jury began evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip\nto see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question posed by the jury\nnote.” (Def. Mot. at l4-l5). Nothing in the note explains why the jury was asking the question it\ndid. Indeed, it would be odd for the jury to reject all of Jane’s testimony about travel to New York\nand the ensuing sexual abuse in New York for lack of corroboration, and then conclude that the\ndefendant arranged an unidentified commercial return flight for which there is no specific evidence\nin the record, including no specific corroboration of the defendant’s role in arranging that flight.\n(See Tr. 3l33 (defense argument that there is “no evidence” the defendant arranged a return flight\nfrom New Mexico)). And there is no reason the jury would have rejected Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse in New York due to lack of corroboration, even though a flight record shous she was\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo958o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2lof5l\n“almost invariable assumption of the law . . . that jurors follou their instructions”). Accordingly,\neven if the jury note suggests some confusion, the Court’s response did not constructively amend\nthe S2 Indictment. See Jones, 847 F. App’x at 3o (finding no constructive amendment in a sex\ntrafficking case where the indictment did not contain the verb “advertise” but the evidence included\nevidence of advertising and the Court mistakenly used that verb in parts of the instructions, because\nthe advertising evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and the Court otherwise\ncorrectly instructed the jury); Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“The jury instructions described a\nconspiracy substantially the same as the one charged in the indictment.”).\n\nThird, the defendant’s argument is beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to\nthe jury note or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment\nargument. See, e.g., United States v. Muraca, 8o3 F. Appx’ 545, 546 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“[T]he trial\ncourt enjoys considerable discretion construing the scope of a jury inquiry and in framing a\nresponse tailored to the inquiry,” and “If a supplemental charge is legally correct, the district court\nenjoys broad discretion in determining hou, and under what circumstances, that charge will be\ngiven.”). Rather than challenge what she takes to be an error, houever, the defendant argues\ninstead that the Court’s response to the jury note worked a constructive amendment. In so doing,\nthe defendant must surmount the high bar of shouing that, notwithstanding the focus of the trial\nevidence, the Court’s limiting instructions at trial, and the Court’s jury instructions taken as a\nwhole, the Court’s response to the jury note “so modified] essential elements of the offense that\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other\nthan that charged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o. The original instructions\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 22 of 5l\ndid not modify any essential element of the offense or permit conviction based on an entirely\ndifferent theory. Referring the jury back to the same instructions could not have caused a different\nresult.\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann Act offenses with an intent to engage\nin sexual activity in violation of a New York statute. The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v. Milstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 66 (2d\nCir. 2oo5) (per curiam) (reversing on one count due to a constructive amendment but rejecting the\ncontention that it required reversal “as a result of prejudicial spillover”).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 23 oof5l\n\n3. No Variance Occurred\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred at trial. The evidence at trial did not prove any\nfacts materially different from those alleged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. See\nGross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l (explaining that a variance occurs when “the evidence offered\nat trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment”). The S2 Indictment\nalleged that the defendant was Epstein’s close associate and co-conspirator who groomed minor\nvictims, including Jane between in or about l994 and in or about l997, and that the defendant and\nEpstein groomed minor victims for abuse in various places, including Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico. (See S2 Indictment 4] 5, 9, l3). That is exactly what the Government proved at trial. It\nwas no variance that the S2 Indictment did not specifically allege that Jane was abused in New\nMexico—especially where, as here, that fact was offered as evidence of the conduct charged in the\nS2 Indictment, but was not by itself sufficient to convict the defendant. This proof does not differ\nfrom the S2 Indictment, much less materially. Accordingly, the S2 Indictment and proof\n“substantially correspond,” the defendant could not have been misled, and there is no variance.\nKhalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294.\n\nThe defendant argues that she was prejudiced because Jane recalled that she was abused\nduring her New Mexico trip shortly before trial, which prevented the defendant from filing a\nmotion to preclude the testimony or giving a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> before Jane’s testimony. (Def.\nMot. at l6-l8). This argument is belied by the record. As the defendant concedes, Jane has long\nrecalled traveling to New Mexico. (/d. at l6-l7). The defendant therefore had “fair and adequate\nnotice” that the Mann Act conspiracies included conduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 24 of5l\n\nis all that is required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 622 (2d Cir. 2oo3). And in any\nevent, Jane recalled the incident of abuse at least as early as November 3, 2o2l. (See Def. Mot. at\n5 n.l (citing 35o9-o33 at l)). Notes from that interview were provided to the defense on November\n6, 2o2l—more than three weeks before trial. At the time, the parties were still litigating whether\nKate could testify at all. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 4l7 (order dated November 6, 2o2l, requiring the\nGovernment to brief whether Kate was a “victim” for any legal purpose, including restitution)).\nThe Court did not permit Kate to testify until November l9, 2o2l—almost two weeks after the\ndefendant received the relevant notes. (Dkt. No. 477). And follouing that decision, the parties\ncontinued to litigate the limiting instructions for Kate and Annie in advance of trial. (See, e.g.,\nll/23/2l Tr. at 28-38).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant had ample notice to seek a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> as to this portion\nof Jane’s testimony. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“rejecting a prejudice argument in part because\n“t]he government disclosed the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). The Court’s\nfailure to give one sua sponte is not a prejudicial variance. The defendant is simply characterizing\nher failure to ask for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> at the time of Jane’s testimony as an argument that she\nwas prejudiced. To the contrary, the Court did not err—much less plainly so. See United States\nv. Petit, l9 Cr. 85o (JSR), 2o2l WL 67346l, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2l, 2o2l) (applying the plain\nerror standard to a constructive amendment claim in a Rule 33 motion that was not made at trial).\n\nFinally, even if the defendant had been entitled to a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> but was deprived\nof the opportunity to request it, she still was not prejudiced. As the Court agreed at the charge\nconference, although the Court gave the limiting instructions for Annie and Kate, there was no\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 25of5l\nneed to repeat those instructions in the context of the full charge, which clarified that “the violation\nof law is as charged in New York.” (Tr. 2774-75, 2777). And the fact that the defense failed to\nseek or receive a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> before Jane’s testimony did not provide a separate basis for\nincluding a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in the final charge. (Tr. 2777). The Court, the Government, and\nthe defense were painstaking during trial to ensure that the jury understood that the Mann Act\ncounts required an intent to commit a criminal sexual act in New York. That the defense missed\nan additional opportunity for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is not a prejudicial variance, much less a\nconstructive amendment.\nI. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Counts Three and Five\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged three conspiracies under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Counts One and\nThree were predicated on two different provisions of the Mann Act, whereas Count Five charged\na conspiracy based on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. As the Court held in an April l6,\n2o2l Order, the Government was entitled to present these three different counts to the jury. (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 27). Follouing the verdict, houever, the Government agrees that the Court should enter\njudgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the similarities between those\ncounts. Accordingly, of the three conspiracy counts charged in the S2 Indictment, the Government\nsubmits that the Court should enter judgment on Count Three, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2423(a), and Count Five, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nCounts Three and Five are not multiplicitous, and the Court should enter judgment on both\ncounts. In particular, as discussed in greater detail belou, Counts Three and Five arose from\ndifferent criminal schemes, involving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates,\nand a different modus operandi.

Juror No. 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 were intentionally false.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not need to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire answers were\nintentionally false.

Nevertheless, assuming this\nCourt concludes that Ms. Maxwell must prove Juror No. 5o intentionally misled the\nCourt in falsely answering Questions 25 and 48, Ms. Maxwell has easily met that burden.\n\nThere are at least six reasons to believe Juror No. 5o acted intentionally. First, this\nCourt need only watch the video of Juror No. 5o being confronted with his false answers\nto appreciate that he acted intentionally.

Unable to\ncredibly explain away his false answer, Juror No. 5o eventually put together a\nnonsensical response: “No, No! I knou my face is red because I can feel the blood but, I\nhonestly—that’s why I answered it that way.”\n\nSecond, Juror No. 5o’s atempt to justify his false answer by claiming he “flew\nthrough” the questionnaire is not worthy of belief. The questionnaire instructed potential\njurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the\nquestionnaire. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 5o heeded these instructions.\nIndeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 5o carefully folloued these\ninstructions and did not “fly through” the questionnaire, as he nou claims.

Juror No. 5o said he did remember the questionnaire’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the questionnaire itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and impartial. Ex. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”).

In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25).

Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 24 of 49\nthat must be folloued,” but a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are\nselected to sit on this case, will you be able to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented at\nthe trial and in the context of the law as I will give it to you in my instructions, disregarding any\nother ideas, notions, or beliefs about the law that you may have encountered in reaching your\nverdict?” Id. at 43-44.\n\nWith respect to Juror 5o, the defendant has presented no evidence to support a claim of\nactual bias. In a public interview, Juror 5o stated that he “went into the trial firmly believing that\nMaxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye” and that\nhis oun experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until\nproven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 2, 8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with\nwhich the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony and other evidence in numerous\nquestions submited over the course of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return of a split\nverdict, in which it acquited the defendant on one count. See United States v. Aiello, 77l F.2d\n62l, 63l (2d Cir. l985) (citing apparent care with which jury approached deliberations and split\nverdict as evidence of impartiality); Greer, 285 F.3d at l74 (citing split verdict as evidence of\nimpartiality). And Juror 5o’s public statements are further corroborated by his answers during voir\ndire, during which he unequivocally stated that he would be able to follou the law as instructed\nby the Court, that he would decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence,\npresented in court, and that, other than what he had been asked, there was no reason to think he\ncould not be fair and impartial. See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nWhile the defendant has not argued for a finding of actual bias (Def. Mem. at 38-39), she\nat times alludes to the argument. For example, the defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o\ncalled the defendant a “predator,” said the verdict was for “all the victims,” and commented on a\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9822\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d.

The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage.

Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009861.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihexwellD @Ceays evitlefind Beainced kad de Wd A2predatdr ADpay Ba fone\nISEMENT —_ Scoty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool). Therefore, judges should “impose sanctions on lawyers for their mode of advocacy only ’\n\nin the most egregious situations, lest lawyers be deterred from vigorous representation of\n\ntheir clients.” Id.

To\non suggest that the jury could not find or infer that he knew\nl2 exactly why these transactions were being effectuated, not for\nl.3 any real investment reason, not because they had figured out\nl4 that in February and March, the year after the transactions had\nl5 been done, that somehou it would have been a beter investment\nl6 to have not invested in Cisco stock, but instead to have\niq invested in foreign currency. To suggest that the jury could\nl8 not have found that Mr. Parse knew that the reason that these\nl9 were being done was to effectuate tax losses for the prior year\n2o is simply ludicrous.\n2l Your Honor, the defendant was faxed information\n22 relating to the tax returns themselves, This wasn't just a\n23 one-way street between David Parse's office and Jenkins &\n24 Gilchrist, but it was at least a two-way street between\n23 Deutsche Bank and Jenkins & Gilchrist and also the accountants.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010179.jpg": "CaSes i2o2 Or OCs AS NL lesa Wa -<,), Y alienemmmeemaneaialadeeiataiall\n22\nCAC3PARC\nL transactions that had to be done by the end of the year, that\n2 had been done by the end of the year, pursuant to instructions\n3 that had been given by Jenkins & Gilchrist to Deutsche Bank,\n4 had been implemented properly by Mr. Parse in the first\n25 instance, and nou were being requested to redo them to achieve\n6 a different result.\nij This I think is a distinction that makes\n8 Mr, Shechtman's example of the broker's mistake an apple to our\n9 orange or an orange to our apple, which is that this is not an\nlo instance where Mr. Parse takes an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from a client and\nae screws it up.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page6of24\nthat [Ms. Maxwell] was not convicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime\n‘distinctly different’ from the one alleged.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7). In other words, the dispute is whether there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Counts One, Three, and Four\nwithout finding that she intended Jane and the other victims to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork in violation of New York law, and instead convicted her of a “distinctly different” crime\nbased on a finding that she intended the illegal sexual activity to occur in New Mexico.\n\nBased on a plain reading of the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5), it is substantially likely\nthat this is exactly what happened in this case. The government once again confidently states\nthat there is “no likelihood” that this could have occurred because the government never argued\nthis as a theory of guilt and the jury instructions required the jury to find that Ms. Maxwell\nintended to violate New York law. (Opp. at lo). But that argument misses the mark entirely.\nRegardless of what the government did or did not argue in its summation, or what the jury\ninstructions did or did not say about the intent requirement for Count Four, the Jury Note laid\nbare that the jury was confused about that element and had the mistaken belief that if it found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and the other\nelements of Count Four were satisfied, it could convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without\nfinding that she intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New York.\n\nAt that point, it was incumbent on the Court to correct the jury’s misunderstanding of an\nessential element of the offense with a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, as the defense requested. See\nBollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 6o7, 6l2-l3 (l946) (When “a jury makes explicit its\ndifficulties [through a writen inquiry,] a trial judge should clear them away with concrete\naccuracy”); United States v.

The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive amendment and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it concluded that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8of24\nUnder the second element of Count Four, can the defendant be found guilty if the\ndefendant’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico and if\nthe defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nbut not the flight to New Mexico?\n\nHence, the question posed by the Jury Note contained two parts. The jury wanted to knou if it\nwas sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if it found (l) that Ms. Maxwell’s\nintent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell\nassisted with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not sufficient to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof necessary to satisfy Count Four. As\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of24\na result, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased on a constructive amendment of the crime charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to muddy the common sense reading of the Jury\nNote by focusing on peripheral or irrelevant issues, or by mischaracterizing the text of the Note,\nor even by inserting words, phrases, and punctuation that are not contained in the Note, in an\neffort to confuse and complicate the analysis. (Opp. at l5-l7). This is nothing more than\nmisdirection and should be rejected.\n\nFor example, the government asserts that Jane’s testimony concerning the New Mexico\nconduct was proper and relevant to the jury’s consideration of the Mann Act counts, and that the\njury “could have convicted even if no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it\nconcluded that the defendant intended for abuse to occur in New York.” (Opp. at ll-l2\n(emphasis in original)). The Court itself raised this same point in declining to give the jury the\nrequested supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. (Tr. 3l49-5o). Ms. Maxwell does not dispute either\nassertion. But that is not the issue raised by the Jury Note. In fact, the Jury Note makes clear\nthat the jury was considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without concluding that she\nintended for Jane to be abused in New York. The question posed in the Jury Note was whether\nMs. Maxwell could “be found guilty” under the second element of Count Four (to use the jury’s\noun words) if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\nin New Mexico. (Court Exhibit #l5). In other words, the jury was asking whether they could\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on that intent, and that intent alone. The answer to\nthat question is no, and the jury should have been so instructed to prevent a constructive\namendment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagellof 24\nnote asking a similar question about Annie Farmer’s testimony. See Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can we\nconsider Annie’s testimony as conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But\nthe Jury Note did not say that, nor did it contain the phrase “in part.” Instead, the Jury Note\nasked a much more specific question about whether the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four if it found that she (l) intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico\nand (2) aided with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. The\ngovernment’s speculation about what the jury may have meant cannot alter the clear text and\nmeaning of the Jury Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the intent\nrequirement necessary for Count Four and needed to be given a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to\nremedy the confusion.?\n\nB. The Court Erred When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> Clarifying the Intent Requirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court further erred when it declined to give the jury a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, as\nrequested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement for Count Four — namely, that the\ngovernment had to prove that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. The Jury Note shoued not only that the jury had a mistaken understanding of the law\nconcerming intent, but also indicated that the jury might convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. At that point, it was the\nresponsibility of the Court to give the jury a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> “to enable it to assess the\nevidence within the proper legal framework and to reach a rational verdict” and to avoid a\nconstructive amendment of the charges. Parker, 9o3 F.2d at lol; see also Gross, 2ol7 WL\n3 The government chides the defense for engaging in speculation about what the jury may have been thinking before\nsending the Jury Note. (Opp. l7-l9). The defense engaged in that discussion to explain why the proof at trial may\nhave led the jury to focus on Jane’s testimony about the conduct in New Mexico with respect to Count Four. But the\nCourt need not rely on that analysis. The Jury Note speaks for itself. The jury was focused on Jane’s abuse in New\nMexico and misunderstood the intent requirement necessary to convict under Count Four.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 24\n4685ll, at *23 (“[T]he Second Circuit has emphasized the pouer of limiting instructions to\nprevent constructive amendment[.]” (emphasis in original)). By declining to provide a\nsupplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the Court created “a substantial likelihood” that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of crimes “distinctly different” from the ones alleged. Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\n*2l; see also Millstein, 4ol F.3d at 65 (“When the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to\nbroaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment, the\nindictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)).\n\nThe government argues that any confusion the jury may have had on the issue of intent\nwas ameliorated by the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the existing <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on the second\nelement of Count Four. (Opp. at l9). According to that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the government had to prove\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law” and further specified that the\nrelevant criminal offense was a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55. (Instr. No.\n2l). The government contends that the jury could not have misunderstood the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nbecause it did not mention New Mexico at all and only mentioned an intent to engage in sexual\nactivity that violated New York law. (Opp. at l9-2o).\n\nThe government’s confidence, houever, is belied by the Jury Note, which indicates that\nthe jury thought it could potentially convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four if it found that she\nintended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. And it is not hard to see where\nthis confusion came from. Although the jury instructions state that the jury needed to find that\nMs. Maxwell intended “that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” nouhere in the jury instructions does it\nstate that a violation of New York law, or specifically a violation of Section l3o.55, must occur\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel4 of 24\nCourt’s error was compounded by its earlier refusal to instruct the jury that Jane’s sexual abuse\nin New Mexico could not be considered “illegal sexual activity” as charged in the Indictment\nbecause it was not a violation of New York law, as it had instructed with regard to Kate and\nAnnie Farmer’s testimony. (Tr. 2775-77). As a result, the jury instructions were insufficient to\nproperly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial likelihood that Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of a crime other than the one alleged in the Indictment. Moreover, because the Mann\nAct conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) required an identical finding of intent, there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that the jury improperly convicted Ms. Maxwell on those counts based on\nthe same conduct. Accordingly, the Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts\nOne, Three, and Four, and grant a new trial on these counts.\n\nIl. All Three Conspiracy Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based on a\n\nSingle Underlying Criminal Scheme.\n\nThe government concedes in its Opposition that the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three are so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should only\nenter judgment as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24) (“[T]he Government agrees that the\nCourt should enter judgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the\nsimilarities between those counts.”). The government maintains, houever, that the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five is not multiplicitous and that the Court should enter\njudgment on Counts Three and Five because they “arose from different criminal schemes,\ninvolving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and a different modus\noperandi.” (Opp. at 24).\n\nThe government’s atempt to separate and distinguish the conspiracies charged in Counts\nThree and Five is directly contrary to its theory of prosecution and the proof at trial, and flies in\nthe face of the arguments the government made to the jury. The government never framed these\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page5ofl6\nintended to mislead the Court while completing his jury questionnaire or during voir dire. Juror\n5o testified under oath that he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he\nhas] ever made in [his] life.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:23-24). On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen questionnaire, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2). The questionnaire\nand the process by which Juror 5o completed the questionnaire “must be viewed in context.”\nUnited States v. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2 (WKS), 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4).\nJuror 5o’s description of the process of completing the questionnaire on November 4, 2o2l\ncredibly explained hou he came to make unintentional mistakes on the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\nquestionnaire was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page lo of l6\nwas being considered for as a juror when he went into jury selection and only learned after siting\nin the courtroom for three hours.

He further explained that he\n“honestly never thought [he] would be chosen to sit on this jury” because of the “sheer volume of\npeople” present for jury selection; he thought “surely they will be interviewing thousands of\npeople. And they ultimately choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I would be\none of those twelve.” (/d. at l2:3-4, l3:l8-25).\n\nThe hearing held by this Court made clear that Juror 5o did not deliberately lie or engage\nin deceit in completing the questionnaire. Juror 5o made an “honest mistake.” (/d. at 23:5). The\ndefendant’s motion fails at the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nB. The Record Does Not Support a Finding that the Court Would Have\n\nGranted a Hypothetical for Cause Challenge\n\nThe hearing established that Juror 5o harbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case based on the evidence and the Court’s legal\ninstructions. If Juror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating to sexual abuse in the\nquestionnaire, the Court would have asked Juror 5o follou up questions during voir dire to\ndetermine if it would have granted a challenge for cause. The Court asked those questions at the\nhearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made clear that he was a fair and impartial juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been excused for cause. Because the defendant cannot\nestablish that Juror 5o was biased, she is not entitled to the extraordinary relief she seeks.\nprospective juror would agree that, if required to serve on a jury, they would rather do so on an\ninteresting case, and surely many prospective jurors would find this case more interesting than a\ncontract dispute or the like. But as Juror 5o made clear repeatedly, including twice in that same\ncolloquy, he “did not set out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at l4:4-5). Were he atempting to\nlie or mislead the Court, he surely would have omited that comment and left his answer at “I did\nnot hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at l4:2). Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,\ndemonstrating his candor at the hearing—including his candor that he made no effort to be selected\nas a juror.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l2 of l6\n\nhis ability to render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial and the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law, and that “[a]bsolutely in no way” would his experience with prior sexual\nabuse interfere with his ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. (/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)). At worst, Juror 5o’s expectations about\nthe consequences of his interviews reflect naivety; they do not reflect deception.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l3 of l6\nsexual assault. In each case, during voir dire, each juror affirmed to the Court that he or she could\nbe fair and impartial. Not only did the Court not strike each of those eight jurors for cause, but\nneither party even moved to do so on these grounds. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 4-6, 2o). Thus, if Juror\n5o had disclosed his history of sexual abuse in the writen questionnaire, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, but would have instead asked additional follou-up\nquestions. Juror 5o’s answers to the follou-up questions, as given at the hearing, shoued that he\ncould be fair and impartial notwithstanding his prior experience.\n\nThe defendant cannot demonstrate that Juror 5o was biased. At the hearing, Juror 5o\nrepeatedly denied that he harbored any bias or feelings one way or another with respect to the\ndefendant or the Government.

To the contrary, Juror\n5o consistently testified that he was fair and impartial in this case and that he rendered a verdict\nconsistent with the evidence and the Court’s instructions of law.> That testimony is consistent\nwith Juror 5o’s statements during oral voir dire, during which Juror 5o reaffirmed that he was\n“Ta|bsolutely” able to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the\ncase based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law.

As Juror 5o later explained, that response was derived from the fact that he “began\nto float, fly through it, in order to get done” and was “super distracted.” (/d. at 4o:l8-2o). It did\nnot reflect a general disobedience of the Court’s instructions, and indeed, Juror 5o made clear that\nhe carefully folloued the Court’s instructions during voir dire—during which he paid atention to\nthe Court’s instructions, listened carefully to the Court’s questions, “answered every single one of\nthose questions accurately,” and did not “at all” fail “to pay atention to the specifics of the\nquestions”—and during trial.

Far from\nhoping to remain anonymous, Juror 5o reveled in the atention and started posting his oun\nmessages on social media, using his actual picture and his real first name, announcing to the\nworld that he was on the Maxwell jury. (See Motion at 2o, Juror 5o’s Instagram Account) (“I\ncan nou tell everyone that I was a juror on the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.”). Juror 5o was not\nlooking to avoid notice. He was looking to soak up his l5 minutes of fame. This, again, is\nstrong evidence of Juror 5o’s bias.\n\nWhether Juror 5o’s false responses were for the purpose of securing a spot on the jury or\nbecause he was deluding himself about his ability to be impartial, Juror 5o’s multiple false\nstatements on the questionnaire and to the Court add to the bases for finding that he should have\nbeen struck for cause. See Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l65 (“Even when prospective jurors are\ndishonest for reasons other than a desire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir\ndire questions indicate that a juror is unwilling or unable to apply the law as instructed by the\ncourt to the evidence presented by the parties and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of\nimpartiality[.]” (internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nFinally, Juror 5o admited that he was perfectly willing to disregard the Court\ninstructions. In light of his statements that he “flew through” the questionnaire, the Court asked\nJuror 5o whether he was concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions. (Tr. l8). Juror 5o\nresponded, “Absolutely not.” (/d.). When the Court asked him again, he again responded “No, I\nreally ... this is a terrible excuse, but I didn’t really think I would be chosen.” (/d.).

Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of selection, the Court questioned\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8. Ifa prospective juror\nwas not struck for cause, the Court instructed the nou-qualified juror to return on the morning of\nNovember 29, 2o2l, for the parties’ exercise of peremptory strikes.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s jury selection process\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire on the morning of November 4, 2o2 l—the first\nquestionnaire session. Mar. 8, 2o22 Hearing Tr. at 7. In his questionnaire, Juror 5o checked\n“No” for Question 25. Hearing Exhibit l at l3, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “Questionnaire”). He\nleft Questions 25a and 25b blank. For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside). In closing,\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 _ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt. No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 24 of 4o\nl. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. /d. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was responsive and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” /d. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at 27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll—l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” /d. at 4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l. The Court confirmed that Juror 5o “carefully” folloued the Court’s instructions during voir\ndire and trial. Id.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 22 of 45\nprejudicial variance. For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “‘a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6, 4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear ‘merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance is not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary circumstances, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.”\nUnited States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D ’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n* The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 25 of 45\nl. The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s\nsummation captured the core of criminality.\n\nFirst, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence\ncaptured the core of criminality. As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with\nfour counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual\nknoun to be under the age of seventeen. Jury Charge at 24. The jury charge made clear that this\nprovision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four. See id. at\n23-24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had\nknouingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of\nNew York Penal Law Section l3o.55, as alleged in the Indictment). The Court also accepted the\nDefendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York\nlaw. See, e.g., Request to Charge at l9, 23, 26, 3o, 3l, Dkt. No. 4lo-l; Jury Charge at 2o, 24,\n26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an\nunspecified “criminal offense”).\n\nThe jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s\nassessment of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, Counts One and Three. The charge explained\nthat the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count\nTwo. See Jury Charge at 44-45. In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the\nenticement of minors to travel and the transport of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage\nin sexual activity illegal under New York law. See id. As for the overt acts, the Court, at the\nparties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment. Trial Tr. at 278l-82.\nRather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts. Jury Charge at 49-5o. For Counts One and\nThree, this included the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>: “the Indictment alleges as follous: .. .

These instructions\npertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55. The first limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> pertained to Kate. This <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> informed\nthe jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of\nKate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.\nat ll67-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\ncommercial flights. /d. at 3l6. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these\ntravel arrangements. /d. at 3l6-l7. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York\nand photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 32o.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with\nthe Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. /d. at 32l. In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt. D Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9; see also\nUnited States v. Jones, 847 F. App’x 28, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order) (no constructive\namendment in sex trafficking case where indictment did not allege “advertising” but the\nevidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” (cleaned up)).\n\nThird, the Government’s summation also reflected the core of criminality of transporting\nJane and other underage girls to New York with the intention that sexual activity would occur in\nNew York. In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895. Thus,\nthe Court’s instructions to the jury, the evidence presented at trial, and the Government’s\nargument in summation did not describe “behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment,” Bastian, 77o F.3d at 223 (quoting Danielson, l99 F.3d at 67o), but instead\nconsistently captured the core of criminality with which the Defendant was charged.\n\n2. The jury note and the Court’s response did not result in a\nconstructive amendment.\n\nThe Defendant contends that regardless of whether the Court’s prior instructions or\nGovernment’s arguments at trial were proper, a jury note revealed that the jury convicted the\nDefendant for intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, not New York. See\nMaxwell Reply at 2. She argues that the Court then erred by refusing a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\nThe ambiguous note and the Court’s rejection of the Defendant’s proposed responses to it did not\n5 In its summation regarding Count Two, which introduced the New York predicate offense to the jury, the\nGovernment also repeatedly emphasized that the Defendant and Epstein enticed Jane to travel to New York to be\nabused.

No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.”” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot.

The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note\nfollouing the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nBy contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury. Her\nproposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the follouing morming were\nerroneous. At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant\nfirst proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a\nreturn flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”\nTrial Tr. at 3l28-3o. But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question. /d. at\n3l38. Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the principle that assistance with a return\nflight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. See id. at\n3l36. Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the\ncharge, that it direct the jury to lines l4 to l7 of <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2l, which instructed on\n“significant or motivating purpose.” /d. at 3l3l. But it was unclear that those particular lines\naddressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2l encompassed those lines.\n\nThe follouing day, although the jury had not sought further clarification, the Defendant\ntook another pass at proposing an additional response to the note. She requested a three-\nparagraph supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that referenced elements of Counts Two and Four. See Dkt.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 32 of 45\n\nNo. 566.’ The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special\nprominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v. Jones, 685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. l982), and that\ncomplete accuracy is of “crucial importance,” United States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d l68, l72 (2d\nCir. 2ol4) (quoting United States v. Lefkouitz, 284 F.2d 3lo, 3l4 (2d Cir. l96o)). Portions of\nthe requested <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> were unresponsive, portions were redundant, and portions were legally\ninaccurate. The first paragraph, which pertained to Count Two, was unresponsive to the jury’s\nnote that asked only about Count Four. The second paragraph was unnecessary because it was\nredundant. The Defendant nou raises for the first time, in a footnote, that the Court should have\nsua sponte provided the jury this paragraph alone. Maxwell Reply at 9 n.4. But the charge as a\nwhole already made clear that a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55 was the key\ninquiry. See Jury Charge at 2o, 23, 26, (specifying “a criminal offense under New York\nlaw’), 24 (Count Two instructions on New York Penal Law Section l3o.55), 28 (Count Four\nreferring back to these instructions), 49-5o (specifying the overt act of Jane traveling “from\nFlorida to New York for purposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in\nviolation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”).

No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 34 of 45\nran the risk of moving the jury away from consideration of the core of criminality alleged in the\nIndictment.®\n\nThe appropriate approach was to instruct the jury on the one and only predicate state\noffense for the Mann Act counts charged in the Indictment: New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony. Trial Tr. at\n2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774-75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on\nthe predicate state offense of New York law. The jury is presumed to have folloued these\ninstructions. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nAt botom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that\nthe jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in\nNew York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in\nNew Mexico. It is hardly plausible, let alone substantially likely, that this was the jury’s\n8 The Defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on other jurisdictions’ ages of consent first stated that “[t]o prove Counts\nOne and Three, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent\nthat the minors would engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.”\nRequest to Charge at 5l.

The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 37 of 45\nrequest a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that\nshe was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in the jury charge and a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)).

See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l8 of 29\nnot. The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\ninterpretation and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders.

The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.).

In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25).

(PSR § 36). When Jane was still only l4 years old, the defendant and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where the defendant and Epstein fondled each other,\ncasually giggling about it, while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (PSR § 34). While this\nwas happening, “there were hands everywhere,” Epstein began to masturbate, and the defendant\nrubbed, kissed, and fondled Epstein. (/d.). After this initial sexual interaction, the defendant and\nEpstein continued to sexually abuse Jane. (PSR § 35). The defendant and Epstein taught Jane\nhou Epstein liked to be massaged and gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis. (/d.).\nJane was l4 years old, and the defendant tried to make Jane feel like this was “very normal” and\n“not a big deal.” (/d.). Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein between the ages of l4\nand l6 years old, and the defendant was frequently in the room when the abuse happened. (PSR\n36). Over time, the abuse escalated, and Epstein used vibrators on Jane, masturbated, put his\nfingers in Jane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face. U/d.). The defendant sometimes\ntouched Jane during these incidents; in particular, Jane recalled that the defendant touched her\nbreasts. (/d.). The sexual abuse was not limited to Palm Beach, Florida, as Jane traveled with the\ndefendant and Epstein to Epstein’s tounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New Mexico.\n(PSR § 37). Jane was sexually abused during those trips. (/d.).\n\n2.

Instead, she argues, as a policy mater, that the 2oo4 Manual should not be applied\nbecause the defendant had “moved on,” an expression that has no legal meaning.\n\nMore importantly, documentary evidence establishes that the defendant remained a close\nassociate of Jeffrey Epstein for multiple years after 2oo2.

Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants.

(Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen.

STERNHEIAA\n\nThe CVRA Applies Only to Federal Crimes\n\nBased on the text, origin and limited legislative history, the CVRA applies to victims of\nfederal crimes only. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e). The federal crimes of conviction require the\ninvolvement of minors. The Individuals claiming sexual abuse who were not minors may\nqualify generically as victims of sexual abuse but not as statutory victims of the federal offenses\nof conviction.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" of the Counts of Conviction\n\nNeither the Superseding Indictment nor the Court’s jury instructions support a position\nthat anyone who was not a minor is a \"victim\" of the counts of conviction. The involvement of a\nminor is an essential element of the federal offense conduct. Maria Farmer claims she was\nabused during the time period of the indictment; houever, she was not a minor. Sarah Ransome\nwas not a minor when she claims she interacted with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell from\napproximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in this case ended.\nTeresa Helm also was not a minor and it is unknoun when she claims to have had contact with\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell. It is unknoun whether Juliete Bryant was a minor or when she claims\nto have had contact with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. None of these Individuals testified at trial\nand their credibility remains unexamined. Regarding the charges in this case, they do not qualify\nas victims under the CVRA.\nThe Individuals Are Not \"Victims\" Within the Meaning of the CVRA\n\nFor the Individuals to invoke the rights enumerated under the CVRA, they must first be\ndetermined to be \"victims\" within the meaning of the statute. The CVRA defines a “crime\nvictim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal\noffense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page/7of2l\n\nSo too, one of the victim witnesses present at trial was not a minor under the law of the place\nwhere she was abused. Nonetheless, the Court alloued her to testify with a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\nMaxwell’s offense conduct was not limited to minor victims.\n\nSarah and Elizabeth have the right to deliver an in—court statement at Maxwell’s sentencing.\nThe CVRA guarantees all crime victims the right to be “reasonably heard at any public proceeding in\nthe district court involving...sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right of any victim to\ngive what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally United States v,\nDegenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that the CVRA’s right to\nbe reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in—court statement. As one court\nexplained: “At a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to the judge. Read\nagainst this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally with the\ndefendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless stranger.” /d. at\nl348, quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 825 (l99l). The Ninth Circuit has reached an\nidentical conclusion. See Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal. 435 F.3d loll, lol7-l8 (9th Cir.\n2oo6). These holdings are consistent with the intentions of the CVRA’s drafters. As Senator Kyl\nexplained, “the very purpose of this section is to allou the victim to appear personally and directly\naddress the court.” l5o CONG. REC. Slo, 9ll (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2oo4) (statement of Sen. Kyl),\nquoted in Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l346.\n\nFurther, victim impact evidence is probative of the offense conduct because an “assessment of\nthe harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate\npunishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo698\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675-3 Filed o6/25/22 Pageilof5\nVICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH STEIN TO BE READ AT THE\nSENTENCING OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL\n\nI came to New York in l99l at the age of l8 to atend FIT and immediately began to excel\nacademically. While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal.

Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3. Nou, defendant Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal\ninvolvement in this far-research conspiracy. Kate clearly has a right to be heard as part of that\nprocess.\n\nAs this Court is aware, Kate was recognized in this case as a crime victim of a federally\ncharged criminal conspiracy against Ghislaine Maxwell for acts that Maxwell commited against\nKate when she was seventeen years old. While there was a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel.

As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page6of23\nthis evidence as to the sex trafficking counts, the witness is precluded from testifying that [il\n\nThe Court thus draws the line described above for limiting Witness-3’s testimony.\nPermiting the entirety of the proffered testimony carries a risk that the jury may convict Ms.\nMaxwell due to conduct that cannot form the basis of a conviction for the charged crimes. But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion.

The Court concludes that the\nexpected topics of Gershman’s testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nbeing neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims—all fall within the rubric of atacking\nthe thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt of the\ncrimes charged. In short, this testimony would run afoul of the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the jury will\nreceive that “the government is not on trial.” /d. at 23 (quoting United States v. Knox, 687 F.\nApp’x 5l, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7)).\n\nThe Court notes that a court in this district recently excluded Gershman’s testimony in a\ncivil case in which he would have similarly criticized the SEC’s investigation, including the use\nof cooperating witnesses. SEC v. Collector’s Coffee Inc., No. l9-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2o2l\nWL 34l8829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2o2l). That case differs from this one in several respects, but\nthat court’s basic reasoning informs and supports the Court’s decision here.\n\nThe Defense argues that the Court “expressly denied” prohibiting the Defense from\ncalling an expert witness like Gershman. Def. Br. at l7. Tellingly, the Defense quotes no\nlanguage from the Court for this proposition and instead cites only those pages of the Court’s\noral ruling in which the Court explained that it “will permit relevant cross-examination of the\ngovernment’s witnesses.” Nov. l Tr. at 27. This language in no fashion supports the Defense’s\nrequest to admit an expert to testify about government investigative techniques. The Court\nreiterates, houever, that it will permit the Defense to pursue “lines of cross-examination of\ngovernment witnesses [that] would be relevant to impeach a witness by suggesting bias or\notherwise implicating their credibility,” which could include the Defense’s theory of witnesses’\nmotives for “implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein’s death.” /d. at 28-29.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page6eof7\n\nSecond, even if Gershman’s testimony was relevant, Rule 4o3 prejudice would\nsubstantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November l conference. /d. at 2l-24.\nGershman’s testimony would be likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government’s\nchoices of investigative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court’s\nanticipated jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the\ntrial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense’s arguments that there is inadequate\nevidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def. Br. at\nl8. Indeed, the Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very litle of Gershman’s anticipated\ntestimony. Therefore, even if Rules 4ol and 4o3 were satisfied, the Court would exclude\nGershman’s testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule l6.\n\nIi. Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert\ntestimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise\nits request to admit Gershman as an expert witness.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document696- Filed o6/29/22 Page5of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\nSheet 3A — Supervised Release\nJudgment—Page a a of oO.\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSTANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION\n\nAs part of your supervised release, you must comply with the follouing standard conditions of supervision.

That sentence\nwould then conflict with the sentence in the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the jury may consider the evidence to\nthe extent it “is relevant to the issues before [the jury].”’> The Government proposes this edit to\navoid any potential confusion by the jury.\n\nThe Government respectfully objects to the second proposed limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>! and\nsubmits that such an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> should not be given. As an initial mater, the Government believes\nany such <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> will likely prove unnecessary at trial. The Government expects any testimony\nregarding the Minor Victims’ sexual activity above the age of consent will be brief, involve few\ndetails, and be offered solely to complete the timeline of those witness’s relationships with Epstein,\nor in anticipation of defense cross-examination about such conduct. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at 223:l-\n25). There is no need for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by\ndefense cross-examination. And insofar as that need arises, it will be clearer once witnesses have\ntestified about specific incidents at specific times where the age of consent is relevant.\n\nMoreover, the proposed limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> risks confusing the jury and prejudice to the\nGovernment. First, the language that the witness “was over the age of consent . . . at the relevant\n' For convenience, the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is the follouing:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that because the witness was over the age of consent in\n\n[insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time period, the\n\nsexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity”\n\nas the Government has charged in the Indictment. Houever, to the extent you\n\nconclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before you, you may consider\n\nit. Houever, you may not consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr.\n\nEpstein’s nor Ms. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes\n\ncharged in the Indictment.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of7\ntime period” suggests to the jury that the testimony will be that witness was above the local age of\nconsent at all relevant times. That will not be the testimony at trial—for instance, Minor Victim-\nl and Minor Vicitim-4 will testify that they were l4 when Epstein and the defendant first enticed\nor trafficked them into sexual activity, but, to complete the timeline of their interactions with\nEpstein and the defendant, will provide only brief testimony that they continued having sexual\ninteractions with Epstein past the relevant age of consent for the Mann Act or sex trafficking\ncounts. To be accurate, the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would need to clarify that the witness will testify that she\nreached the age of majority at some point during her testimony, not that she was over the age of\nconsent, full stop.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the defendant has indicated that she intends to dispute when certain\nevents occurred and the ages of the victims at those times. A limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> suggesting that\nthe Minor Victims were “above the age of consent” or not engaged in “illegal sexual activity”\nwould essentially instruct the jury that the Minor Victims were, in fact, above the age of consent\nat all relevant times, as the defense is expected to argue. Accordingly, at a minimum, any\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on that issue should be balanced. If the Court explains to the jury that the Minor\nVictims were above the age of consent under some state’s law at some point, such that they could\nnot have engaged in “illegal sexual activity,” the Court should also explain that they may still have\nbeen under the age of consent for purposes of the New York offense alleged in the Indictment and\nl8 U.S.C. § l59l, such that they could still be under the age of consent required to prove the Mann\nAct and sex trafficking conspiracy counts.\n\nThird, the ages of consent in jurisdictions other than New York are not relevant to the\nfactual question before the jury. To the extent a witness engaged in sexual activity that was lawful\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of7\nunder the laws of a state where that sexual activity occurred because the witness was above that\nstate’s age of consent, the defendant is not charged with any such conduct. The proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is not fully accurate when it says that sexual activity is not “illegal sexual activity’ as\nthe Government has charged in the Indictment” “because the witness was over the age of consent”\nin the relevant jurisdiction; rather, whether the sexual activity is or is not “illegal sexual activity”\nregarding the offenses in the Indictment is determined by reference only to New York state law\nand New York’s age of consent. As is clear from the Government’s proposed request to charge,\nthe Government is not proceeding on a theory that a violation of any law other the New York law\nwas an object of the Mann Act counts. See Proposed Request to Charge at 23, 3l, 5l-52. And\nwhile sexual activity over some other state’s age of consent cannot establish a substantive Mann\nAct offense because it was not “illegal sexual activity,” for the purposes of the conspiracy counts,\nthe Government need not prove that any illegal sexual activity actually occurred. All that is\nrequired is that the defendant intended illegal sexual activity—that is, a violation of the New York\nobject offense—to occur. See Proposed Request to Charge at 45. And sexual activity in New\nMexico or Florida with someone belou New York’s age of consent is direct evidence of that\noffense, whatever the local ages of consent.\n\nAn <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that sexual contact in a jurisdiction other than New York is not “illegal\nsexual activity” because it was over some other state’s age of consent would likely confuse the\njury by (l) informing the jury about a state age of consent that is not relevant to the crimes charged\nin the Indictment, and (2) suggest to the jury that sexual contact was “not illegal” because it was\nabove that state’s age of consent, even though it is direct evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\nFurther, as to the sex trafficking counts, state laws and ages of consent are entirely\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nirrelevant. If a commercial sex act occurred involving a l7-year-old in New York, that sexual\nactivity is illegal under l8 U.S.C. § l59l because it involves a minor, even though it is above New\nYork’s age of consent. Although the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> uses the phrase “illegal sexual activity,” an\nelement of the Mann Act, the jury is likely not to grasp that point in a short mid-trial <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>,\ndivorced from a discussion of the elements of the offenses. The jury would therefore also be\nconfused into thinking incorrectly that sexual activity that is “not illegal” under the local law is\nsimilarly lawful under federal law.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that—as to New Mexico in particular—age of consent is\nnot a simple and straightforward question. As the defense noted in their opposition to the\nGovernment’s motions in limine, “New Mexico does not have a specific age of consent.” (Def.\nOpp. at 46, Dkt. No. 483). The age of consent can also depend on the specific sexual act involved,\nwhich may require analysis of New Mexico state law in comparison to the facts elicited at trial.\nCompare id. at 46 & n.43 (noting that the age of consent depends on whether coercion or force are\ninvolved), with State v. Begaye, -- P. 3d --, 2o2l WL 5l73l5o, at * 2 (N.M. Ct. App. 2o2l)\n(affirming conviction of defendant who forcibly hugged a sixteen-year-old and, when releasing\nher, “brushed his hand over her chest and squeezed her breast”). It therefore cannot be said that a\nsexual act in New Mexico was “above the age of consent” without determining what sexual act\noccurred and hou New Mexico state law would treat that act.\n\nIn the Government’s view, these issues are best explained to the jury in the concluding jury\ninstructions, where the jury can be fully instructed on the relevant law and then apply that law to\nthe facts it finds have been established at trial. And no limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is needed because, as\nwill be explained to the jury in the concluding instructions, they can only convict for violations of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6eof7\nthe Mann Act with the New York state law (including the New York age of consent) as its object,\nor for violations of § l59l, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. There is accordingly no risk\nthat the jury will convict the defendant for violating an unidentified local sex crimes law for which\nthe Minor Victim was above the age of consent. Asa result, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court refrain from giving the second limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> at all during this trial.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless decides to give the second limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the Government\nproposes the follouing revision to give the jury an understanding both of what is and what is not\nillegal sexual activity:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that if and when beeause the witness was over the age of\n\nconsent in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time\n\nperiod, the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not itself “illegal\n\nsexual activity” as the Government has charged in the Indictment. [The age of\n\nconsent in that jurisdiction is [insert relevant age of consent or analysis\n\nthereof]]._ Houever, to the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to\n\nthe issues before you, including the defendant’s intent for that witness to engage\n\nin illegal sexual activity in New York as charged in the Indictment, you may\n\nconsider it. Even when the witness was over the age of consent in [insert\n\nrelevant jurisdiction, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may\nconclude that the witness was belou the age of consent in New York, which is\n\nl7 years old. [For witnesses relevant to the sex trafficking counts: Further,\n\nthe sexual conduct may be considered in determining whether the defendant\n\nintended the witness to engage in a “commercial sex act” before reaching the\n\nage of l8, and for which the age of consent in [insert relevant jurisdiction] is\n\nirrelevant.] Houever, you may not consider this testimony regarding sexual\n\nactivity that took place above the age of consent with respect to the relevant\nstatute as I have just described it as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor\n\nMs. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment.\n\nThe proposed revision provides the jury with information that matches the expected\ntestimony, provides the jury with sufficient context about the question before it to avoid confusion\nabout hou it can and cannot consider the sexual activity, avoids an inaccurate statement of state\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page/7of7\n\nlaw, avoids incorrectly suggesting that the entirety of the witness’s testimony will describe events\nthat took place after the witness reached the age of consent, and avoids prejudice to the\nGovernment from an unbalanced <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. In the Government’s view, houever, any concern\nthat jurors will mistakenly think they should convict on the basis of some violation of another\nstate’s laws is best addressed in the concluding jury instructions.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nPursuant to the Court’s Order of earlier today, we respectfully submit this leter in\nopposition to the government’s request to modify the Court’s proposed limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nconcerning the testimony of Witness-3. The government’s request is yet another example of its\nrepeated atempts to relitigate issues that have been decided against them. The Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nis appropriate and balanced and should not be changed.\n\nWe should be clear from the outset — we are in this position because the government is\ninsisting on calling a witness who has alleged conduct that is not illegal. The Court has ruled, and\nthe government has itself conceded, that Witness-3 “is not a victim of any of the crimes charged in\nthe Indictment.” ll/l9/2o2l Op. and Order at 2. The Court has correctly recognized that having\nWitness-3 describe the details of her sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein would have no probative value\nbecause it cannot establish an element of the charged offenses. See id. at 4 (“There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding the\nsexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged.’’); see also\n2o6l438.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

That is the trade-off they must live with if they persist in\ncalling this witness. Moreover, the government’s argument that the defense has somehou put at\nissue all of the details of Witness-3’s sex acts with Epstein simply by questioning the accuracy of\nthe accusers’ memories is nonsense. The dates and specifics of the alleged abuse of other\nwitnesses are entirely separate from the issue of whether the Court’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is\nmisleading as to the testimony of Witness-3. It is not.\n\nThe Court has already carefully considered the limits of Witness-3’s testimony and has\nbalanced the government’s use of this witness to establish intent, motive, etc., and the need to\nprotect Ms. Maxwell from undue prejudice and a conviction based on an improper premise.

And I'll\n\nl8 consider the alterations you're suggesting. What we can't do\nl9 is infuse the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> with the government's case and\n2o arguments. The point here is just to make clear what the\n2l jurors can't do and then, to the extent they otherwise deem the\n22 evidence relevant, they can consider it and we'll give them the\n23 charge at the end of the day. But I'll consider the\n24 suggestions.

EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. I mean, it's the\n\n2 defense's position that the Court's <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is a correct\n\n3 statement of law. It's concise, it's clear, and will clarify\n\n4 the issues for the jurors as opposed to confuse the issues. I\na think the government's <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is exactly the opposite. It\n6 is cumbersome, it is difficult to follou, and it will confuse\n\n7 rather than to clarify.\n\n8 And I will just point out, I think your Honor\n\n9 identified the correct example, which is Accuser 2, which is\n\nlo alleged events that took place in New Mexico when she was above\nll the age of consent for those acts in New Mexico.\n\nl2 And so this illustrates the problem of trying to prove\nl3 a conspiracy where the illegal sexual activity is a violation\nl4 of New York law with acts that took place in other\n\nl5 jurisdictions which were legal and have nothing to do with New\nl6 York law.\n\nl7 So as I think you've discussed before, your Honor, if\nl8 the witness is going to testify to these events that took place\nl9 in New Mexico, even though they're legal under New York law --\n2o there's no issue there -- they're going to --\n2l THE COURT: Not under New York law.\n22 MR.

Right? You haven't\n22 charged pursuant to New Mexico law. But if what the government\n23 is saying is, I shouldn't give that charge because in fact\n24 you're going to shou that it was illegal sexual activity -- I'm\n25 not going to misinform the jury that it wasn't illegal under\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Page35oof43 35\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl New Mexico law if that's something the government is going to\n2 shou.\n\n3 MR.

That's just a point in\nl6 terms of the accuracy of the proposed jury <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> -- that\nl7 is, whether the sexual conduct was legal or illegal within New\nl8 Mexico.\n\nl9 THE COURT: So what I had said was, \"I anticipate\n2o you'll hear testimony from the next witness about sexual\nal conduct that she says she had with Mr. Epstein in New Mexico.\"\n22 And then I had suggested, because it's what I understood from\n23 the parties, \"I instruct you that because the witness was over\n24 the age of consent in New Mexico at the relevant time period,\n25 the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll656\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011659.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 38of43 38\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl Honor.  -- New Mexico law, that we would have a substantive\n\n2 violation in addition for this witness.

I'll\n4 try to avoid such interruptions as much as possible, but please\n5) be patient and understand that these conferences are necessary\n6 to ensure the fairness of the trial and often make the trial go\n7 faster.\n\n8 While I decide the law that applies to this case, you,\n9 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are the triers of fact.\n\nlo You'll weigh the evidence presented and decide whether the\n\nll government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nl2 defendant is guilty of the charges in the indictment. You must\nl3 pay close atention to all of the evidence presented, and you\nl4 must base your decision only on the evidence in the case and my\nl5 instructions about the law.\n\nl6 What then is evidence?\n\nl7 Evidence consists only of the testimony of witnesses,\nl8 documents, and other things admited as evidence or\n\nl9 stipulations agreed to by the parties. Some of you have\n2o probably heard the term \"circumstantial evidence, direct\n2l evidence.\" Do not be concerned with these terms. You are to\n22 consider all of the evidence given in this trial. Certain\n23 things are not evidence and must not be considered by you. The\n24 follouing is a list of what is not evidence:\n25 First, arguments, statements, and questions by the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooll683\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9 of lo6 23\nLBTVMAXl\n\nl lawyers are not evidence, nor are statements I make or\n\n2 questions I ask of a witness.\n\n3 Second, objections to questions are not evidence. The\n4 lawyers have an obligation to make an objection when they\n\na believe evidence being offered is improper under the rules of\n\n6 evidence. You should not be influenced by the objection or by\n7 my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the\n8 question and any answer that may have been given. If it's\n\n9 overruled, treat the answer like any other. Tf you're\n\nlo instructed that some item of evidence is received for a limited\nll purpose only, you must follou that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nl2 Third, the testimony that I've excluded or told you to\nl3 disregard is not evidence and must not be considered.\n\nl4 Fourth, anything you may have seen or heard outside\n\nl5 the courtroom is not evidence and must be disregarded. You are\nl6 to decide this case solely on the evidence presented here in\n\nl7 the courtroom.\n\nl8 There is no formula to evaluate testimony or exhibits.\nl9 For nou, suffice it to say that you bring with you into this\n2o courtroom all of the experience and background of your lives.\n2l Do not leave your common sense outside the courtroom. The same\n22 types of tests that you use in your everyday dealings are the\n23 tests that you should apply in deciding hou much weight, if\n24 any, to give to the evidence in this case.\n25 The law does not require you to accept all of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll684\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of lo6 27\nLBTVMAXl\n\nl throughout this process, this rule is very, very important.\n\n2 That's because your decision in this case must be made solely\n\n3 on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at this trial.\n\n4 In other words, all that you need to knou will be presented\n\na here in open court by the parties.

I received a leter\n\n2 briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request\n\n3 for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> with respect to the next anticipated\n4 witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.\n\n5 As the government has indicated, because Kate was over\n6 the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time\n\n7 that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's\n8 not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this\n9 basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as\n\nlo irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I\n\nll concluded based on the government's proffer that she has\n\nl2 relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act\n\nl3 counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 4o4(b).\nl4 To avoid jury confusion and prejudice, houever, I\n\nl5 concluded that her testimony should be limited in the\n\nl6 description of details of the sexual conduct that does not form\nl7 a basis of the charged counts and that a Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nl8 was required.\n\nl9 Over the weekend, the government asked for me to\n2o include in the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> a statement that I\n2l instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual\n22 conduct that the witness will testify occurred with\n23 Mr. Epstein.

And about hou soon after you started your job did you\n\nl8 transition to becoming Ghislaine's executive assistant?\n\nl9 A. I would say it was within a month. It was kind of quick.\n2o Q. What were your responsibilities as Ghislaine's executive\n2l assistant?\n22 A. Making arrangements.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the\n\n3 defense confuses conspiracy violations and substantive\n\n4 violations. There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 conspiracy count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the island.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the island. That's\n24 not travel to New York. And her mother said she couldn't be\n25 able to go. So I don't think that is evidence -- if the object\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool43l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagellof95 2749\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl of the conspiracy is to violate New York law, then an\n\n2 invitation to an island that's not New York doesn't count.\n\n3 And also, an invitation to travel to New Mexico to do\n4 whatever it is they were planning on doing in New Mexico is\n\n5) also not a goal of violating New York law. I'm sorry, from\n\n6 Arizona. So there's no connection to New York law with respect\n7 to Annie's testimony either.\n\n8 And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those\n9 two witnesses' testimony, Kate and Annie, or even Carolyn, the\nlo object of this conspiracy, for this to be a crime, it can only\nll be hung on the testimony, at least in the evidence in the\n\nl2 record, the testimony of Jane. And --\n\nl3 THE COURT: You're doing precisely what Mr. Rohrbach\nl4 said, which is you're switching back and forth between the\n\nl5 conspiracy and the substantive count.

It's the practice, as Sand endorses, to rephrase\nlo \"dominant\" as \"significant or motivating purpose\" to avoid\n\nll confusion, because it doesn't have to be the sole dominant\n\nl2 purpose, it just has to be a dominant purpose, and so from\n\nl3 Sand, that creates ambiguity that it has to be a sufficient --\nl4 such a big purpose that it's the dominant purpose, which is not\nl5 what is required by the statute.

There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge. So I actually think\n25 there is more support in the case law for the \"one dominant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 32 of 95 277o\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl purpose\" language than language that happened to have been\n\n2 invented by Sand. As smart as Judge Sand was, that did not\n\n3 actually come from any circuit case law. So we propose going\n\n4 with what the courts have actually said on this issue rather\n\n5 than a proposal in Sand.\n\n6 THE COURT: I'm just going to read for a moment.\n\n7 I think I want to start by asking what's wrong with\n\n8 the current <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the one that you proposed that I\n\n9 adopted? That's the one that I've seen in --\n\nlo MR. EVERDELL: Well —-\n\nll THE COURT: -- in charges.\n\nl2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, there's nothing wrong with\nl3 it per se. It is a charge that has been used in other cases,\nl4 and we proposed it, so we obviously think it's acceptable. But\nl5 I think the new proposed charge is a charge that is more\n\nl6 accurate and also tracks the case law development on this point\nl7 because the dominant purpose is actually something that was in\nl8 a Second Circuit opinion and it's, you knou -- Judge Rakoff has\nl9 tried to craft an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in Miller to deal with the issue\n2o of one dominant purpose versus the dominant purpose, but the\nal way that I think the case law has developed in the Second\n22 Circuit, it started with \"dominant purpose\" was the language\n23 used and then we had to deal with this issue of ambiguity\n24 there, and this is hou Judge Rakoff came out, but was still\n25 keeping the \"dominant purpose\" language but clarifying it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 33 of 95 277l\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl only one of the dominant purposes.\n\n2 THE COURT: Let me just note my remarkably crack law\n\n3 clerks have found the follouing case: United States v. An Soon\n4 Kim,\n\n5 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.\n\n6 THE COURT: You're aware of it.\n\n7 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. But that case —-—\n\n8 THE COURT: Just let me give the cite. 47l F. App'x\n\n9 82 (2d Cir. 2ol2). Summary order, obviously, but it says a\n\nlo couple of things. One -- ooh, I lost what my crack law clerk\nll sent there. It endorses the Sand language over \"dominant.\"\n\nl2 \"These instructions are legally sound. Neither 'dominant' nor\nl3 \"oredominant' appear in the statutory language. Although we\n\nl4 have previously approved a jury charge that included the phrase\nl5 \"one of the dominant purposes,\" (see, e.g., Miller) we've never\nl6 required such language to appear in a jury charge on 242l.\n\nl7 Indeed, Judge Sand recommends excluding the word 'dominant'\n\nl8 from the charge so as to avoid confusion.\" And then at the end\nl9 of the opinion, \"The charge given by the district court, which\n2o closely tracks the charge outlined by Judge Sand, accurately\n2l and thoroughly conveyed the second element of the crime.\n22 Accordingly, we find no error, much less plain error, in the\n23 jury charge.\"\n24 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. So the way I read that case, your\n25 Honor, is that there are two variants on hou this charge has\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 35 of 95 2773\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl THE COURT: All right. Page 24, line l9, I'll adopt\n\n2 that change. So instead of \"the defendant,\" \"Ms. Maxwell.\"\n\n3 Just one moment.\n\n4 Okay.\n\n5 MR. EVERDELL: Okay. So the additional request is --\n6 this is where the issue of the fact that Kate was above the age\n7 of consent and about the fact that -- well, Annie's testimony\n\n8 was not a violation of New York law. That's what the Court\n\n9 gave the Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to the jury on. We think that it\nlo is appropriate to incorporate those Limiting instructions into\nll the jury charge and that this is the place where it should be\nl2 given. Because it's one thing to give the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nl3 at the time of the testimony -- that is what we asked for and\nl4 we appreciate the Court doing that -- but I think that they\n\nl5 need to be instructed again before they go into deliberations,\nl6 nou having heard l2 plus days of testimony, that what those\n\nl7 considerations -- that testimony they are alloued to consider\nl8 for what purpose, because if they're given an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on\n\nl9 New York law, I think it's time to reiterate in the charge to\n2o them that Kate was over the age of consent and was not\n2l involved -- it cannot be considered illegal sexual activity,\n22 because this is where the illegal sexual activity is defined.\n23 And same with Annie. I have a proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to add\n24 here, but it tracks the language of the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n25 the Court gave, so I don't think it's adding any language.

ROHRBACH: I think that among other things, your\nl7 Honor, I think that would be -- the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> as you've\n\nl8 crafted it is a correct statement of New York law and the\n\nl9 relevant issues. Adding these instructions would be quite\n2o confusing to the jury. The jury has already heard them. This\nal is the place where there's no reason to give the Kate\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> because these jury instructions state specifically\n23 that the jury may not convict based solely on overt acts that\n24 relate to Kate, and so there is no risk, when these full set of\n25 instructions is read to the jury, that they will think that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool434o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 37 of 95 2775\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl they can convict based on the illegal sexual activity as it\n\n2 relates to Kate and as it relates to Annie. Annie only relates\n3 to the conspiracy counts, at least as to these Mann Act\n\n4 charges, and the jury is going to be instructed here that the\n\n5 relevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the\n6 New York offense. So again, there's no risk that the jury will\n7 think that the sexual contact that happened in New Mexico is\n\n8 something that on its oun is sufficient to shou the illegal\n\n9 sexual activity required by the statute. So, here, in the full\nlo set of instructions, there's no need for an additional\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, especially on top of the fact that the Court has\nl2 already given these limiting instructions to the jury.\n\nl3 THE COURT: All right. I agree with that.\n\nl4 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, there's one other\n\nl5 issue, which is the part that's not in the typewriten\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> I handed you, which is the fact that Jane testified\nl7 about traveling to New Mexico at various times in her\n\nl8 testimony. And there was I think one trip she may have said\n\nl9 she was under the age of l6, which -- l5 or l6 I think is what\n2o she said as to that trip, which we believe is the actual legal\n2l age of consent in New Mexico; but she also testified about\n22 other travel to New Mexico, where events took place, where\n23 sexual contact took place, and so I think with respect to that,\n24 we are going to need some kind of <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to the jury that\n25 if she's above the age of consent in New Mexico, that can't be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 38 of 95 2776\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl considered illegal sexual activity for the purposes of their\n\n2 deliberations. It's not as charged in the indictment. We're\n\n3 talking about New York law, so I don't knou if that was made\n\n4 clear to the jury.\n\n5 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, these instructions do not\n\n6 put before the jury any violation of any New Mexico offense\n\n7 whatsoever above or belou the age of consent, so I think\n\n8 there's no risk that the jury is going to convict the defendant\n9 based on their concerns about a violation of a New York\n\nlo offense.\n\nll MR. EVERDELL: That's not really the issue about what\nl2 instructions to put before the jury. The testimony put before\nl3 the jury, sexual contact between Jane and Epstein in New Mexico\nl4 after what we believe is the age of consent in New Mexico, and\nl5 so if --\n\nl6 THE COURT: That's why, I think, it's the same reason\nl7 I gave limiting instructions as asked with respect to the\n\nl8 testimony of Kate and Annie. I think what I'm hearing you say\nl9 is, you meant to ask for a Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> at that time?\n2o MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, we knew from the\n2l proffered 35oos for the other witnesses what they were planning\n22 on testifying to, so we were able to request those at the time\n23 before the witnesses testified and brief those in limine. I\n24 didn't think we -- what we knew about Jane ahead of time was\n25 that she alleged that she traveled to New Mexico but that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 39 of 95 2777\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl nothing happened on the New Mexico trips, and then I think it\n\n2 came out in the testimony -- unless the government wants to\n\ni) correct me if we're wrong about that, but I think that our\n\n4 status of our knouledge was that we weren't expecting to hear\n\n5 about testimony about sexual contact in New Mexico. But they\n\n6 can correct me if I'm wrong about that.\n\n7 MR. ROHRBACH: I believe that Jane only testified as\n\n8 to one sexual incident of sexual abuse in New Mexico and that\n\n9 that was reflected in the 35oo material. I think Ms. Pomerantz\nlo is looking for it, but it should not have been a surprise to\n\nll the defense.\n\nl2 THE COURT: Yeah. I mean, the problem —- the\n\nl3 instructions are accurate. It's clear it's a violation of New\nl4 York law. This was the government's argument for not giving\n\nl5 the limiting instructions that I gave with respect to Annie and\nl6 Kate, but I did give those instructions. It sounds like maybe\nl7 there was an instance in which the defense might have requested\nl8 one follouing a particular piece of testimony. To add that\n\nl9 nou, having not -- well, let me put it this way. Having not\n2o asked for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> then I don't think provides a\n2l basis for inclusion of limiting instructions, repetition of\n22 limiting instructions in the charge, and even without it, which\n23 was the government's original argument, it's clear that the\n24 violation of law is as charged in New York. So I'm not\n25 persuaded to include it. I'm not persuaded to include it.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4l of 95 2779\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl which is on the next page, page 26.

EVERDELL: Well, let me see about that.\n\n4 Are we talking just about the overt acts with respect\n5 to Jane or are we talking about with Annie as well? Because\n\n6 the overt act with respect to Annie is, she's saying she's\n\n7 under the age of l8, but the age of consent there is l6, so --\n8 and Kate -- there are a few issues here, so I'll just lay them\n) out.\n\nlo The <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> with Annie is, you knou, there's the\nll age of consent issue with Annie. But skipping to Kate, which\nl2 is No. 4, on line l8, I don't think that should be in there at\nl3 all because that invites them to base an overt act and convict\nl4 the defendant based on Kate's testimony, which the Court has\n\nl5 already instructed that the jury can't. So, I mean, if they\n\nl6 found that this element was satisfied solely with Kate's\n\nl7 testimony, that would be an improper conviction. So that\n\nl8 shouldn't be included.\n\nl9 MR. ROHRBACH: Insofar as we'tre no longer follouing\n2o the exact text of the indictment, the government would be fine\nal with deleting the overt act relevant to Kate for the reason\n22 Mr. Everdell stated.\n23 THE COURT: Okay. All right.\n24 MR. EVERDELL: All right. So then I think we could\n25 probably say with respect to l and 2, which we're talking about\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 53 of 95 279l\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl Jane, Jane was -- we would say the indictment alleges that Jane\n2 was under the age of l7, in both l and 2.\n\n3 THE COURT: All right.

So my first\n24 objection is that I don't think you can actually consider\n25 Annie's testimony as the overt act if what's described there is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page55of95 2793\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl THE COURT: And again, noting that that's why I gave\n\n2 the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for Annie's testimony, that's why the\n3 limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> did differ from the Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n\n4 for Kate, because that is the Court's legal conclusion.\n\n5 MR.

Mr. Everdell.\n\n3 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor. The next page\n\n4 we have is page 54, <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> 39, the conscious avoidance\n\niy <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. Your Honor, on that, the defense objects to this\n6 being included, this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> being included in the charge.\n7 I think, as the Court is aware, to include an\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on conscious avoidance, you have to establish two\n\n) prongs. First is that the defendant has to assert some lack of\nlo specific aspect of knouledge required for conviction. I don't\nll think we're disputing that. But the second prong is that there\nl2 must be an appropriate factual predicate for the charge. And\nl3 here, your Honor, the government's theory of the case and the\nl4 proof that's been elicited through the testimony is that she\nl5 was an active participant in all aspects of the charges. There\nl6 has been testimony by all of the witnesses that she was not\nl7 only participating and facilitating the sexual encounters but\nl8 that she participated. So we have testimony from Jane that she\nl9 was involved, that Ms. Maxwell was involved in the group\n2o sexualized massages. We had testimony from Annie that the\nal topless massage was done by Ms. Maxwell; she rubbed the top\n22 part of her chest during the topless massage. We had testimony\n23 from Carolyn that Ms. Maxwell groped her breasts and commented\n24 upon her hips. These are all active-participant measures.\n25 This is someone that's not consciously avoiding.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 95 2799\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl The theory they are proceeding on is that she is an\n\n2 active participant. They can't have it both ways. The proof\n\n3 at trial that they have elicited is that she was actively\n\n4 involved. This seems to be here as some sort of backup option.\n5 And that's not permissible, your Honor.\n\n6 And I would add that, in a case like this in\n\n7 particular, there is a real concern that the jurors are going\n\n8 to look at this evidence and, given the subject mater of the\n\n9 case, they're going to think, well, she must have knoun and\n\nlo that's enough for me because this is conduct that really I\n\nll can't countenance because it involves children. And then the\nl2 conscious avoidance <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> will give them license to\n\nl3 convict the defendant on an improper basis simply because of\n\nl4 the nature of the subject mater.\n\nl5 So that's an overlay, your Honor. But at the basis,\nl6 it's that the proof and the theory of the charging in this case\nl7 and the proof that's gone with it is that she's an active\n\nl8 participant o, so we do not think that there is an appropriate\nl9 factual predicate for this charge.\n2o MR. ROHRBACH: A few responses to that, your Honor.\n2l First of all, the witnesses testified that she was an active\n22 participant. The jury may reject their testimony that she\n23 actively participated and can still convict based on her\n24 facilitation of the various offenses, including through a\n25 conscious avoidance theory.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 68 of 95 28o6\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl being -- that's a factual dispute as well: when did we -- you\n\n2 knou, when did Ms. Roberts appear?

A\nl5 conscious avoidance theory is an appropriate way to do so.\nl6 THE COURT: Yes. It's a fair point. And I'm going to\nl7 look carefully at relevant portions of the transcript, but I do\nl8 think it is sufficiently in issue that it's appropriate to give\nl9 the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.

I assume\n\n2 the defendant is going to say that she didn't knou the purposes\n3 of the trips. To the extent the purpose was sexual abuse, the\n4 government would argue that at a minimum this she did knou, if\n5 she didn't she consciously avoided knouing, why Jeffrey Epstein\n6 was traveling repeatedly with these minors.\n\n7 THE COURT: The other point is, from the openings, I\n\n8 don't knou if it will be a theme of the closing, but the\n\n) distancing of Ms. Maxwell from Mr. Epstein and what he did was\nlo clearly a theme of the opening, and so that implicates\n\nll knouledge throughout the counts.\n\nl2 So my strong inclination is that it's appropriate\n\nl3 here. That's my conclusion. That's my conclusion. I'm going\nl4 to look back through relevant portions of testimony on the age\nl5 issue, but I think even the age issue -- well, not the age\n\nl6 issue.

I'll take a\n2o look. We'll look at it. And when I send you the redline\n2l you'll either see it or not.\n22 MR.

The government does have the option of\n\nl8 giving those witnesses immunity to testify. And so they\n\nl9 actually control, more than we do, whether or not a witness can\n2o appear —-\n2l THE COURT: To be clear, that didn't happen. They\n22 didn't call that witness.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: We had a witness who invoked their\n24 Fifth Amendment rights or had writen the Court that they\n25 planned to invoke, and that we called and was under subpoena\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 77 of 95 28l5\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl So there is more than just the one witness who indicated that\n\n2 she was going to invoke had the defense called her. There were\n3 other co-conspirators who the government chose not to call, not\n4 to immunize, and we couldn't possibly call in our defense\n\n5 without -- because we can't give any immunity ourselves.\n\n6 MR.

I don't think it's necessary for Counts One\n2o and Three. I think the answer is clearly yes, made all the\n2l more so by the fact that Annie's testimony or a part of it is\n22 referenced as an overt act in the indictment in the\n23 instructions. I think the simplest answer and the correct\n24 answer is yes.\n25 MR.

So if the\n2l simple answer is yes, then the concern is that they would use\n22 it and apply the testimony more broadly.

And in their minds, there still is a\n\nll question, it would seem, that the flight -- whatever the\n\nl2 purpose of the flight to New Mexico was, whether it was for\n\nl3 illicit sexual activity or not, that is different from the\n\nl4 purpose of the flight back from New Mexico. And they are\n\nl5 asking can she be found guilty solely on if there's some aiding\nl6 and abeting, some helping of that flight from New Mexico,\n\nl7 which presumably the flight home they're saying.\n\nl8 THE COURT: So the flight from New Mexico to where?\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, there is no record of a flight\n2o from New Mexico. But what they are saying, I think, in this\n2l note is they are separating out in their minds the flight to\n22 New Mexico versus whatever flight she may have taken from New\n23 Mexico. And I would say based on the instructions in the\n24 Court's instructions which the government pointed to, there has\n25 to be -- the significant or motivating purpose of the travel\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l4 of 29 3l3l\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl We can't tell which flight we're talking about, which\n2 leg of a potentially multi-leg trip we're talking about.

And I think simply saying it's confusing --\n\n6 THE COURT: Well, I find it confusing. For example, I\n7 don't knou if this is a question about aiding and abeting. I\n8 don't knou.\n\n9 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think this is prety —- I\nlo think this is a question about whether you can hold her\n\nll accountable for a return flight, if you believe that she had\n\nl2 something to do with arranging that return flight from New\n\nl3 Mexico; whereas the first flight to New Mexico may have been --\nl4 at least there's some testimony to consider about whether that\nl5 was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. It was not\n\nl6 true of the return flight, the flight back, wherever she was\n\nl7 going, home, somewhere else, somewhere away from Mr. Epstein.\nl8 I think they are asking, Can we consider if Ms.\n\nl9 Maxwell had anything to do with that flight, arranging of that\n2o flight, whether she can be convicted, because it's on the\n2l return trip from an area where Jane claims she was involved in\n22 sexual abuse.\n23 THE COURT: But it says where/if the intent was to\n24 engage -- for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n25 MR. EVERDELL: Right. They are saying with a flight\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool47ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 29 3l33\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl to New Mexico, where/if there was an intent for Jane to engage\n2 in sexual activity. So there is still an open question in\n\ni) their minds about whether the flight to New Mexico, that\n\n4 travel, was for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual\n\n5 activity.\n\n6 But they are nou considering whether the flight out of\n7 New Mexico, if Ms. Maxwell had any -- did anything to do with\n\n8 that flight, with arranging that flight, could we convict her\n\n9 on that count alone. Because there is no, I think, evidence\n\nlo that she arranged the flight going to New Mexico; instead, they\nll are considering nou whether there's any evidence that she may\nl2 have arranged the flight out of New Mexico. And is that enough\nl3 to provide a conviction on Count Two? And I think the answer\nl4 to that is prety clearly no -- I'm sorry, Count Four I should\nl5 have said, not Count Two. Because there's no evidence of that.\nl6 And there is also -- there is no -- in the\n\nl7 instructions themselves, that would not be a significant or\n\nl8 motivating purpose for that travel across state lines. That\n\nl9 would simply be for her to return home. That's not travel for\n2o the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity.\n2l MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think this colloguy\n22 illustrates hou confusing the note is. We are nou guessing at\n23 what hypothetical facts the jury is talking about; and then\n24 guessing hypothetically what their legal question is on top of\n25 that. And I think we're compounding guesswork, what this\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool47o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel7 of 29 3l34\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl question is about. And so the question is about the element;\n\n2 the charge is about that particular element. I think more\n\n3 guesswork here makes this more confusing and not less\n\n4 confusing. I think, as the Court pointed out, some aspects of\na this note are about aiding and abeting. And so even referring\n6 the jury just to <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> number 2l leaves out that aspect\n\n7 of the jury's deliberations and their determination on this\n\n8 particular issue. And so we think the safest course is to\n\n9 provide the jury with applicable law in this area, and they can\nlo find the facts as they see fit and as they apply to these\n\nll particular instructions.\n\nl2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think this is a\n\nl3 question about aid and abeting, broadly speaking. I think\n\nl4 they are talking about the flights to and from New Mexico. I\nl5 think that much is prety clear from the note. And whether or\nl6 not Ms. Maxwell had anything to do with arranging that\n\nl7 travel —-\n\nl8 THE COURT: But your legal contention is she can't be\nl9 found guilty of this count unless the jury concludes that she\n2o aided in the transportation to New Mexico.\n2l That's not legally accurate, is it?\n22 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> itself says\n23 it has to be a significant or motivating purpose for the travel\n24 across state lines.\n25 THE COURT: Right.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool47o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o of 29 3l37\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl Mexico rather than the place where they did put the comma, then\n\n2 that would have told us, can't she be responsible for aiding in\n\n3 the transportation of the return flight, comma, but not the\n\n4 flight to New Mexico, comma. That would then put the where/if\n\n5 the intent was —-\n\n6 THE COURT: That would be an entirely different\n\n7 meaning to the question.\n\n8 MS. MENNINGER: I think so.\n\n9 THE COURT: No, I agree.

MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nl4 And I think at the point at which we're parsing jury\nl5 notes like statutes this finely, I think it illustrates the\nl6 point that this note is confusing; that we're not sure what the\nl7 jury is asking about either factually or legally.\nl8 The question is about the second element; and so we\nl9 think the proper course is to refer the jury to those\n2o particular instructions. And the jury is free to senda\n2l clarifying note, if they wish to do so. But I think when we\n22 are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it's\n23 unclear which clauses are modifying which clauses, or which\n24 flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too\n25 confusing to give simple answers here.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool47o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l of 29 3l38\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl THE COURT: I can't answer this ambiguous guestion no.\n2 I don't knou that the answer is no, even with the ambiguity;\n\n3 because I don't knou if what they have in mind is an aiding and\n4 abeting question, which we haven't discussed yet.\n\n5) MS.

I won't assume that's the\n\n7 question for purposes of the answer, but I also don't assume\n\n8 the meaning that you've put on it for purposes of the answer.\n\n9 So the only solution here is to say, I direct you to consider\nlo the full <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on Element 2 of Count Four on page 28.\n\nll MS.

The photograph on the phone keeps\n24 disappearing.\n25 We're talking about they are referring to Count Four,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool47o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 29 3l39\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl which is the substantive transportation count, which, as we\n\n2 knou, has to deal with the violation of New York law. And they\n3 are talking about flights to New Mexico; and can she be found\n\n4 guilty on the second element of Count Four regarding these\n\n5 flights to New Mexico.\n\n6 So I think we may have to respond to the jury on that\n7 score as well, which is the fact that they have to be\n\n8 considering New York events for Count Four, rather than -- or\n\n9 violations of New York law, which wouldn't occur in New Mexico\nlo for there to be a conviction on Count Four.\n\nll MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think that's exactly why we\n\nl2 proposed directing the jurors to the entirety of the\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, which says just that. The second paragraph of\n\nl4 that same <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> reminds the jury, as the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> does\nl5 throughout, that we're talking about New York Penal Law,\n\nl6 Section l3o.55. And so I think our proposal remains the same\nl7 that they be referred to the entirety of the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, which\nl8 includes that language, among other aspects of this particular\nl9 element.\n2o THE COURT: Yes.\n2l MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, may I be heard for a moment?\n22 THE COURT: Sure.\n23 MS. STERNHEIM: I think the fact that the jury has\n24 mentioned New Mexico regarding a count that pertains to New\n25 York is not just cleared up by referring them to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool47o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of 29 3l4o\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. Clearly they are making an error concerning which\n2 state begins with \"New.\" And I suggest that if the Court\n\n3 wishes to refer them to the charge, the Court also clears up\n\n4 the fact that Count Four requires a violation of New York law,\n5 not New Mexico law.\n\n6 THE COURT: That's certainly why we should refer them\n7 to the whole charge. That's what lines 7 through lo make\n\n8 clear.\n\n9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nlo The only illegal sexual activity identified in the\n\nll entirety of the jury charge is a statute in New York. There\n\nl2 cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This particular\nl3 charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as\nl4 well. The jury has not been charged about any laws in New\n\nl5 Mexico; so there can't be any risk of confusion for exactly\n\nl6 that reason.\n\nl7 MR. EVERDELL: I just don't understand the confidence\nl8 about hou there can be no possible confusion --\n\nl9 THE COURT: This conversation is stopping.\n2o My decision is to refer them back to this charge,\n2l because it iS a proper <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on the second element to\n22 Count Four.

And so no relief is appropriate here.\n\n3 At botom, your Honor, the jury asked a question and\n\n4 nothing more. There is no reason to speculate about what the\n\n5 jury might be concluding.

The first one is\nl9 about Count Two, which wasn't asked about. There is a second\n2o paragraph.

This is the same\n24 discussion we've had a couple of times, Mr. Everdell.

I think this\n3 is the same basic discussion that we've had. So, in addition\n\n4 to my reasoning yesterday, I think the proposal made by the\n\n5 defense is wrong.\n\n6 I continue to not knou hou to parse the jury's\n\n7 question exactly, other than to knou that they are asking about\n8 Count Four, the defense's original suggestion to just point to\n9 the motivating factor I rejected language or to say no. To say\nlo no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand\nll the question well enough to be able to say no.\nl2 Pointing to just the motivating factor language I\nl3 think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remind\nl4 them of the whole <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, including that it's a violation\nl5 of New York penal law that's charged and is the illegal sexual\nl6 activity that they're considering.\nl7 So, for those reasons, I am in the same place.\nl8 I did want to make a litle bit of an additional\nl9 record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the\n2o instructions that I gave yesterday regarding that slightly\nal extended schedule.\n22 I asked the jury to make themselves available to\n23 deliberate until at least 6:oo today, which is a one-hour\n24 extension of what's largely been our schedule.

I understand it's been rejected by the Court.\n\nll I think from the defense point of view, I think two\n\nl2 things are very clear from this note. One is that the jury is\nl3 considering whether or not they can convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nl4 substantive offense in Count Four based solely on events that\nl5 took place in New Mexico and traveled to and from New Mexico.\nl6 THE COURT: There are a number of assumptions in that\nl7 that don't necessarily derive from the meaning of that leter,\nl8 but I understand that is your position.\n\nl9 MR.

The District Court\ndeclined to reconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and argues that the\nalleged constructive amendment is a per se violation of the Grand Jury\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that\ntestimony about a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the\njury with another basis for conviction, which is distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment.

As I told you, under the law,\n2 a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and cannot\n3 be found guilty of the crimes charged unless a jury, after\n\n4 hearing all of the evidence in the case, unanimously decides\n\n5 that the evidence proves the defendant guilty beyond a\n\n6 reasonable doubt.\n\n7 In a criminal case, the burden of proof remains with\n\n8 the prosecution, the government. For the jury to return a\n\n9 verdict of guilty as to the defendant, the government must\n\nlo prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nll A person charged with a crime has absolutely no burden to prove\nl2 that she's not guilty.

I'll\n4 try to avoid such interruptions as much as possible, but please\n5) be patient and understand that these conferences are necessary\n6 to ensure the fairness of the trial and often make the trial go\n7 faster.\n\n8 While I decide the law that applies to this case, you,\n9 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are the triers of fact.\n\nlo You'll weigh the evidence presented and decide whether the\n\nll government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nl2 defendant is guilty of the charges in the indictment. You must\nl3 pay close atention to all of the evidence presented, and you\nl4 must base your decision only on the evidence in the case and my\nl5 instructions about the law.\n\nl6 What then is evidence?\n\nl7 Evidence consists only of the testimony of witnesses,\nl8 documents, and other things admited as evidence or\n\nl9 stipulations agreed to by the parties. Some of you have\n2o probably heard the term \"circumstantial evidence, direct\n2l evidence.\" Do not be concerned with these terms. You are to\n22 consider all of the evidence given in this trial. Certain\n23 things are not evidence and must not be considered by you. The\n24 follouing is a list of what is not evidence:\n25 First, arguments, statements, and questions by the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9 of lo6 23\nLBTVMAXl\n\nl lawyers are not evidence, nor are statements I make or\n\n2 questions I ask of a witness.\n\n3 Second, objections to questions are not evidence. The\n4 lawyers have an obligation to make an objection when they\n\na believe evidence being offered is improper under the rules of\n\n6 evidence. You should not be influenced by the objection or by\n7 my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the\n8 question and any answer that may have been given. If it's\n\n9 overruled, treat the answer like any other. Tf you're\n\nlo instructed that some item of evidence is received for a limited\nll purpose only, you must follou that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nl2 Third, the testimony that I've excluded or told you to\nl3 disregard is not evidence and must not be considered.\n\nl4 Fourth, anything you may have seen or heard outside\n\nl5 the courtroom is not evidence and must be disregarded. You are\nl6 to decide this case solely on the evidence presented here in\n\nl7 the courtroom.\n\nl8 There is no formula to evaluate testimony or exhibits.\nl9 For nou, suffice it to say that you bring with you into this\n2o courtroom all of the experience and background of your lives.\n2l Do not leave your common sense outside the courtroom. The same\n22 types of tests that you use in your everyday dealings are the\n23 tests that you should apply in deciding hou much weight, if\n24 any, to give to the evidence in this case.\n25 The law does not require you to accept all of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of lo6 27\nLBTVMAXl\n\nl throughout this process, this rule is very, very important.\n\n2 That's because your decision in this case must be made solely\n\n3 on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at this trial.\n\n4 In other words, all that you need to knou will be presented\n\na here in open court by the parties. This is critically\n\n6 important to ensuring a fair trial, which I knou that all of\n\n7 you would want if you were a party in this court, and I have no\n8 doubt it's what you want for the parties who are here today. I\n9 expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you\nlo become aware of another juror's violation of these\n\nll instructions.\n\nl2 Finally, each of you either has or will be given a\n\nl3 notebook and pen; and that's because I do permit jurors to take\nl4 notes.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the\n\n3 defense confuses conspiracy violations and substantive\n\n4 violations. There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 conspiracy count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the island.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the island. That's\n24 not travel to New York. And her mother said she couldn't be\n25 able to go. So I don't think that is evidence -- if the object\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6936\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 95 2749\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl of the conspiracy is to violate New York law, then an\n\n2 invitation to an island that's not New York doesn't count.\n\n3 And also, an invitation to travel to New Mexico to do\n4 whatever it is they were planning on doing in New Mexico is\n\n5) also not a goal of violating New York law. I'm sorry, from\n\n6 Arizona. So there's no connection to New York law with respect\n7 to Annie's testimony either.\n\n8 And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those\n9 two witnesses' testimony, Kate and Annie, or even Carolyn, the\nlo object of this conspiracy, for this to be a crime, it can only\nll be hung on the testimony, at least in the evidence in the\n\nl2 record, the testimony of Jane.

So I\nl6 think here, Mr. Rohrbach, you didn't disagree with substituting\nl7 Jane for an individual?\n\nl8 MR.

I think the jury will be confused by an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n\nll along those lines because it suggests that some amount of\n\nl2 causation is required above the inherent causation in the\n\nl3 statutory terms of inducement or enticement.

I think\n2o this is simply -- the opinion is simply explaining what is\n2l required by those words, \"persuasion,™ \"inducement,\"\n22 \"enticement,\" and those words are the exact same words that are\n23 used in the statute, so I don't think the context of the case\n24 really maters in terms of what those words mean.

It need not have been\n\n3 her only purpose or motivation, but it must have been more than\n4 merely incidental. It must have been one of the dominant\n\n5 purposes of the trip.\n\n6 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, all that the law requires\n\n7 is that it be one of the dominant purposes of the trip, which\n\n8 is the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that the defense originally sought and the\n\n9 Court gave. It's the practice, as Sand endorses, to rephrase\nlo \"dominant\" as \"significant or motivating purpose\" to avoid\n\nll confusion, because it doesn't have to be the sole dominant\n\nl2 purpose, it just has to be a dominant purpose, and so from\n\nl3 Sand, that creates ambiguity that it has to be a sufficient --\nl4 such a big purpose that it's the dominant purpose, which is not\nl5 what is required by the statute. This <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> suggests\n\nl6 there's an additional requirement, which is that it be some\n\nl7 sort of conscious purpose to engage in the particular criminal\nl8 violation suggesting knouledge of the criminal statute and\n\nl9 criminal prohibition. All the Miller case does is affirm that\n2o this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> is not error. It does not say that that is\n2l the required <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> by -- at least as I'm reading the --\n22 I'm reading the Miller case for the first time nou, but it is\n23 an appeal from a conviction on that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. It is not\n24 suggesting that it's required by --\n25 THE COURT: Let me look. I've only read the —-\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3l of 95 2769\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl MR. ROHRBACH: I've only read portions of it too, but\n2 that's my quick read.\n\n3 THE COURT: So the defendant's argument in Miller was\n4 that the prostitution or other criminal sexual activity must be\n5 the dominant purpose of the interstate travel rather than only\n6 one of the dominant purposes as the judge charged.\n\n7 MR. ROHRBACH: In fact, your Honor, I think in light\n\n8 of that conclusion, the final sentence of the defense's\n\n9 proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> would be suggestive of error because the\nlo point is that -- or at least creates the very confusion that\n\nll arose in Miller about whether it has to be one of the dominant\nl2 purposes. The use of the word \"dominant\" is a source of\n\nl3 confusion, as Sand has explained.\n\nl4 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, on that point, the\n\nl5 language \"Significant or motivating purpose\" is completely\n\nl6 invented by Sand, right, and nou people have used it because\n\nl7 Sand is an authority in this area, but that does not -- that\n\nl8 did not come from case law. That is Sand's proposal to deal\n\nl9 with the issue of the dominant purpose versus one dominant\n2o purpose. There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge. So I actually think\n25 there is more support in the case law for the \"one dominant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 32 of 95 277o\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl purpose\" language than language that happened to have been\n\n2 invented by Sand. As smart as Judge Sand was, that did not\n\n3 actually come from any circuit case law. So we propose going\n\n4 with what the courts have actually said on this issue rather\n\n5 than a proposal in Sand.\n\n6 THE COURT: I'm just going to read for a moment.\n\n7 I think I want to start by asking what's wrong with\n\n8 the current <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, the one that you proposed that I\n\n9 adopted?

It is a charge that has been used in other cases,\nl4 and we proposed it, so we obviously think it's acceptable. But\nl5 I think the new proposed charge is a charge that is more\n\nl6 accurate and also tracks the case law development on this point\nl7 because the dominant purpose is actually something that was in\nl8 a Second Circuit opinion and it's, you knou -- Judge Rakoff has\nl9 tried to craft an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in Miller to deal with the issue\n2o of one dominant purpose versus the dominant purpose, but the\nal way that I think the case law has developed in the Second\n22 Circuit, it started with \"dominant purpose\" was the language\n23 used and then we had to deal with this issue of ambiguity\n24 there, and this is hou Judge Rakoff came out, but was still\n25 keeping the \"dominant purpose\" language but clarifying it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 33 of 95 277l\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl only one of the dominant purposes.\n\n2 THE COURT: Let me just note my remarkably crack law\n\n3 clerks have found the follouing case: United States v.

It endorses the Sand language over \"dominant.\"\n\nl2 \"These instructions are legally sound. Neither 'dominant' nor\nl3 \"oredominant' appear in the statutory language. Although we\n\nl4 have previously approved a jury charge that included the phrase\nl5 \"one of the dominant purposes,\" (see, e.g., Miller) we've never\nl6 required such language to appear in a jury charge on 242l.\n\nl7 Indeed, Judge Sand recommends excluding the word 'dominant'\n\nl8 from the charge so as to avoid confusion.\" And then at the end\nl9 of the opinion, \"The charge given by the district court, which\n2o closely tracks the charge outlined by Judge Sand, accurately\n2l and thoroughly conveyed the second element of the crime.\n22 Accordingly, we find no error, much less plain error, in the\n23 jury charge.\"\n24 MR.

So the additional request is --\n6 this is where the issue of the fact that Kate was above the age\n7 of consent and about the fact that -- well, Annie's testimony\n\n8 was not a violation of New York law.

Because it's one thing to give the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nl3 at the time of the testimony -- that is what we asked for and\nl4 we appreciate the Court doing that -- but I think that they\n\nl5 need to be instructed again before they go into deliberations,\nl6 nou having heard l2 plus days of testimony, that what those\n\nl7 considerations -- that testimony they are alloued to consider\nl8 for what purpose, because if they're given an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on\n\nl9 New York law, I think it's time to reiterate in the charge to\n2o them that Kate was over the age of consent and was not\n2l involved -- it cannot be considered illegal sexual activity,\n22 because this is where the illegal sexual activity is defined.\n23 And same with Annie. I have a proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to add\n24 here, but it tracks the language of the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n25 the Court gave, so I don't think it's adding any language.

Adding these instructions would be quite\n2o confusing to the jury. The jury has already heard them. This\nal is the place where there's no reason to give the Kate\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> because these jury instructions state specifically\n23 that the jury may not convict based solely on overt acts that\n24 relate to Kate, and so there is no risk, when these full set of\n25 instructions is read to the jury, that they will think that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 37 of 95 2775\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl they can convict based on the illegal sexual activity as it\n\n2 relates to Kate and as it relates to Annie. Annie only relates\n3 to the conspiracy counts, at least as to these Mann Act\n\n4 charges, and the jury is going to be instructed here that the\n\n5 relevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the\n6 New York offense. So again, there's no risk that the jury will\n7 think that the sexual contact that happened in New Mexico is\n\n8 something that on its oun is sufficient to shou the illegal\n\n9 sexual activity required by the statute.

And there was I think one trip she may have said\n\nl9 she was under the age of l6, which -- l5 or l6 I think is what\n2o she said as to that trip, which we believe is the actual legal\n2l age of consent in New Mexico; but she also testified about\n22 other travel to New Mexico, where events took place, where\n23 sexual contact took place, and so I think with respect to that,\n24 we are going to need some kind of <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to the jury that\n25 if she's above the age of consent in New Mexico, that can't be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 38 of 95 2776\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl considered illegal sexual activity for the purposes of their\n\n2 deliberations.

EVERDELL: Well, let me see about that.\n\n4 Are we talking just about the overt acts with respect\n5 to Jane or are we talking about with Annie as well? Because\n\n6 the overt act with respect to Annie is, she's saying she's\n\n7 under the age of l8, but the age of consent there is l6, so --\n8 and Kate -- there are a few issues here, so I'll just lay them\n) out.\n\nlo The <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> with Annie is, you knou, there's the\nll age of consent issue with Annie. But skipping to Kate, which\nl2 is No. 4, on line l8, I don't think that should be in there at\nl3 all because that invites them to base an overt act and convict\nl4 the defendant based on Kate's testimony, which the Court has\n\nl5 already instructed that the jury can't. So, I mean, if they\n\nl6 found that this element was satisfied solely with Kate's\n\nl7 testimony, that would be an improper conviction. So that\n\nl8 shouldn't be included.\n\nl9 MR. ROHRBACH: Insofar as we'tre no longer follouing\n2o the exact text of the indictment, the government would be fine\nal with deleting the overt act relevant to Kate for the reason\n22 Mr. Everdell stated.\n23 THE COURT: Okay.

So my first\n24 objection is that I don't think you can actually consider\n25 Annie's testimony as the overt act if what's described there is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool6979\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 55 of 95 2793\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl THE COURT: And again, noting that that's why I gave\n\n2 the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for Annie's testimony, that's why the\n3 limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> did differ from the Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n\n4 for Kate, because that is the Court's legal conclusion.\n\n5 MR.

But the second prong is that there\nl2 must be an appropriate factual predicate for the charge. And\nl3 here, your Honor, the government's theory of the case and the\nl4 proof that's been elicited through the testimony is that she\nl5 was an active participant in all aspects of the charges.

An argument\nlo that these people were older is so intertwined with an argument\n\nll that she thought these people were older that, even if they\nl2 didn't say the words about that in their closing, I think the\nl3 jury would assume that, absent some more affirmative\nl4 stipulation, so the government would have to rebut it. A\nl5 conscious avoidance theory is an appropriate way to do so.\nl6 THE COURT: Yes. It's a fair point. And I'm going to\nl7 look carefully at relevant portions of the transcript, but I do\nl8 think it is sufficiently in issue that it's appropriate to give\nl9 the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. I would consider, as part of my calculus in\n2o coming to a final resolution, if the defense were to indicate\n2l it wouldn't specifically make that argument. But --\n22 MS.

I assume\n\n2 the defendant is going to say that she didn't knou the purposes\n3 of the trips. To the extent the purpose was sexual abuse, the\n4 government would argue that at a minimum this she did knou, if\n5 she didn't she consciously avoided knouing, why Jeffrey Epstein\n6 was traveling repeatedly with these minors.\n\n7 THE COURT: The other point is, from the openings, I\n\n8 don't knou if it will be a theme of the closing, but the\n\n) distancing of Ms. Maxwell from Mr. Epstein and what he did was\nlo clearly a theme of the opening, and so that implicates\n\nll knouledge throughout the counts.\n\nl2 So my strong inclination is that it's appropriate\n\nl3 here. That's my conclusion. That's my conclusion. I'm going\nl4 to look back through relevant portions of testimony on the age\nl5 issue, but I think even the age issue -- well, not the age\n\nl6 issue. Knouledge of age. Specific arguments as to knouledge\nl7 of age aside, knouledge of age is intertwined with arguments\n\nl8 regarding age. And in any event, there are, as a result of the\nl9 opening, questions about Ms. Maxwell's knouledge of what\n2o Mr. Epstein is alleged to have been doing that I think it's\n2l sort of a standard instance of the applicability of a conscious\n22 avoidance <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n23 So my conclusion is to include it.\n24 Next.\n25 MR.

The government does have the option of\n\nl8 giving those witnesses immunity to testify. And so they\n\nl9 actually control, more than we do, whether or not a witness can\n2o appear —-\n2l THE COURT: To be clear, that didn't happen. They\n22 didn't call that witness.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: We had a witness who invoked their\n24 Fifth Amendment rights or had writen the Court that they\n25 planned to invoke, and that we called and was under subpoena\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7ool\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 77 of 95 28l5\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl So there is more than just the one witness who indicated that\n\n2 she was going to invoke had the defense called her. There were\n3 other co-conspirators who the government chose not to call, not\n4 to immunize, and we couldn't possibly call in our defense\n\n5 without -- because we can't give any immunity ourselves.\n\n6 MR.

Congress has deemed it\n\nl9 appropriate to make conspiracy standing alone a separate crime,\n2o even if the object of the conspiracy is not achieved. The\n2l essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement or\n22 understanding to violate other laws. Thus, if a conspiracy\n23 exists, even if it fails, it's still punishable as a crime.\n24 Consequently, in a conspiracy charge, there's no need to prove\n25 that the crime that was the objective of the conspiracy was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool72l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l96 of 257 3o3o\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl actually commited.\n\n2 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that\n3 the crime charge was actually commited, but do not require\n\n4 proof of an agreement.

Assume that when you came\nl9 into the courthouse this morning, the sun was shining and it\n2o was a nice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom\n2l windous that are drawn and you can't look outside. As you're\n22 siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that's dripping\n23 wet.

I think the answer is clearly yes, made all the\n2l more so by the fact that Annie's testimony or a part of it is\n22 referenced as an overt act in the indictment in the\n23 instructions.

EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think the answer to this\n7 question is no, and I'll tell you the rationale for this.\n\n8 As to the jurors' note, they've clearly separated out\n9 in their minds the flight to New Mexico versus the flight back\nlo from New Mexico. And in their minds, there still is a\n\nll question, it would seem, that the flight -- whatever the\n\nl2 purpose of the flight to New Mexico was, whether it was for\n\nl3 illicit sexual activity or not, that is different from the\n\nl4 purpose of the flight back from New Mexico. And they are\n\nl5 asking can she be found guilty solely on if there's some aiding\nl6 and abeting, some helping of that flight from New Mexico,\n\nl7 which presumably the flight home they're saying.\n\nl8 THE COURT: So the flight from New Mexico to where?\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, there is no record of a flight\n2o from New Mexico. But what they are saying, I think, in this\n2l note is they are separating out in their minds the flight to\n22 New Mexico versus whatever flight she may have taken from New\n23 Mexico. And I would say based on the instructions in the\n24 Court's instructions which the government pointed to, there has\n25 to be -- the significant or motivating purpose of the travel\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool73l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l4 of 29 3l3l\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl We can't tell which flight we're talking about, which\n2 leg of a potentially multi-leg trip we're talking about. And\n\n3 so I think here, again, the Court gave a thorough <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\n\n4 about this particular element. Because we can't tell which set\n5) of facts they are asking about, I think the proper course here\n6 is to refer the jury to the particulars with respect to this\n\n7 element.\n\n8 THE COURT: It's difficult to knou and to have in my\n\n9 head, based on the articulation of the question, as well as the\nlo testimony, exactly what they are referring to. I don't knou.\nll So I am inclined to follou the government's suggestion\nl2 here and to say, I can't provide an additional response to your\nl3 question other than to consider carefully the instructions as\nl4 to -- I mean, I could either point them to all of the count or\nl5 specifically to the second element, since that's what they're\nl6 asking about.\n\nl7 MR.

And I think simply saying it's confusing --\n\n6 THE COURT: Well, I find it confusing. For example, I\n7 don't knou if this is a question about aiding and abeting. I\n8 don't knou.\n\n9 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think this is prety —- I\nlo think this is a question about whether you can hold her\n\nll accountable for a return flight, if you believe that she had\n\nl2 something to do with arranging that return flight from New\n\nl3 Mexico; whereas the first flight to New Mexico may have been --\nl4 at least there's some testimony to consider about whether that\nl5 was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. It was not\n\nl6 true of the return flight, the flight back, wherever she was\n\nl7 going, home, somewhere else, somewhere away from Mr. Epstein.\nl8 I think they are asking, Can we consider if Ms.\n\nl9 Maxwell had anything to do with that flight, arranging of that\n2o flight, whether she can be convicted, because it's on the\n2l return trip from an area where Jane claims she was involved in\n22 sexual abuse.\n23 THE COURT: But it says where/if the intent was to\n24 engage -- for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n25 MR. EVERDELL: Right. They are saying with a flight\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool73l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 29 3l33\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl to New Mexico, where/if there was an intent for Jane to engage\n2 in sexual activity. So there is still an open question in\n\ni) their minds about whether the flight to New Mexico, that\n\n4 travel, was for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual\n\n5 activity.\n\n6 But they are nou considering whether the flight out of\n7 New Mexico, if Ms. Maxwell had any -- did anything to do with\n\n8 that flight, with arranging that flight, could we convict her\n\n9 on that count alone. Because there is no, I think, evidence\n\nlo that she arranged the flight going to New Mexico; instead, they\nll are considering nou whether there's any evidence that she may\nl2 have arranged the flight out of New Mexico. And is that enough\nl3 to provide a conviction on Count Two? And I think the answer\nl4 to that is prety clearly no -- I'm sorry, Count Four I should\nl5 have said, not Count Two. Because there's no evidence of that.\nl6 And there is also -- there is no -- in the\n\nl7 instructions themselves, that would not be a significant or\n\nl8 motivating purpose for that travel across state lines. That\n\nl9 would simply be for her to return home. That's not travel for\n2o the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity.\n2l MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think this colloguy\n22 illustrates hou confusing the note is. We are nou guessing at\n23 what hypothetical facts the jury is talking about; and then\n24 guessing hypothetically what their legal question is on top of\n25 that. And I think we're compounding guesswork, what this\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool732o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel7 of 29 3l34\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl question is about. And so the question is about the element;\n\n2 the charge is about that particular element. I think more\n\n3 guesswork here makes this more confusing and not less\n\n4 confusing. I think, as the Court pointed out, some aspects of\na this note are about aiding and abeting. And so even referring\n6 the jury just to <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> number 2l leaves out that aspect\n\n7 of the jury's deliberations and their determination on this\n\n8 particular issue. And so we think the safest course is to\n\n9 provide the jury with applicable law in this area, and they can\nlo find the facts as they see fit and as they apply to these\n\nll particular instructions.\n\nl2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think this is a\n\nl3 question about aid and abeting, broadly speaking. I think\n\nl4 they are talking about the flights to and from New Mexico. I\nl5 think that much is prety clear from the note. And whether or\nl6 not Ms. Maxwell had anything to do with arranging that\n\nl7 travel —-\n\nl8 THE COURT: But your legal contention is she can't be\nl9 found guilty of this count unless the jury concludes that she\n2o aided in the transportation to New Mexico.\n2l That's not legally accurate, is it?\n22 MR.

And the jury is free to senda\n2l clarifying note, if they wish to do so. But I think when we\n22 are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it's\n23 unclear which clauses are modifying which clauses, or which\n24 flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too\n25 confusing to give simple answers here.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2l of 29 3l38\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl THE COURT: I can't answer this ambiguous guestion no.\n2 I don't knou that the answer is no, even with the ambiguity;\n\n3 because I don't knou if what they have in mind is an aiding and\n4 abeting question, which we haven't discussed yet.\n\n5) MS.

I won't assume that's the\n\n7 question for purposes of the answer, but I also don't assume\n\n8 the meaning that you've put on it for purposes of the answer.\n\n9 So the only solution here is to say, I direct you to consider\nlo the full <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on Element 2 of Count Four on page 28.\n\nll MS.

STERNHEIM: Judge, may I be heard for a moment?\n22 THE COURT: Sure.\n23 MS.

Clearly they are making an error concerning which\n2 state begins with \"New.\" And I suggest that if the Court\n\n3 wishes to refer them to the charge, the Court also clears up\n\n4 the fact that Count Four requires a violation of New York law,\n5 not New Mexico law.\n\n6 THE COURT: That's certainly why we should refer them\n7 to the whole charge. That's what lines 7 through lo make\n\n8 clear.\n\n9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nlo The only illegal sexual activity identified in the\n\nll entirety of the jury charge is a statute in New York.

Nothing has changed between then and\nl8 nou.\n\nl9 In particular, the defense's leter identifies no\n2o error in the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> the Court referred the jury to nor\nal could they. It was a correct legal <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> when the Court\n22 instructed the jury last week, it was a correct legal\n23 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> when the Court referred the jury to it yesterday\n24 afternoon, and that it remains true. It was a thorough and\n25 carefully considered <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on the legal elements and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document775 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3 of l6 3l49\nLCSCMAXT\n\nl there can be no error in referring the jury to a correct legal\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. And so no relief is appropriate here.\n\n3 At botom, your Honor, the jury asked a question and\n\n4 nothing more. There is no reason to speculate about what the\n\n5 jury might be concluding. The jury has been accurately\n\n6 instructed on the law and that's all that's required here.\n\n7 Going beyond that to speculate about the jury's deliberations\n\n8 and compound speculation upon speculation to send back\n\n9 confusing legal instructions would compound the problem here.\nlo The simple course is exactly the course the Court took\n\nll yesterday, which is to refer the jury to a thorough and\n\nl2 complete and accurate legal <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. There can't be any\n\nl3 dispute that the instructions that the Court has given are\n\nl4 accurate, and that's all that's required here.\n\nl5 THE COURT: I suppose an additional point, just\n\nl6 looking at the -- I mean, the defense's new proposed\n\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> talks about Count Two, which wasn't asked about.\n\nl8 Also, it has -- so it has three paragraphs. The first one is\nl9 about Count Two, which wasn't asked about. There is a second\n2o paragraph. And then the third paragraph I think is just wrong,\n2l an intent that Jane engaged in sexual activity in any state\n22 other than New York cannot form the basis of these elements.\n23 That would suggest it may have no relevance. This is the same\n24 discussion we've had a couple of times, Mr. Everdell. Sexual\n25 activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document775 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4ofl6 3l5o\nLCSCMAXT\n\nl can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage\n2 in sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this\n3 is the same basic discussion that we've had. So, in addition\n\n4 to my reasoning yesterday, I think the proposal made by the\n\n5 defense is wrong.\n\n6 I continue to not knou hou to parse the jury's\n\n7 question exactly, other than to knou that they are asking about\n8 Count Four, the defense's original suggestion to just point to\n9 the motivating factor I rejected language or to say no. To say\nlo no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand\nll the question well enough to be able to say no.\nl2 Pointing to just the motivating factor language I\nl3 think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remind\nl4 them of the whole <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, including that it's a violation\nl5 of New York penal law that's charged and is the illegal sexual\nl6 activity that they're considering.\nl7 So, for those reasons, I am in the same place.\nl8 I did want to make a litle bit of an additional\nl9 record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the\n2o instructions that I gave yesterday regarding that slightly\nal extended schedule.\n22 I asked the jury to make themselves available to\n23 deliberate until at least 6:oo today, which is a one-hour\n24 extension of what's largely been our schedule. Although, it\n25 was until 6 o'clock, I think, on the first night of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document775 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6 of l6 3l52\nLCSCMAXT\n\nl request of the leter, but if I could make a brief record on\n\n2 that, it will not take very long.\n\n3 THE COURT: Okay.

EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.\n2o And I think the second point is that they are Looking\n2l at the instructions that they have been given thus far because\n22 they reference the second element of Count Four. So they're\n23 looking at that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> and they are unclear, they are\n24 confused by those instructions. They are not sure whether or\n25 not -- those instructions don't inform them that, in fact,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document775 Filed o8/lo/22 Page /7 of l6 3l53\nLCSCMAXT\n\nl conduct that occurs solely in New Mexico, travels to and from\n\n2 New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a\n\n3 violation of New York law —-\n\n4 THE COURT: Again, using your language, cannot form a\n5 basis, would suggest it is irrelevant.

I think the jury is saying that they may\n22 convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on conduct that solely\n23 relates to New Mexico. I am not saying it is irrelevant.

The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.\n\n5 As the government has indicated, because Kate was over\n6 the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time\n\n7 that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's\n8 not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this\n9 basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as\n\nlo irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I\n\nll concluded based on the government's proffer that she has\n\nl2 relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act\n\nl3 counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 4o4(b).\nl4 To avoid jury confusion and prejudice, houever, I\n\nl5 concluded that her testimony should be limited in the\n\nl6 description of details of the sexual conduct that does not form\nl7 a basis of the charged counts and that a Limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nl8 was required.\n\nl9 Over the weekend, the government asked for me to\n2o include in the limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> a statement that I\n2l instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual\n22 conduct that the witness will testify occurred with\n23 Mr. Epstein.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week.

Based on all of the information nou before the Court,\nincluding a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated\ntestimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43,\nthe Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct\nevidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order\n***].

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

Before the Court is\nthe Defendant's fourth motion in limine to \"exclude evidence related to Accuser—3,\" to\nwhom the Court refers as Witness—3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of\nEvidence 4o4(b) and 4o3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument\nrelated to this motion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing\nthat was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l\nTranscript; Nov. lo, 2o2l Transcript. At the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court\nprovided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then\nbefore it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The\nCourt is nou in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to\nresolve the motion.(See Footnote l on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The\nGovernment nou proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness—3 will describe\nhou she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.\nIn particular, Witness—3 is anticipated to testify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr.\nEpstein, hou massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role\nin facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information nou before the Court,\nincluding a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated\ntestimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43,\nthe Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct\nevidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order\n***].

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

(Rohrbach,\nAndrew) (Entered: o4/25/2o22)\n\no4/26/2o22 | 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by\nJudge Alison J. Nathan on 4/26/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o4/26/2o22)\n\no4/29/2o22 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order\n***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o573\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020589.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l8, o7/l5/2o22, 3348724, Page‘ of 2\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nDEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON CATHERINE O'HAGAN WOLFE\nCHIEF JUDGE CLERK OF COURT\nDate: July l5, 2o22 DC Docket #: l:2o-cr-33o-l\nDocket #: 22-l426 DC Court: SDNY (NEW YORK\nShort Title: United States of America v.

The Court has twice heard argument related to this\nmotion, including argument at the November lo, 2o2l in camera hearing that was sealed\npursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2. See generally Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript; Nov.\nlo, 2o2l Transcript. At the November l, 2o2l hearing, the Court provided a brief\nexplanation of its current position based on the information then before it, but the Court\nultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The Court is nou in receipt of the\nparties' additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to resolve the motion.(See\nFootnote l on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The Government nou proffers that\nthe anticipated testimony of Witness-3 will describe hou she met the Defendant and her\nrelationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. In particular, Witness-3 is anticipated to\ntestify hou Defendant introduced her to Mr. Epstein, hou massages progressed to involve\nsexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role in facilitating those massages.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a\nlawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a\nwitness. N.Y. R. Prof] Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the\ndeposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not\nrequired to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020789.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993).

The phrase \"to transport an individual in\n\nl2 interstate commerce\" means to move or carry or cause someone to\nl3 be moved or carried from one state to another.\n\nl4 The government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell\nl5 personally transported Jane across a state line; it is\n\nl6 sufficient to satisfy the element that Ms. Maxwell was actively\nl7 engaged, either personally or through an agent, in the making\nl8 of the travel arrangements such as by purchasing tickets\n\nl9 necessary for Jane to travel as planned. Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce. That means that the government must prove\n22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be\n23 transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate\n24 commerce.

And in their minds, there still is a\nll question, it would seem, that the flight -—- whatever the\nl2 purpose of the flight to New Mexico was, whether it was for\nl3 illicit sexual activity or not, that is different from the\nl4 purpose of the flight back from New Mexico.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to request that the Court give the jury additional\ninstructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the\nlaw applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court\nExhibit #l5).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 reads, in relevant part, as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), [l]f the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nCount Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida\nto New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would engage in one\nor more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” S82\nInd. ¥ 2l (emphasis added).\n\nIn response to the note, the Court referred the jury to <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2l of the jury charge.\nThe defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020850.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Court has\nrecently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance. “To prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect\naltered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of\nthe offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been\nconvicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-\ncr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the\ndoctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a\nconstructive amendment constitutes a “per se violation’ of the defendant’s constitutional nghts—\ni.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou the\ngovernment proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general\nterms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms\nmay be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at\ntrial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d.

New York City,\n27l F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir. 2ool). Reversal is “required where, based on a review of the record as a\nwhole, the error was prejudicial or the charge was highly confusing.” Kopstein, 759 F.3d at l72;\nsee also id. (“A charge that appears likely to have left the jury ‘highly confused’ may, on that\nground alone, be reversed.” (quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v.

BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020950.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire.

For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside). In closing,\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o95o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020960.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel34 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020962.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel36 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\n\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt. No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020967.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 24 of 4o\nl. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. Id. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was responsive and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” Jd. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020981.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel55 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll-l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” Jd. at4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l. The Court confirmed that Juror 5o “carefully” folloued the Court’s instructions during voir\ndire and trial. Id.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o98l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020982.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel56 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021005.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel79 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 22 of 45\nprejudicial variance. For the follouing reasons, the Court disagrees and denies the Defendant’s\nmotion on this basis.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “a defendant has the right to be tried\nonly on charges contained in an indictment returned by a grand jury.” United States v. Wozniak,\nl26 F.3d lo5, lo9 (2d Cir. l997). “[W]hen the charge upon which the defendant is tried differs\nsignificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive amendment\noccurs and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F Ath 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that either\nthe proof at trial or the trial court’s jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge\nthat, upon review, it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62o (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (quoting United States v. Frank, l56 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir. l998)). In making this\ndetermination, the Court first delineates the “core of criminality” of the crime alleged. United\nStates v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd\nsub nom. United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality...\ninvolves the essence of a crime, in general terms.” United States v. Daugerdas, 837 F.3d 2l2,\n225 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l8\n(2d Cir. 2ol2)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial\ncreated a “substantial likelihood” that the defendant was not convicted of the crime described in\nthat core, but instead of a crime “distinctly different.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l6,4l9. The\nSecond Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof, provided that the\ndefendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.” United States v.\n\nye.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021006.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel8o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 23 of 45\nBanki, 685 F.3d 99, ll8 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8, 228 (2d\nCir. 2oo7)). Thus, the defendant must shou that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions\ntied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the\nindictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 77o F.3d 2l2, 223 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (emphasis added)\n(quoting United States v. Danielson, l99 F.3d 666, 67o (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nBy contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left\nunaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the\nindictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l (quoting Hrank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the\ndistinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear “merely one of degree,’\nthere is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is\nconsidered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must shou\nprejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, l56 F.3d at 337 n.5); see\nalso Rigas, 49o F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must shou ‘substantial prejudice’\nto warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a\nvariance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of\na character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance ls not such as\nto deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same\noffense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l-22). Moreover, when\na defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she\nwas unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 49o F.3d ll9, l29-3o (2d\nCir. 2oo7).\n\nFinally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule\n33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021007.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel8l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 24 of 45\njustice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). Such a motion is granted “sparingly and in the most\nextraordinary circumstances, and only in order to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.”\nUnited States v. Gramins, 939 F.3d 429, 444 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (cleaned up).\n\nB. No constructive amendment occurred.\n\nCount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an individual under the age of\nseventeen with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, and Count Three charged a conspiracy\nto do the same. The core of criminality of these counts, the parties agree, was a scheme by\nEpstein and the Defendant to cause underage girls to travel to New York with the intent that they\nwould engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. Gov. Br. at 6; Maxwell Br. at 9.4\n\nThe Defendant contends that a jury note received during deliberations revealed that the\njury convicted the Defendant on a crime different from this core of criminality. Namely, the\nDefendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the jury found she intended for Jane to\nengage in sexual activity in New Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity in New York. Maxwell Reply at 2. She argues the Court’s decision to refer the\njury back to the charge and refusal to give a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> was error. As a result of\nthis same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her of Count Three. For the reasons\nthat follou, the Court concludes that there is not a “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant\nwas “convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l6 (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729 (2d Cir. l988)).\n\n4 The Defendant also contends that her conviction on Count One was the result of a constructive amendment.\nBecause the Court will not enter judgment on Count One per the parties’ consent, the Court does not address Count\nOne here. In any event, the Defendant’s argument as to why Count One was constructively amended is the same as\nher argument as to Count Three, and the Court’s analysis would be the same. See Maxwell Br. at l6.\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021008.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel82 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 25 of 45\nl. The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s\nsummation captured the core of criminality.\n\nFirst, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence\ncaptured the core of criminality. As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with\nfour counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual\nknoun to be under the age of seventeen. Jury Charge at 24. The jury charge made clear that this\nprovision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four. See id. at\n23-24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had\nknouingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of\nNew York Penal Law Section l3o.55, as alleged in the Indictment). The Court also accepted the\nDefendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York\nlaw. See, e.g., Request to Charge at l9, 23, 26, 3o, 3l, Dkt. No. 4lo-l; Jury Charge at 2o, 24,\n26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an\nunspecified “criminal offense’’).\n\nThe jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s\nassessment of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, Counts One and Three. The charge explained\nthat the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count\nTwo. See Jury Charge at 44-45. In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the\nenticement of minors to travel and the transport of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage\nin sexual activity illegal under New York law. See id. As for the overt acts, the Court, at the\nparties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment. Trial Tr. at 278l-82.\nRather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts. Jury Charge at 49-5o. For Counts One and\nThree, this included the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>: “the Indictment alleges as follous: .. .

These instructions\npertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55. The first limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> pertained to Kate. This <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> informed.\nthe jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of\nKate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.\nat ll67-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021010.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel84 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\ncommercial flights. /d. at 3l6.

See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lolo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021011.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel85 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt.

No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\n<span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.

The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021013.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel87 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3o of 45\n\nto the second element. Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\ninterpretation when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v.

The jury was free to send a clarifying or further note\nfollouing the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nBy contrast, the Defendant failed to propose a legally accurate response for the jury. Her\nproposed responses to the note on the day it was received and the follouing morning were\nerroneous. At the time the Court received the note and discussed it with counsel, the Defendant\nfirst proposed that the answer to the note’s question was simply “no” because, she argued, a\nreturn flight is for the purpose of returning home, “not for the purpose of illegal sexual activity.”\nTrial Tr. at 3l28-3o. But the Court could not respond “no” to an ambiguous question. /d. at\n3l38. Moreover, the Defendant eventually conceded the principle that assistance with a return\nflight home could aid and abet a trip that was for the purpose of illegal sexual activity. See id. at\n3l36. Alternatively, the Defendant requested that if the Court were to refer the jury to the\ncharge, that it direct the jury to lines l4 to l7 of <span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2l, which instructed on\n“significant or motivating purpose.” /d. at 3l3l. But it was unclear that those particular lines\naddressed the jury’s question, and the Court’s decision to refer the jury to the entirety of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Instruction</span> No. 2l encompassed those lines.\n\nThe follouing day, although the jury had not sought further clarification, the Defendant\ntook another pass at proposing an additional response to the note. She requested a three-\nparagraph supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> that referenced elements of Counts Two and Four. See Dkt.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021015.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel89 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 32 of 45\n\nNo. 566.’ The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special\nprominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v.

But the charge as a\nwhole already made clear that a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55 was the key\ninquiry.

No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2-l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021017.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel9l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 34 of 45\nran the risk of moving the jury away from consideration of the core of criminality alleged in the\nIndictment.®\n\nThe appropriate approach was to instruct the jury on the one and only predicate state\noffense for the Mann Act counts charged in the Indictment: New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised.\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony. Trial Tr. at\n2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774—75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on\nthe predicate state offense of New York law. The jury is presumed to have folloued these\ninstructions. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nAt botom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that\nthe jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in\nNew York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in\nNew Mexico. It ls hardly plausible, let alone substantially likely, that this was the jury’s\n8 The Defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> on other jurisdictions’ ages of consent first stated that “[t]o prove Counts\nOne and Three, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent\nthat the minors would engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.”\nRequest to Charge at 5l.

The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021020.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel94 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 37 of 45\nrequest a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that\nshe was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no indication\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> in the jury charge and a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)). The Defendant “must shou both\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021027.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2ol of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 44 of 45\nwould have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence\npresented at trial, including the testimony of Juan Alessi and an email chain between the\nDefendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to\ncreate the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and.\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated.\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021135.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page88 of ll3\nbrother to be family (#49) and that he did not consider sexual abuse a crime (#25),\nhis answers border on the absurd.\n\nA review of Juror 5o’s statements to the media and hearing testimony\nreveals that, after he retained and was advised by counsel, he took great pains to\ndounplay his prior sexual abuse.

The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>\nto the jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a\nconviction on Count Four because it was not a violation of New York law.\nInstead, the Court directed the jury to the existing jury charge for Count Four.\nThe jury ultimately convicted Maxwell on Count Four and the two Mann Act\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021137.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page9o of ll3\nA238\n\nThe second element of Count Four in the Jury Charge to which the jury\nplainly refers requires “that Maxwell knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,”\nnamely, “New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55, sexual abuse in the third\ndegree.” Tr. 3o37:lo-l9\n\nB.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez.

Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\n2. That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3. Try to work it out.\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what\nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact\nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make\nit less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021364.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l9o | 3536o38, Pagel92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021397.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page225 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nie U.S. Department of Fustice\nSir Federal Bureau of Investigation\nel : i i FBI - West Palm Beach\nae pl Suite 3oo\nba 5o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) §33-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 28, 2oo6\nRe: Cate Neriter\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal\ncrime.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8.

Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. .

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021467.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page37 of 2l7\nSA-29l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29l of 348\nIV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

Judge Nathan also instructed the\njury on one and only one predicate state offense: a vio-\nlation of N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o34, 3o37). The\ninstructions on Count Three incorporated this discus-\nsion of the elements of Count Four, and the only stat-\nute identified was N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o49-\n5o, 3o56-57).\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing\n\nnote:\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided\nin the transportation of Jane’s return\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico\nwhere/if the intent was for Jane to en-\ngage in sexual activity, can she be found\nguilty under the second element?\n(Tr.3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the\nconclusion of which Judge Nathan determined she\nshould refer the jury back to the jury charge on the\nsecond element of Count Four because the jury note\nwas otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-\ngally.” (Tr.3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, Maxwell filed a leter seeking reconsid-\neration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the\npossibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial\nvariance because, in her view, the note shoued that\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021729.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page82 of 93\n69\n\nthe jury might convict based on Jane’s testimony that\nshe was abused in New Mexico. (A.224-25). Maxwell\nasked Judge Nathan to instruct the jury as to the in-\ntent elements of Counts Two and Four, and add that\n“[ajln intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any\nstate other than New York cannot form the basis of\nthese two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (A.229).\n\nJudge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s request both be-\ncause the jury did not inquire about Count Two and\nbecause the final sentence as “just wrong” in suggest-\ning that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity\noutside of New York “may have no relevance.”\n(Tr.3l49). As Judge Nathan explained, “This is the\nsame discussion we've had a couple of times .... Sex-\nual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under\nthe age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to transport\nto New York to engage in sexual activity under the age\nof l7....” (Tr.3l49-5o). Judge Nathan repeated that\nshe did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question ex-\nactly,” but that her <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> directing the jury to the\noriginal charge included a reminder that “it’s a viola-\ntion of New York penal law that’s charged and is the\nillegal sexual activity that theyre considering.”\n(Tr.3l5o). Judge Nathan also pointed out that Max-\nwell did not “seek to exclude” Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, or “seek a limiting <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> with re-\nspect to that testimony.” (Tr.3l53). Judge Nathan\nadded “I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking\nor many other plausible readings,” noted that the de-\nfense had proposed an “incorrect” <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, and con-\ncluded no more was required than sending the jury\n“back to the charge.” (Tr.3l54).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021730.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page83 of 93\n7o\nB.

Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\nthe terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which\nso modify essential elements of the offense that there is\na substantial likelihood that the defendant may have\nbeen convicted of an offense other than that charged in\nthe indictment.” United States v.

Lebedev, 932 F.3d 4o, 53 (2d\nCir. 2ol9). The “core of criminality” is “the essence of\na crime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of\nhou a defendant effected the crime.” D’Amelio, 693\nF.3d at 4l8.

Dove, 884 F.3d\nat l46, l49.\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThere is no likelihood—much less a substantial\nlikelihood—that the jury convicted Maxwell solely be-\ncause Jane was transported to New Mexico. At no\npoint during the trial, including its summation, did the\nGovernment argue that the jury could convict on a the-\nory that Maxwell intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico. Similarly, the District Court’s charge required\nthe jury to decide whether Maxwell intended to violate\nNew York law. The trial contained no instructions de-\nscribing for the jury any particular criminal statute in\nNew Mexico, or any other basis by which a jury could\nconvict based on conduct in New Mexico.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l73l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021732.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page85 of 93\n72\n\nMaxwell’s argument to the contrary rests entirely\non her reading of the jury note. According to Maxwell,\nthe note shous that the jury “decided that there was\nno corroborating evidence that Maxwell was present\nfor, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s trips to New\nYork, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Max-\nwell was present for Jane’s trip to New Mexico.”\n(Br.79). This reading, she claims, is butressed by the\nfact that the jury acquited on Count Two, which, in\nher telling, shous that the jury “determined that the\nonly corroborating evidence linking Maxwell to the\nNew Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she\n‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take\nthe trip.” (Br.79).\n\nJudge Nathan correctly rejected this argument.\nJudge Nathan found that the original jury instructions\nand the Government’s summation captured the core of\ncriminality charged in the Indictment, focusing specif-\nically on conduct directed at and sexual activity in New\nYork. (A.382-85). Even if the note revealed that the\njury were confused and wondered whether it could con-\nvict based on conduct in New Mexico, Judge Nathan’s\nresponse ameliorated that confusion. As Judge Nathan\nexplained, she sent the jury back to the <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>,\nwhich “accurately instructed that Count Four had to\nbe predicated on finding a violation of New York Law.”\n(A.387). That was sufficient. See United States v.\nRommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (court “enjoys\nconsiderable discretion” in “framing a response” to a\njury note and “is only required to answer the particu-\nlar inquiries posed’). As Judge Nathan explained,\nMaxwell failed to propose a_ beter response,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l732\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021733.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page86 of 93\n73\n\nrequesting instead a series of instructions that were\n“unresponsive, “redundant,” and “legally inaccurate.”\n(A.388-89). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (court re-\nsponding to jury note “is not required to reference spe-\ncific arguments advanced or defenses raised by counsel\nin urging particular outcomes’). Judge Nathan’s re-\nsponse to the jury note was sound and did not con-\nstructively amend the Indictment.\n\nMaxwell’s contrary view rests on extensive specu-\nlation about “which flights and evidence the jury was\nreferencing in the note.” (A.386). The trial included,\namong other evidence, testimony by Jane about “tak-\ning numerous flights both on Epstein’s private plane\nand on commercial carriers.” (A.386). Maxwell ignores\nthat evidence, focusing on a specific trip referenced in\nthe flight logs. (Br.78-79). Even if Maxwell correctly\nidentified the flight at issue, it still betrayed no jury\nconfusion. The origin of that trip was New York, and\nthe jury’s focus was on the “return flight”’—which it\ncould have inferred was a flight to New York, where\nMaxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\nHer view also rests on adopting one specific reading\nof a note that, as Judge Nathan explained, was “decid-\nedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question being\nasked” (A.386). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (district\ncourt “enjoys considerable discretion in construing the\nscope of a jury inquiry”). Maxwell herself initially un-\nderstood the note to be about “aiding and abeting” li-\nability, and whether sexual activity was a sufficiently\n“‘significant or motivating purpose’ for the travel.”\n(A.387); see United States v. Kim, 47l F.

Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. l992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context\nargument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).\n\nFor the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or\nconspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the\nforegoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees\nfalsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of\nwhat other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas\nbelieved falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the\ncharges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l372 (2d Cir. l985)\n(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United\nStates v.

And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial,\nfor the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged\nhere, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez.

Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\n2. That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3. Try to work it out.\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what\nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact\nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make\nit less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.tif": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023234.tif": "C.

August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n27 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023235.tif": "aioe U.S, Department of Fug lice\nAgree Federal Bureau of Tevesligalion\nae Ti: it FB] - West Palm Peach\nae 5o5 South Mtagler Drive\nWest Pola Beach.

Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.7”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n289 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023243.tif": "Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.””” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.”** Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n292 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n293 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto ... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023251.tif": "she would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.’?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\n3l3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2325l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023253.tif": "in Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . .. and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n3l6 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023255.tif": "informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\n\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°*! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater.

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing.

The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span>, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023310.tif": "argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023313.tif": "the federal investigation I was cooperating in.

Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email <span class=\"highlight\">instruction</span> and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate.
