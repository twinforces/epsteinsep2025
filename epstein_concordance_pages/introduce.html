The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v.

Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v.

Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes.

R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l4 of l9\nabout an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies, even though the Mann Act Counts\nhave nothing to do with Giuffre and are based on an entirely separate time period. The jury will\nalso need to be instructed on the elements of civil defamation and the various defenses, and they\nwill need to evaluate whether the alleged perjurious statements were material to the defamation\naction. At the time the defamation case was dismissed, more than 5o substantive motions were\npending before the District Court. Resolution of the materiality question would necessarily\ninvolve adjudicating those motions. Accordingly, joining the Perjury Counts would substantially\nlengthen the trial and unnecessarily complicate the factual issues put before the jury; it would not\nserve the goals of trial efficiency and judicial economy, which joinder is supposed to promote.\nSee Turoff, 853 F.2d at lo42-43; Werner, 62o F.2d at 928; Halper, 59o F.2d at 43o.\n\nA joint trial with the Perjury Counts would also substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell\nbecause it would necessarily <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> allegations of purported sex abuse from l999-2oo2 for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally and which is well outside of the time\nperiod alleged in the Mann Act Counts. The Palm Beach Police Department thoroughly\ninvestigated allegations of Epstein’s sexual abuse in the early-mid 2ooos and did not find any\nevidence against Ms. Maxwell. The documents produced in discovery shou that none of the\nmore than 3o alleged victims who were interviewed in that investigation testified that they met,\ntalked to, or identified Ms. Maxwell as someone involved with Epstein’s alleged scheme.\nMoreover, had the government credited Ms. Giuffre’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, it would\nno doubt have charged Ms. Maxwell in the 2ol9 indictment, which charged Epstein alone with\nsex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. It did not. Allouing the government to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>\npurported evidence of an uncharged and unsubstantiated conspiracy with Epstein through the\nvehicle of the Perjury Counts would be extremely prejudicial and create a substantial risk that the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l5 of l9\njury would convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act Counts based on a false inference of criminal\npropensity. Similarly, it would create a substantial risk that the jury will confuse the legal and\nfactual issues pertinent to the Perjury Counts and convict Ms. Maxwell without independently\nconsidering those counts. See Ramos, 2oo9 WL l6l99l2, at *2 (severing “temporally distinct”\ndrug counts involving a different controlled substance from other drug counts because of “the\npotential for jury confusion, or improper propensity inferences, with respect to the drug-related\naspects of the original charges”).\n\nFurthermore, the government’s decision to allege violations only in the narrou l994-\nl997 time period was deliberate—it did so, in part, to try to avoid the impact of Epstein’s 2oo7\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”). In its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s initial bail\napplication, the government argued that the NPA did not protect Ms. Maxwell from prosecution\nprincipally because the Indictment did not charge conduct covered by the NPA, which the\ngovernment argues “was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7, a time\nperiod that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 22 at 5-6).? The\ngovernment nou wants it both ways. It has confined the allegations in the Indictment to the\nearlier time frame to try to prevent a legal challenge that would result in the dismissal of the\nMann Act Counts, but at the same time it seeks to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> conduct from the later time period\nby joining the Perjury Counts. The government should not be permited to do so.\n\nIn addition, joinder of the Perjury Counts would prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it could\nimpact the ability of Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice to participate in the criminal trial. The\nPerjury Counts will involve complicated legal issues about permissible deposition questions,\nwhether the answers to the poorly formulated questions would have been alloued, the role of a\n\n? The defense disputes that the coverage of the NPA is so limited.

By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l6\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nStrike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring to cause individuals to travel in\ninterstate or foreign commerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the indictment contains no\nallegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled.’ Moreover, throughout the period alleged in the\nindictment, Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged conduct\nas to her took place. Therefore, the Court should strike all allegations regarding Accuser-3 from\nthe indictment, as they are nothing more than a transparent atempt by the government to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> Accuser-3’s testimony as evidence of a conspiracy, when it is at most “other acts”\nevidence subject to the balancing test required by Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nCounts One through Four of the indictment allege that between l994 and l997, Ms.\nMaxwell violated and conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act: l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 (nou § 2422(a)), which prohibits the enticement of individuals to travel in interstate or\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity, and l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2423(a), which prohibits the transportation of individuals under age l8 in interstate or foreign\ncommerce with the intent that they engage in unlawful sexual activity. The substantive Mann\nAct counts involve Ms. Maxwell’s alleged enticement and/or transportation of Accuser-l.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell engaged in group sexual encounters with\nJeffrey Epstein and Accuser-l and that, on at least one occasion, Ms. Maxwell enticed or caused\nAccuser-l to travel from Florida to New York for the purpose of engaging in such encounters\nwith Epstein. But to do so, it must rely on the accusations of a single individual regarding\n' This individual is described in the indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the individuals identified\nin the indictment as Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-l and Accuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo268o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l6\n§ 2422(a) and § 2423(a) conspiracies to cause individuals to travel in interstate or foreign\ncommerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity. /d. 99 lld, l7d.\nARGUMENT\nI. All References to Accuser-3 Should Be Stricken as Surplusage.\n\nUnder Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may strike\nsurplusage from the indictment or information.” “This rule introduces a means of protecting the\ndefendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which\nmay, houever, be prejudicial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) motions may be granted “where the challenged allegations\nare not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotations omited); see United States v.\nGreebel, No. l5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2684\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l6\nI. In the Alternative, the Government Should Be Required to Demonstrate the\n\nAdmissibility of Evidence Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nAt a minimum, the government should not be permited to use the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 to perform an end-run around Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). Rather, the government should be\nrequired to demonstrate the admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) of any evidence regarding\nAccuser-3.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) “governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or subsequent ‘bad\nacts’—evidence of ‘crimes, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United\nStates v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).\n\nAs shoun above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is irrelevant to the conspiracy counts.\nThus, to the extent that the government intends to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence regarding Accuser-3, such\nevidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed.

The\nGovernment respectfully submits this leter (l) to identify the differences between the charges\ncontained in the S2 Indictment and the charges contained in the prior indictment, Sl 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJIN) (the “Sl Indictment’); (2) to address the impact, if any, of the S2 Indictment on the status\nof discovery and other disclosures; and (3) to address the impact of the S2 Indictment on the\ncurrently pending motions.\n\n' The Government noted in its February 26, 2o2l Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition\nto the Defendant’s Pretrial Motions that its investigation remained ongoing and that the\nGovernment would seek a superseding indictment no later than three months prior to trial. At this\njuncture, while the Government’s investigation is still ongoing, if trial remains set for July l2,\n2o2l as scheduled, then the Government does not intend to seek any further indictments in this\ncase. To the extent the Government uncovers additional evidence that it may seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at\ntrial, it will promptly disclose such evidence to the defense as either Rule l6 or Jencks Act material.\nAdditionally, the Government remains cognizant that its Brady obligations remain ongoing and\nwill promptly disclose any exculpatory evidence of which it becomes aware.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002898.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\nIl. Any Records Obtained Pursuant to a Rule l7(c) Subpoena Should Be Marked\nConfidential Under the Protective Order and Produced to the Opposing Party\n\nAdditionally, and to the extent the defendant has issued or will issue other subpoenas ex\nparte pursuant to Rule l7(c), the responsive records should be produced to the Government and\nmarked confidential pursuant to the protective order.

Nouhere\ndoes the Rule provide for one party’s ability to use a subpoena to secretively gather material in\nadvance of trial, nor does it include a categorical exception due to concerns about defense or trial\nstrategy. Indeed, because the purpose of Rule l7 is to obtain evidence for use at trial, and not to\ninvestigate for evidence or obtain impeachment material, disclosure of the fruits of a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena fits neatly with Rule l6’s reciprocal obligations for disclosure of evidence that the\ndefendant intends to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> in her case-in-chief.

The\npreceding questions focused on (l) whether the defendant brought underage masseuses to work\nfor Epstein, and (2) whether Epstein had a sexual preference for underage girls.

The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y.

(Def. Mot. lo at l3-\nl4). In making this motion, the defense cites authority confirming that co-conspirator statements\nmay be admited at trial on a conditional basis without the need for any pretrial consideration of\ntheir admissibility. See United States v.

Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969))). Indeed, the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003565.jpg": "Case TAGeveOssechHAtP DmmunenitPerirs Rise Papaya Ofetest\nPage l7\nl G Maxwell - Confidential\n2 A.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case.

Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 (2d\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture.

Although investigation will vary depending on the\n\ncircumstances, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,\n\nafter consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of\n\nthe criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the\n\npossession of the prosecution, law enforcement authorities, and others, as well as\n\nindependent investigation.

And, again, the images\ncontain metadata that defense counsel must forensically analyze. Because defense counsel do not\neven have all of the images, this investigation cannot be accomplished in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial.\n\nF. The new charges and discovery require the assistance of defense experts\n\nIn addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of\npotential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized\nknouledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is nou potentially relevant due to the\nexpanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential\nhard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual\nfile creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government\nhas not identified any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic\nexaminers may be necessary to analyze the exhibits.\n\nMs. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 2o,ooo pages of “new” material to\nprovide that information to potential defense experts for consideration. None of this can happen\nin time to make appropriate disclosures in advance of trial. See United States v. Santos, No. S 9l\nCR. 724 (CSH), l99l WL 248784 at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Evidence may, or may not, be necessary after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is reasonable and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\npossession of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a production schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute.

Nor can she make appropriate motions to preclude the\ngovernment’s use of this evidence, as it falls outside of the scope of the charged conspiracies.\nMoreover, the government continues to refuse to provide Ms. Maxwell the most basic piece of\ninformation she needs to prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo423l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 7 of l6\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses.

Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73).

No. 66 (S.D.N.Y. July lo, 2ol8) (35oo material one month before securities fraud trial). The\ndefense’s request for yet earlier disclosure is unfounded and reflects a significant—and\nunwarranted—departure from the practices in this District.\n\nConsistent with the Government’s previously stated position (Dkt. No. 2o4 at l92), it is\nentirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through\nJencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government only intends to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> co-conspirator statements either through the testimony of witnesses, which will be\npreviewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the\nGovernment has previously noted, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that non-exculpatory\nco-conspirator statements are discoverable by Rule l6 or by any other means other than the Jencks\nAct. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing\nDistrict Court’s order directing the Government “to produce all oral statements made by the\ndefendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a\ndefendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol). The cases cited by the defense all involved orders granting\nbills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They\ndid not involve orders directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the Government\nmay <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial. Indeed, the Government is unaware of any case in which such particularized\nnotice distinct from the production of Jencks Act and marked exhibits has been ordered, and the\ndefense cites none. This Court has already denied the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars\nfor Counts One through Four (see Dkt. No. 2o7 at l9), and the Government has separately\nsubmited its opposition to the defendant’s supplemental motion for a bill of particulars.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 7 ofl3\nPage 7\n\n“premature” because the defense had not yet decided whether to call the expert and explaining that\n“Tallouing [the] defendant to defer the provision of such discovery until a final determination\nregarding whether or not [to] put an expert witness on the stand would seem to frustrate” the goal\nof allouing the Government a fair opportunity to prepare). The Government further notes that the\ndefense’s proposed disclosure date would not provide sufficient time for the Government to locate\na rebutal expert if appropriate or to provide notice of that rebutal expert to the defense. Because\nexperts are typically not available on a mater of weeks’ notice, it cannot be the case that the\ndefense will wait to review Jencks Act materials before contacting and retaining experts; there is\nno basis for delaying disclosure of this information to the Government, particularly given the delay\nthis will cause to resolving any potential Daubert issues before trial.\n\nIn addition, the Government proposes that the defense provide a proposed witness list and\nwitness statements, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2, and disclosures pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) by November l, 2o2l, or 4\nweeks in advance of trial. This deadline will provide the defense with ample time to determine\nwhat, if any, defense witnesses may testify at trial. This deadline will also permit the Government\nadequate time to review these materials and raise any appropriate objections or motions in advance\nof trial.\n\nDefendant's Position\n\nMs. Maxwell respectfully proposes the follouing pretrial disclosure schedule:\n\ne May 24 — government discloses identities of alleged victims.\n\ne Sept. 27 (9 weeks before trial) — government discloses Jencks Act/35oo\nmaterial, Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and notice, the government’s\nwitness list, any co-conspirator statements it intends to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial, and\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page lo of l3\nPage lo\n\n(2 year conspiracy charged the follouing year); Jones (l year conspiracy charged the same\nyear); Lebedev (2 year conspiracy charged in the second year); Corley (2 year conspiracy\ncharged in January of the follouing year). None involved, as this one does, allegations of a\nlo-year conspiracy charged 25 years later. None involved accusers who were located in at\nleast one foreign country, possibly more, for whom investigation will have to occur during\nthe midst of pandemic. The cases do not involve the same \"length\" or complexity of this one.\nCo-Conspirator Identities and Statements\n\nRegarding co-conspirator identities and statements, the government backtracked on its\nprevious representations to counsel and the Court. Ms. Maxwell sought early disclosure of\nboth in her pretrial motions (Dkt. l48 at l3-l4), and the government promised it would give\n\"notice of any co-conspirator statements that the Government may seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> through\nwitness statements\" sufficiently in advance of trial to permit objections by the defense. (Dkt.\n2o4 at l92) The Court agreed. (Dkt. 2o7 at 3o-3l). During recent conferrals on the schedule,\nhouever, the government made clear its intent to imbed any co-conspirator statements in the\nbulk of its Jencks/35oo material rather than separately disclose either the identity of any\npurported unindicted co-conspirator or their anticipated testimony. The government also\nstated for the first time its intent to identify any unindicted co-conspirator documentary\nstatements (e.g., emails between Epstein and any number of thousands of persons) only when\nit produces its exhibit list, one week after the in limine filing deadline. Neither government\nproposal will allou Ms. Maxwell to raise appropriate objections to the materials sufficiently\nin advance of trial, nor promote briefing during the in imine motions.

Ms. Maxwell requests the same deadline.\nDefense Disclosures Pursuant to Rules l6 and 26.2 and Defense Witness List\nRegarding the defense Rule l6 disclosures and witness lists, Ms. Maxwell proposes to\n\nproduce those at the close of the government's case. As she explained in connection with Rule\n26.2 disclosures (Jt. Leter of May 3, 2o2l), gaining access to Ms. Maxwell’s witness list and\nexhibits prior to trial gives an advantage to the government to the detriment of the defense. A\nrecent decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is instructive. Finding that the state equivalent\nof Rule l6, like its federal counterpart, does not authorize pretrial disclosure of defendant's\nexhibits, the court also concluded that such disclosure \"arguably infringes on [the defendant's]\nconstitutional rights,\" by \"helping the prosecution meet its burden of proof,\" \"tip[s] his hand\nvis-a-vis his investigation and theory of defense,\" and \"in effect, forces [him] to share with\nthe prosecution his trial strategy — l.e., hou he plans to defend against the charges against\nhim.\" People v. Kilgore, 455 P.3d 746, 75l (Colo. 2o2o). \"Put differently, the [pretrial]\ndisclosure requirement rests on shaky constitutional ground because it improperly risks\nlessening the prosecution's burden of proof.\" /d. Ms. Maxwell asserts that any order\ncompelling pretrial disclosure of her witnesses or exhibits violates the due process clause of\nthe U.S. Constitution. When the defense determines that it will put forth a case-in-chief, it\nwill provide the name of witnesses and exhibits it intends to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nUnited States Atorney\n\nBy: ___s/\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe\n\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial.

There is accordingly no significant risk that the defense will\nbe surprised at trial by a profusion of co-conspirators and their statements, even if the Government\nidentifies statements for use at trial from additional co-conspirators.\n\nIn any event, there is no basis to require the Government to provide a bill of particulars\ncontaining an exhaustive list of unnamed co-conspirators. This Court has twice concluded that no\nbill of particulars is warranted because the defendant has adequate information to prepare for trial\nand avoid unfair surprise. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l9-2l; Dkt.

The S2 Indictment already contains “more details than those strictly required.” (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 2o (discussing the Sl Indictment)). The Government has provided the defendant with\nextensive discovery that she has largely had in her possession for months, and it will provide\ninvolved orders granting bills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all\nalleged coconspirators,” and the Government had separately opposed the defense supplemental\nmotion for a bill of particulars.

Applicable Law\n\nUnder Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement is not\nhearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross examination about the statement, the\nstatement is consistent with the declarant’s testimony, and the statement is offered either ‘“(i) to\nrebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying; or (il) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a\nwitness when atacked on another ground.” Notably, “the prior consistent statement need not be\nproffered through the testimony of the declarant but may be proffered through any witness who\nhas firsthand knouledge of the statement.” United States v. Caracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir.\n2olo) (affirming admission of prior consistent statements to rebut defense insinuation that\nwitness had testified from improper motive).\n\nPrior to 2ol4, a witness’s prior consistent statement was only permited to rebut a charge\nof recent fabrication that postdated the prior consistent statement. See Tome v. United States,\n5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995). Many courts, houever, including the Second Circuit, had developed\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 54\nSimilarly, the Sixth Circuit has found that a district court properly admited evidence of prior\nconsistent statements that “rebuted [the d]Jefendant’s atack on [the declarant’s] purportedly\nfaulty memory.” United States v. Cox, 87l F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir. 2ol7).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects the Minor Victims to testify at trial about their experiences with\nthe defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, including the sexual abuse to which they were subjected, in\nthe l99os and early 2ooos. To the extent the defendant challenges the credibility of the\ntestimony of the Minor Victims—whether in opening statements or on cross-examination—the\nGovernment intends to call a number of witnesses to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> certain of the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\nSee, e.g., Flores, 945 F.3d at 7o5-o6 (admiting prior consistent statement of witness after\ndefense’s opening statement called into question the witness’s credibility); United States v.\nBurrell, 43 F. App’x 4o3, 4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (allouing prior consistent statements of cooperating\nwitness because the defendant “argued in her opening statement that the cooperating witnesses\nhad a motive to lie”).\n\nSuch testimony is admissible under both subparts (i) and (i) of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B). As to\nsubpart (i), if the defendant claims that a Minor Victim recently fabricated her testimony, the\nadmissibility of her prior consistent statements will depend in part on the alleged “recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying.” Because the Minor Victims’ prior consistent\nstatements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein were made well\nover a decade ago, they are almost certain to qualify as having been made prior to any accusation\nof motive to fabricate. They therefore tend to rebut any assertion that the victims or witnesses\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 54\ninvestigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2ol9 indictment against Epstein\nand a 2o2o indictment against the defendant.\n\nThe defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging\ndecisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 45 of 54\ntestimony by a case agent, is inadmissible hearsay. While the defendant has no burden to put on\na defense case, she can only <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> this evidence by doing so.\n\nAccordingly, before the defendant—in opening or during trial—argues or offers evidence\nabout the defendant’s absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the\nGovernment’s case-in-chief, the Court should require the defendant to explain the evidence she\nplans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.\n\nVIII. The Court Should Not Permit the Defendant to <span class=\"highlight\">Introduce</span> Her Own Prior\nStatements\n\nThe Government has produced to the defendant many of her oun statements, including\nprimarily (l) statements contained in emails or other communications, and (2) statements from\nher oun deposition. Some of the later statements contain denials of portions of the offense\nconduct, for which the defendant is separately charged with perjury. (See Indictment [fj] 28-3l).\nThe Court should not permit the defense to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> these statements.\n\nA defendant may not offer her oun statement into evidence without subjecting herself to\ncross-examination. “When the defendant seeks to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> his oun prior statement for the truth\nof the mater asserted, it is hearsay, and it is not admissible.” United States v. Marin, 669 F.2d\n73, 84 (2d Cir. l982); see also, e.g., United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d l2o6, l225 (2d Cir. l992)\n(similar); United States v. Fernandez, 839 F.2d 639, 64o (9th Cir. l987) (per curiam)\n(“[D]efense counsel wished to place [the defendant’s] statement . . . before the jury without\nsubjecting [the defendant] to cross-examination, precisely what the hearsay rule forbids.”);\nUnited States v. Torres, 435 F.

The Government is\nable to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v. Johnson, 5o7 F.3d 793, 796 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 54\nUnited States v. Castro, 8l3 F.2d 57l, 575-76 (2d Cir. l987)). But this doctrine “has never\nrequired the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to\nthe admited passages.” United States v. Williams, 93o F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omited); see id. at 6l (“[T]he rule of completeness does not\nrequire the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all circumstances.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony. To the extent the defendant wishes\nto offer her oun out-of-court statements, they are hearsay, whether in emails, deposition\ntranscripts, or elsewhere. And unless they accomplish the narrou function of the rule of\ncompleteness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such\nstatements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the\ndefense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each\ntrial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be\naddressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such\nstatements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2\ndisclosures.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo544o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations.

In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested disclosure of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against disclosure\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd.

R. Evid. 4o4(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended in December\n2o2o, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered,\nan articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that\npurpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3). In December 2o2o, the Rule was “amended principally to\nimpose additional notice requirements in a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4, Advisory\nCommitee Notes, 2o2o Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc.

Al-Sadawi,\n432 F.3d 4l9 (2d Cir. 2oo5) and Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3, to exclude evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell’s supposed “flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the\ngovernment from arguing to the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law\nenforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of, her arrest, or that her conduct during this time\nperiod is proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from\npublic view after Epstein’s arrest was emphatically not for the purpose of evading detection by\nlaw enforcement, but instead was an effort to protect herself and her family members from an\nonslaught of intrusive media atention and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless harassment from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\nconsciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\nunsupported inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl4\nFlight is, at most, circumstantial evidence of guilt and its probative value “depends upon\nthe degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s\nbehavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to\nconsciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt\n\nconcerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.” Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424\n\n(quoting Myers, 55o F.2d at lo49). “Because of the inherent unreliability of evidence of flight,\n\nand the danger of prejudice its use may entail, a flight instruction is improper unless the evidence\n\nis sufficient to furnish reasonable support for all four of the necessary inferences.” Myers, 55o\n\nF.2d at lo5o (internal citations omited). An adequate evidentiary predicate “must include some\n\nevidence surrounding the failure to appear ... and must thereby provide the jury with more than\n\nan opportunity for mere conjecture and speculation.” United States v. Sanchez, 79o F.2d 245,\n\n252 (2d Cir. l986) (internal quotations and citations omited) (emphasis in original).\n\nIl. The Government Should Not Be Permited to <span class=\"highlight\">Introduce</span> Evidence of Alleged\n“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After Epstein’s Death Is Proof of\nConsciousness of Guilt\nThe government cannot establish a satisfactory factual predicate for the jury to infer that\n\nMs. Maxwell was, in fact, fleeing or evading law enforcement authorities after the arrest of\n\nJeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct is proof of consciousness of guilt. The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys. As previously discussed,\n\nMs. Maxwell also addressed and rebuted each point that the government referenced in its bail\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5696\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl4\nsubmissions as evidence of flight. Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited.

Ms. Maxwell also\nrespectfully moves the Court to redact from the superseding indictment the perjury counts and\nany allegations that Ms. Maxwell made false statements to “conceal” her involvement in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s crimes. Ms. Maxwell requests this relief pursuant to the Court’s prior severance ruling\nand Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3. See 4/l6/2o2l Op. and Order (Dkt. 2o7) at 23-26; Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Court has already ruled that the perjury counts must be severed because trying the\n\nperjury counts with the other counts in the indictment would risk admiting evidence that would\nbe “unduly prejudicial” to Ms. Maxwell, would “compromise [Ms.] Maxwell’s right to the\ncounsel of her choice,” and would “risk an unfair trial.” 4/l6/2o2l Op. and Order (Dkt. 2o7) at\n23-24. In particular, the Court recognized that introducing evidence related to the perjury\ncharges would expose the jury to other acts of alleged sexual abuse that are not charged in the\nindictment, as well as evidence of an unrelated civil lawsuit by a separate accuser, that could\nsignificantly sway the jury’s verdict on the other counts in the indictment.\n\n[Trying the perjury counts with the other counts] would <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>\n\nunrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially\n\nexpose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.\n\nIn particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a\n\nwider swath of information regarding civil litigation against\n\nEpstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This\n\npresents a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence\n\nof the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered\n\nseparately, it would not do so.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 Filed lo/29/2l Page5oflil\nId. at 24 (citing United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). The Court did not\nbelieve that a limiting instruction would be adequate to mitigate the risk of prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell. /d.\n\nThe Court further found that any consideration of the perjury charges would likely\nrequire disqualification of at least one of her atorneys in the criminal case, two of whom had\nrepresented her at the civil depositions, which would significantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of\n\nat least one of Maxwell’s atorneys from participating as an\n\nadvocate on her behalf..... Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action\n\nand the deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury\n\ncounts. Even if counsel were not required to testify, trying all\n\ncounts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her\n\ncounsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having\n\nthem assist her in defending the Mann Act charges....\n\nDisqualification of counsel also implicates Maxwell’s Sixth\n\nAmendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice.\n\nThe prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the\n\natorneys who represented her in the civil case have worked with\n\nher for years and are particularly familiar with the facts\n\nsurrounding the criminal prosecution.\nId. at 24-25 (internal citations omited). Finally, the Court noted that much of the proof relevant\nto the perjury counts was beyond the scope of the “narrouer issues” presented by the other\ncharges, that the perjury counts involved legal and factual questions were “unlikely to bear on\nthe other charges,” and that addressing the perjury counts would involve a “significant\ninvestment of time and resources” that would impair the efficiency of the trial. /d. at 25-26. For\nthese reasons, the Court found that Ms. Maxwell had shoun “significant unfairness” that\noutweighed the burden of conducting separate trials and severed the perjury counts. /d. at 23, 26.\n\nAccordingly, the government will not be alloued to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial evidence of any\nalleged false deposition statements by Ms. Maxwell as evidence of the perjury counts.

See S2 Superseding Indictment\n(Dkt. l87) JJ 2 (second sentence), lo. For these same reasons discussed in the Court’s severance\nruling, and for the reasons set forth belou, the government should not be alloued to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at\ntrial the deposition statements or any evidence related to the severed perjury counts for this\npurpose or for any other purpose. Furthermore, the Court should redact from the superseding\nindictment the two perjury counts and the allegations concerning Ms. Maxwell’s alleged effort to\n“conceal” her conduct. See id. | 2 (second sentence), lo, 28-3l.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Court Should Exclude Evidence Related to the Perjury Counts and Redact\n\nThose Allegations from the Superseding Indictment\n\nConsistent with its prior ruling, the Court should exclude any evidence related to the\nsevered perjury counts to prove a purported atempt by Ms. Maxwell to “conceal” her\ninvolvement in the other offenses charged in the superseding indictment. First, the alleged false\ndeposition statements would have no probative value as evidence of concealment unless the\ngovernment could establish that the statements were, in fact, false — an allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell vigorously disputes. As the Court noted in its severance opinion, the issue of whether\nthe deposition statements were false or truthful, as Ms. Maxwell maintains, is “a critical element\nof the perjury counts” that would need to be resolved by the jury. 4/l6/2o2l Op. and Order (Dkt.\n2o7) at 24. The government therefore could not <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> Ms. Maxwell’s deposition statements\nas evidence of concealment without litigating the core factual and legal issues at the heart of the\nperjury counts. Allouing the government to do so would entirely defeat the purpose of severing\nthe perjury counts in the first place.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page7ofil\n\nSecond, any evidence of alleged false statements, whether it is introduced as direct\nevidence of the perjury counts or as evidence of a purported effort to “conceal” the other crimes\ncharged in the superseding indictment, would substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell and would\njeopardize her right to a fair trial for the same reasons the Court identified in its severance ruling.\nAllouing the jury to consider evidence related to the perjury counts “would <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> unrelated\nallegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the jury to evidence that might\notherwise not be admissible . . . [and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation\nagainst Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24. This would present\n“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd. Further, allouing the introduction\nof this evidence would “likely to require disqualification of at least one of Maxwell’s atorneys\nfrom participating as an advocate on her behalf,” which would “implicate[] [Ms.] Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice” and would significantly\nprejudice her right to a fair trial. /d. at 24-25. Introducing evidence related to the perjury counts\nas evidence of alleged concealment, or for any purpose, would present these same problems and\nshould not be alloued.\n\nThird, as the Court recognized in its prior ruling, fully litigating the perjury charges—\nwhich would be necessary if the government were alloued to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the allegedly false\ndeposition statements to shou concealment—would result in a distracting and time-intensive\nside-shou at trial that will confuse the jury with legal and factual issues that are far afield from\nthe “narrouer issues” that pertain to the other charged offenses. /d. at 25-26. This would\nfrustrate the goal of a fair and efficient trial on the remaining charges. /d. at 26. For the same\nreasons, whatever probative value (if any) this evidence may have related to the other charged\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo57o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page8oflil\noffenses is significantly outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, juror confusion, and undue\ndelay and should be excluded. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nSeparate and apart from the Court’s prior ruling, the government has not established a\nsufficient connection between the alleged false statements and the alleged sex abuse offenses to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the statements as evidence of concealment of the later. The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\nintroduced as proof of concealment of those offenses. See United States v. Marcus Schloss &\nCo., Inc., 7lo F. Supp. 944, 946-5o (S.D.N.Y. l989) (precluding evidence of defendants’ alleged\natempts to obstruct SEC investigation as proof of the underlying insider trading conspiracy\nwhen conspiracy was already over and there was no evidence of an “express original agreement”\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of8\n\nThe Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial. It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial.

In addition to problems related to the evidentiary foundation of these items,\nthey are not relevant to any issue in this case. The unopened boxes were purportedly seized in\n2oo5, after the end of any conspiracy alleged here.

The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v.

There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA.

R. Evid. 8ol).\nAccordingly, the Government argued that “the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator\nstatements that the Government may seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> through witness statements” in its Jencks\nAct production. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4).\n\nThe Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the pouer to order pretrial\ndisclosure of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7). The\nCourt also explained that the “[c]o-conspirator statements may often be admited at trial on a\nconditional basis,” and to the extent that “can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary\nhere because the Government has commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six\nweeks in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.” (/d. at 3o-3l).\n\nThe defendant’s second bite at the apple came in the parties’ joint scheduling leter. (Leter,\nDkt. No. 29l). There, the defense requested that the Government “identify any co-conspirator’s\nnames and statements (whether via witness testimony or documentary evidence) at the same time\nas it discloses []35oo material,” so it could “litigate their admissibility before trial.” (/d. at ll-l2).\nThe Government responded that it is “entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of\nany co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits,” because any co-\nconspirator statements will be contained therein. (/d. at 5). The Government also noted that the\ndefendant cited no cases “directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the\nGovernment may <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial.” (/d.)\n\nOn June 2, 2o2l, the Court adopted the “Government’s proposal” and set a deadline of\nOctober ll, 2o2l, for the “disclosure of Jencks Act and Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 43\n\n958 N.

Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited.

Hou\nare the process and frequency of massages or the sexual nature of massages after the period of\nthe conspiracy proof of a plan or preparation, apart from the propensity inference? A plan or\npreparation usually comes before an event. Planning or preparing for something after it has\noccurred can only be based on an assumption that because you are the kind of person who\nsolicits underage massages later, you must have been the kind of person to do so earlier.\nSimilarly, knouledge after the end of the conspiracy is not the same as knouledge at the time of\nor before the purported charged acts occurred, except by way of propensity. Finally, unspecified\nexhibits, many of which appear to have been writen after the conspiracy (e.g., GX 5o5 — dated\nFeb. l4, 2oo5) cannot likewise be proof of the charged crimes which were allegedly completed\nbefore J shoued up.\n\nBecause the government makes no effort to argue the non-propensity purpose for these\nuses Of J Via Rule 4o4(b), and failed to give notice of the purposes or reason in\nadvance in any event, this Court should exclude the evidence on this ground.\n\n3. ee ©onstitutes an impermissible\nconstructive amendment and variance to the Indictment.\n\nFinally, what is clear from the government's proffer in their Response, the anticipated\ntestimony © fll\nRen.

Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l296\n(2d Cir. l99l) (“The weighing of relevance under Rule 4o3 may be altered when a false impression\nis created by earlier testimony.

The Minor Victims’ Prior Consistent Statements Are Admissible for Their\nTruth If the Defense Challenges Their Credibility\n\nIf the defendant claims that the Minor Victims’ testimony has been recently fabricated or\nthat the Minor Victims have motives to lie, or if the defense otherwise atacks the credibility of\nthe Minor Victims on another ground, the Government will seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement is not\nhearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross examination about the statement, the\nstatement is consistent with the declarant’s testimony, and the statement is offered either ‘“(i) to\nrebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying; or (il) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a\nwitness when atacked on another ground.” Notably, “the prior consistent statement need not be\nproffered through the testimony of the declarant but may be proffered through any witness who\nhas firsthand knouledge of the statement.” United States v. Caracappa, 6l4 F.3d 3o, 39 (2d Cir.\n2olo) (affirming admission of prior consistent statements to rebut defense insinuation that\nwitness had testified from improper motive).\n\nPrior to 2ol4, a witness’s prior consistent statement was only permited to rebut a charge\nof recent fabrication that postdated the prior consistent statement. See Tome v. United States,\n5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995). Many courts, houever, including the Second Circuit, had developed\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 54\nSimilarly, the Sixth Circuit has found that a district court properly admited evidence of prior\nconsistent statements that “rebuted [the d]Jefendant’s atack on [the declarant’s] purportedly\nfaulty memory.” United States v. Cox, 87l F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir. 2ol7).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects the Minor Victims to testify at trial about their experiences with\nthe defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, including the sexual abuse to which they were subjected, in\nthe l99os and early 2ooos. To the extent the defendant challenges the credibility of the\ntestimony of the Minor Victims—whether in opening statements or on cross-examination—the\nGovernment intends to call a number of witnesses to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> certain of the Minor Victims’\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.\nSee, e.g., Flores, 945 F.3d at 7o5-o6 (admiting prior consistent statement of witness after\ndefense’s opening statement called into question the witness’s credibility); United States v.\nBurrell, 43 F. App’x 4o3, 4o6 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (allouing prior consistent statements of cooperating\nwitness because the defendant “argued in her opening statement that the cooperating witnesses\nhad a motive to lie”).\n\nSuch testimony is admissible under both subparts (i) and (i) of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B). As to\nsubpart (i), if the defendant claims that a Minor Victim recently fabricated her testimony, the\nadmissibility of her prior consistent statements will depend in part on the alleged “recent\nimproper influence or motive in so testifying.” Because the Minor Victims’ prior consistent\nstatements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein were made well\nover a decade ago, they are almost certain to qualify as having been made prior to any accusation\nof motive to fabricate. They therefore tend to rebut any assertion that the victims or witnesses\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo638o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 54\ninvestigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2ol9 indictment against Epstein\nand a 2o2o indictment against the defendant.\n\nThe defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging\ndecisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 45 of54\ntestimony by a case agent, is inadmissible hearsay. While the defendant has no burden to put on\na defense case, she can only <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> this evidence by doing so.\n\nAccordingly, before the defendant—in opening or during trial—argues or offers evidence\nabout the defendant’s absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the\nGovernment’s case-in-chief, the Court should require the defendant to explain the evidence she\nplans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.\n\nVIII. The Court Should Not Permit the Defendant to <span class=\"highlight\">Introduce</span> Her Own Prior\nStatements\n\nThe Government has produced to the defendant many of her oun statements, including\nprimarily (l) statements contained in emails or other communications, and (2) statements from\nher oun deposition. Some of the later statements contain denials of portions of the offense\nconduct, for which the defendant is separately charged with perjury. (See Indictment [fj] 28-3l).\nThe Court should not permit the defense to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> these statements.\n\nA defendant may not offer her oun statement into evidence without subjecting herself to\ncross-examination. “When the defendant seeks to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> his oun prior statement for the truth\nof the mater asserted, it is hearsay, and it is not admissible.” United States v. Marin, 669 F.2d\n73, 84 (2d Cir. l982); see also, e.g., United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d l2o6, l225 (2d Cir. l992)\n(similar); United States v. Fernandez, 839 F.2d 639, 64o (9th Cir. l987) (per curiam)\n(“[D]efense counsel wished to place [the defendant’s] statement . . . before the jury without\nsubjecting [the defendant] to cross-examination, precisely what the hearsay rule forbids.”);\nUnited States v. Torres, 435 F. Supp. 3d 526, 538 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“Finally, the Court agrees\nwith the Government that, in the event evidence of his flight is admited, Torres may not\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 54\nautomatically admit his alternative explanation for his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in his\nout-of-court statements to others on social media or to prison officials.”). The Government is\nable to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v. Johnson, 5o7 F.3d 793, 796 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 54\nUnited States v. Castro, 8l3 F.2d 57l, 575-76 (2d Cir. l987)). But this doctrine “has never\nrequired the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to\nthe admited passages.” United States v. Williams, 93o F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omited); see id. at 6l (“[T]he rule of completeness does not\nrequire the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all circumstances.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a\ndefendant could not <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]\nrobbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the\nrobbery.” Johnson, 5o7 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s writen statements contained\nin her emails and oral statements through witness testimony. To the extent the defendant wishes\nto offer her oun out-of-court statements, they are hearsay, whether in emails, deposition\ntranscripts, or elsewhere. And unless they accomplish the narrou function of the rule of\ncompleteness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such\nstatements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the\ndefense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each\ntrial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be\naddressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such\nstatements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2\ndisclosures.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 54\ninto thinking that victimization was in some way relevant to its evaluation of the defendant’s\nmens rea,\n\nBecause the Government is aware of no evidence that the defendant was a victim of\nEpstein, and because any such evidence may well be irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial in any\nevent, the Court should preclude the defense from discussing it at trial absent a specific offer of\nproof in advance as to the nature and relevance of such evidence. !\n\nXI. The Defendant Should Be Precluded from Arguing That She Was A “Prevailing\nParty” in Civil Litigation\n\nThe Court should preclude the defense from inaccurately suggesting to the jury that the\ndefendant prevailed in civil litigation related to some of the events at issue at trial.\n\nBy way of background, Minor Victim-2 filed a civil action in this District, bringing\nclaims against the defendant and the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. No |§=—— |\nFo Minor Victim-2 received a substantial setlement from the estate after\nparticipating in a compensation program for victims of Jeffrey Epstein. As part of that\nsetlement, Minor Victim-2 moved to dismiss her civil action in its entirety. The defendant—\nwho was represented in that lawsuit by atorneys who represent her in this criminal case—asked\n'° The Government is not moving specifically to preclude a defense or evidence based on Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l2.2 because the defense has represented that it is not planning to\noffer such a defense or evidence. Specifically, if a defendant intends to (l) assert an insanity\ndefense, or (2) <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> “expert evidence relating to a mental disease or defect or any other\nmental condition of the defendant bearing on . . . the issue of guilt,” the defendant must provide\nwriten notice to the Government “within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or at any\nlater time the court sets.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l2.2(a)-(b). The defense has not provided such\nnotice, and has informed the Government that they do not intend to rely on any defense covered\nby the Rule. Accordingly, the Government understands that the defense has waived any Rule\nl2.2 defense.\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive rehabilitation. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for rehabilitation remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo645o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 69\nwhom the government identified as a victim of his offenses so that they could sue him for\ndamages in civil lawsuits. See NPA at 4 was one of those individuals. The\nNPA further stipulated that Epstein could not contest his liability in those lawsuits and could not\ncontest the amount of money damages as long as it was agreed upon by the parties. See id yy\n\n| Epstein under this provision of the NPA and eventually setled with him for\nDn \\ccordingly, the NPA is relevant and\nadmissible, and the defense is entitled to use it to cross-examin PE bout her\nfinancial interest. See United States v. Lester, 248 F.2d 329, 334 (2d Cir. l957) (“it is\npermissible to shou [on cross-examination] that the witness is financially interested in the\noutcome of the litigation); Croue v. Bolduc, 334 F.3d l24, l32 (lst Cir. 2oo3) (evidence that a\ntrial witness has a financial incentive in the outcome of the trial is “classic evidence of bias,\nwhich is routinely permited on cross-examination’’); United States v.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point.

In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested disclosure of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against disclosure\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the government identified three purported co-conspirators for\npurposes of trial: Jeffrey Epstein, [x | Thc\ngovernment, houever, failed and refused to disclose “a// (or any) co-conspirator statements it\nintends to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial....” Instead, the government, circumventing the plain meaning of the\nCourt’s Order, offered that “[t]he Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo656o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4ofl2\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves in limine to exclude any evidence the Government seeks to\nadmit at trial under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended in December\n2o2o, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered,\nan articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that\npurpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3). In December 2o2o, the Rule was “amended principally to\nimpose additional notice requirements in a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4, Advisory\nCommitee Notes, 2o2o Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\nanticipated evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc.

Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\ndetermination of what evidence it will seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial pursuant to\" the Rule.

It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial.

The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v.

There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA.

R. Evid. 8ol).\nAccordingly, the Government argued that “the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator\nstatements that the Government may seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> through witness statements” in its Jencks\nAct production. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4).\n\nThe Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the pouer to order pretrial\ndisclosure of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7). The\nCourt also explained that the “[c]o-conspirator statements may often be admited at trial on a\nconditional basis,” and to the extent that “can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary\nhere because the Government has commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six\nweeks in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.” (/d. at 3o-3l).\n\nThe defendant’s second bite at the apple came in the parties’ joint scheduling leter. (Leter,\nDkt. No. 29l). There, the defense requested that the Government “identify any co-conspirator’s\nnames and statements (whether via witness testimony or documentary evidence) at the same time\nas it discloses []35oo material,” so it could “litigate their admissibility before trial.” (/d. at ll-l2).\nThe Government responded that it is “entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of\nany co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits,” because any co-\nconspirator statements will be contained therein. (/d. at 5). The Government also noted that the\ndefendant cited no cases “directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the\nGovernment may <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial.” (/d.)\n\nOn June 2, 2o2l, the Court adopted the “Government’s proposal” and set a deadline of\nOctober ll, 2o2l, for the “disclosure of Jencks Act and Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6765\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 43\n\n958 N.

Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited.

There Should Be a Sanction\n\nHedging its bets, the government acknouledges that it “may have misread the court’s\norder” but offers no solution other than the defense is “‘free to litigate the admissibility of any\nsuch statement during trial.” This was the government’s losing argument before the Order.\n\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to sanction a party who violates discovery orders.\nUnited States v. Golyansky, 29l F.3d l245, l249 (loth Cir. 2oo2). In considering a particular\nremedy for a violation, the factors considered are “the reasons why disclosure was not made, the\nextent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by\na continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59\n(2d Cir. 2ol6) (quoting United States v. Pineros, 532 F.2d 868, 87l (2d Cir. l976)). The\nappropriate remedy is exclusion. Ms. Maxwell has been in jail for approximately l8 months. She\nis trying not to request a continuance of the trial and her lawyers are making every effort to\nreview massive amounts of discovery, interview potential witness, prepare for trial, and juggle a\nmyriad of other responsibilities. The government offers no legitimate excuse for non-\ncompliance. It clearly knous what statements it will try to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>, it just does not want to tell\nanyone to avoid challenges to the statements. This is willful, not negligent or inadvertent conduct\nwhich should not be sanctioned by the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo689o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel9of52\n2.

A plan or\npreparation usually comes before an event. Planning or preparing for something after it has\noccurred can only be based on an assumption that because you are the kind of person who\nsolicits underage massages later, you must have been the kind of person to do so earlier.\nSimilarly, knouledge after the end of the conspiracy is not the same as knouledge at the time of\nor before the purported charged acts occurred, except by way of propensity. Finally, unspecified\nexhibits, many of which appear to have been writen after the conspiracy (e.g., GX 5o5 — dated\nFeb. l4, 2oo5) cannot likewise be proof of the charged crimes which were allegedly completed\nbefore J shoued up.\n\nBecause the government makes no effort to argue the non-propensity purpose for these\nuses Of J Via Rule 4o4(b), and failed to give notice of the purposes or reason in\nadvance in any event, this Court should exclude the evidence on this ground.\n\n3.

Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar circumstances, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s possession.

By its oun admission, the government wants to use Accuser-3’s testimony to prove this\naspect of Epstein’s character and argue that he acted in accordance with this character with the\nother Accusers.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the question whether the\ndefense is required to disclose exhibits they intend to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> into evidence through Government\nwitnesses as “impeachment.” While the defendant need not disclose exhibits being introduced\nsolely for impeachment, the defendant may not circumvent Rule l6’s disclosure requirements by\ndescribing defense exhibits as being used for impeachment when in fact they are properly\nconsidered part of the defendant’s case in chief. Further, the introduction of extrinsic evidence for\nthe purpose of impeachment is narrouly circumscribed, as set forth belou.\n\nRule l6(b) expressly requires disclosure of items the defense “intends to use . . . in the\ndefendant’s case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A). The defendant’s “case in chief”\nis not a formalist term for the events that begin the moment the Government rests. Rather, “where\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l7 Filed ll/3o/2l Page3of4\ngive rise to good cause for a belated disclosure.! Absent such a shouing, houever, new defense\nexhibits should be precluded or, at a minimum, ordered to be disclosed forthwith.\n\nTo the extent the defense anticipates offering exhibits for impeachment, as a general mater,\n“extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to\natack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o8(b). This rule is\nsubject to certain exceptions. For instance, as the parties agreed this afternoon, extrinsic evidence\nof a witness’s prior statement is not barred by Rule 6o8. Fed. R. Evid. 6l3. The Rules also permit\n“other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and\nmental capacity).” United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d l93, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 6o8(b) Advisory Commitee Notes). But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered\nfor impeachment on a collateral issue is properly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, l44 F.3d 24l,\n245-46 (2d Cir. l998); see United Sates v. Dore, No. l2 Cr. 45 (RJS), 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6\n(S.D.N.Y. July 3l, 2ol3) (Sullivan, J.) (“[T]he Second Circuit has held . . . that introduction of\nextrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent statement is only appropriate as it relates to maters which\nare not collateral, i.e., as to those maters which are relevant to the issues in the case and could be\nindependently proven.” (internal quotation marks omited)). Accordingly, the defense may offer\nextrinsic evidence for impeachment, if the defense articulates an appropriate exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on such evidence described above.\n\n‘To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final\ndetermination as to what evidence they intend to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>—a position that effectively renders\nRule l6 a nullity. See, e.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, No. $2 o9 Cr. ll84 (RJH), 2oll WL\n72353o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2oll) (“A defendant would always like more information about\nthe government’s case before revealing anything about his or her oun, but Rule l6 conditions a\ndefendant’s disclosure obligations on the government’s having made certain specified disclosures,\nnot on the government’s laying open its entire case or the defendant’s satisfaction.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “case-in-chief” does not\ninclude her cross-examination of a prosecution witness during the government’s “case-in-chief.”\n\nHere, Ms. Maxwell has not called her first witness. Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started. Because Ms. Maxwell has not begun her case-in-chief, she had no\nobligation under Rule l6(b)(l)(A) to disclose the photograph she offered in evidence while\ncross-examining Jane.\n\nThere is no doubt Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not apply to material a defendant offers into\nevidence while cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief. The l974\nCommitee Notes to Rule l6 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(l)(A) provides that the\ndefendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession,\ncustody, or control and which he intends to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> in evidence in his case in chief.” Fed.

Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v.

Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v.

This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness\nuses a writing to refresh memory:\n(l) while testifying; or\n(2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to\nhave those options.\n(b) Adverse Party's Options; Deleting Unrelated Mater. Unless l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to\nhave the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the\nwitness about it, and to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> in evidence any portion that relates to the\nwitness's testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes\nunrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\nAny portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.\n(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if\nthe prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the\nwitness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial.\nThe witness has admited using the journal to refresh her memory. Title l8 of U.S. Code\n§ 35oo is inapplicable here by its very terms because the remainder of the journal is, admitedly,\nnot in the possession of the government. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) (applies exclusively to\nstatements “in the possession of the United States”); see also United States v. Bin Laden, 397 F.\nSupp. 2d 465, 49l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5) (“The statute thus establishes three essential elements\nDOJ-OGR-oooll245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 6ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The indictment\nand the accusers are vague regarding when things happened, what things happened and who may\nhave been present when anything is alleged to have happened. Accuser-2’s journal contains\ndated entries that place events in context with other alleged events. Accuser-2’s journal from\nl996 purports to document encounters with Epstein in New York. The S2 indictment, paragraph\n9(b), claims that “Maxwell interacted with [Accuser-2] on at least one occasion in or about l996\nat Epstein’s residence in New Mexico....” The journal references other dates, places, and events\nin l996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell in context with other recorded events is\nboth relevant and exculpatory.\n\nAs a piece of physical evidence, the journal is subject to inspection and testing. See F. R.\nCrim. P. l7(c)(l). Moreover, were the journal in the possession of the government it would be\nsubject to inspection under F. R. Crim. P. l6 (a) (l) (E) which provides, in relevant part:\n\nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to\ninspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data,\nphotographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of\nany of these items, if the tem is within the government's possession,\ncustody, or control and:\n\n(i) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial[.]\n\nTo avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted partisan\nphotocopies of five substantive pages without questioning the provenance of an exhibit it intends\nto <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> at trial. Comparison of one of the five pages demonstrates the problem. Atached as\nexhibit A is a photocopy of a journal entry first produced during the civil litigation.

The government should be instructed that it cannot\ndiscuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.\n\nSimilarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-l to\n“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear\nto be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. United\nStates, 344 U.S. 6o4 (l953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 44o (l949). The government\nnou seems to concede this point, falling back on the time honored “effect on the listener” and\ntherefore not offered for the truth of the mater exception to the hearsay rule. The problem with\nthe government’s position, houever, is that the statement and subsequent actions are not relevant\nto any material issue in this case. The apparent point of the proffered evidence is to demonstrate\nthat, in 2oo5, Epstein was extracting his computers in advance of the search and thus may have\nhad some guilty knouledge. Ms. Maxwell is not charged with tampering or obstruction and\nEpstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-l to do something with his computers is not\nrelevant to whether Ms. Maxwell conspired to do the things alleged in the indictment. Again, any\nprobative value associated with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell who was not present, did not participate, and had no knouledge of either the statement\nor the acts.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 72o Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof3\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY loo22\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP +l2l2 957 76oo phone\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

The list of witnesses may be substantially reduced if the government is willing to agree\nto stipulations as to certain documents and witness testimony. We have conferred with\nthe government regarding these stipulations, but as yet the government has not agreed\nto them. Accordingly, the list includes several witnesses who will be called to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> certain documents or to testify about particular prior inconsistent statements.\n\n2o64893. l\nDOJ-OGR-oooll342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 36 of lo6 4o\nLBTCMAXK2 Opening - Ms. Pomerantz\n\nl Epstein's sexual abuse evolved over the course of a decade.\n\n2 You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of\n\n3 mentoring young girls, of promising them scholarships and\n\n4 opportunity, to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> massage, inviting them on trips and\n\na transporting them across state lines, and that you will learn\n\n6 that they used these so called massages as a way to sexually\n\n7 abuse the victims.\n\n8 During that earlier phase, the defendant and Epstein\n\n9 had to find each girl individually themselves, but by the early\nlo 2ooos, the defendant and Epstein found an easier way to\n\nll maintain a continuous flou of girls to abuse. They were no\n\nl2 longer finding girls through the cover of scholarships and\n\nl3 opportunity. Instead, they devised a pyramid scheme of abuse,\nl4 a scheme that no longer required the defendant to personally\n\nl5 find young girls for Epstein.\n\nl6 So what did the defendant and Epstein do? They\n\nl7 encouraged girls to bring other girls. They asked the girls if\nl8 they had any young friends to bring over. And when a girl\n\nl9 brought someone new, she was rewarded with cash, extra cash on\n2o top of the hundreds of dollars she got for giving Epstein a\n2l sexualized massage. The defendant and Epstein handed hundred\n22 dollar bills to poor teenage girls in exchange for them giving\n23 Epstein so called massages. To be clear, those girls were not\n24 professional masseuses — they were kids being sexually\n25 exploited and abused.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll7ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00011817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of 247 l73\nLBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct\n\nl passenger name, I wanted to put whether they were male or\n\n2 female, the passenger -- as a pilot's standpoint, it's more\n\n3 important hou many people and hou much they weigh compared to a\n4 person's name.

Which is, let's face it,\n22 usually what happens. There's often not a defense case.

EVERDELL: I think that's right, your Honor.\n\n6 Let's give an example, because I think it's helpful to\n7 use examples. I'll use one from this very case.\n\n8 It's my understanding that the government wants to\n\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> certain FedEx records through a FedEx document\n\nlo custodian. The defense also would like to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> other\n\nll FedEx records, coincidentally, through the same document\n\nl2 custodian. So if that happens, you'd have a witness called by\nl3 the government, the defense would want to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> affirmative\nl4 proof in its case through that same witness. That would be\n\nl5 defense case-in-chief material which, by the way, we disclosed\nl6 in our Rule l6 leter to the government. That's an example, I\nl7 think, where the courts are talking about where you disclose\n\nl8 things -- where you have a witness where you are trying to put\nl9 on affirmative proof in the defense case through the\n2o government's witness. That is an example where we don't\n2l dispute.\n22 T'll give another example. This is a hypothetical\n23 one. Larry Visoski just testified. He was shoun a number of\n24 pictures of Litle St. James Island where there were\n25 structures, houses on the island. And he testified to those,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2o26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012027.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 7 of 264 4l3\nLClVMAXl\n\nl and those were introduced.\n\n2 If we hypothetically had photos of that same island\n\n3 before those houses were built, we don't, but if we did and we\n\n4 wanted to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> those through Larry Visoski, again, that\n\n5 would be affirmative defense in the defense case-in-chief\n\n6 introduced through the government's witness. That would be\n\n7 Rule l6 which we'd have to disclose ahead of time.\n\n8 THE COURT: Right.\n\n9 MR.

So misremembering details,\n\nl3 misremembering where she lived, not being able to recognize a\nl4 house, that all goes to her credibility as a witness, her\nl5 believability, any contradiction.\nl6 This is central to the case.

That is, if she testifies to\nl9 something and we think we have something that contradicts what\n2o she just said, like a photograph of her -- of a place where she\n2l lived as a child, but she didn't seem to remember, that's\n22 impeachment material. And we don't knou if we're going to use\n23 that until she says on the stand what she says on the stand.\n24 We have it ready to go in case she says that, and she did in\n25 this case, and so that's why we were able to use it or try to\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2o27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012028.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 8 of 264 4l4\nLClVMAXl\n\nl use it, to shou that she doesn't have an accurate recollection.\n\n2 That is pure impeachment material.\n\n3 THE COURT: Up to the point where you said it\n\n4 contradicted what she said on the stand, you and I were in\n\n5 vigorous agreement.\n\n6 MR.

There are two photographs\nlo in there, and we did discuss these, so I wasn't -- did not get\nll a chance to preview this for the government yet, but there are\nl2 two photographs, I believe it's 9l9 and 92o, that shou the\n\nl3 outfits, the schoolgirl outfits.\n\nl4 Nou, the Court ruled before that those wouldn't be put\nl5 before the jury unless witness 3, or Kate, was able to link\n\nl6 them up. She did talk about wearing a schoolgirl outfit.\n\nl7 Houever, she was not shoun those photographs in her direct. So\nl8 I think we have a similar problem to what we had with Kate -—-\nl9 sorry. With Jane where she described a schoolgirl outfit, but\n2o she didn't look at the actual photos that they want to\nal <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> and say those look like the schoolgirl outfits I was\n22 wearing on the day I described.\n23 So, at this point, because I don't think there is a\n24 proper foundation for the same reasons as we had with Jane, I\n25 would object to those photos being admited.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool294l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 257 of 26l l4l8\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\n\nl And by the way, we were precluded from cross examination about\n2 her publicly available photographs of a similar type.\n\n3 THE COURT: I don't understand the parallel.

You knou that Jane traveled\n2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you\n\n3 also knou it because Alessi told you about that. And you knou\n4 it because the flight records shou it too.\n\n5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips.

That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight.

You knou that Jane traveled\n2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you\n\n3 also knou it because Alessi told you about that. And you knou\n4 it because the flight records shou it too.\n\n5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips.

That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight.

That's an example, I\nl7 think, where the courts are talking about where you disclose\n\nl8 things -- where you have a witness where you are trying to put\nl9 on affirmative proof in the defense case through the\n2o government's witness. That is an example where we don't\n2l dispute.\n22 T'll give another example. This is a hypothetical\n23 one. Larry Visoski just testified.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020196.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageblGhl2\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7.

The\nindictment further charges that ...”); pg. 25 (“The indictment makes plain\n.. It was an ongoing scheme ... Given the strength of the government’s\nevidence ... there is an incredibly strong incentive for the defendant to flee\n..). The court erred in agreeing that the Indictment itself demonstrates\nstrength. Id. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the\nevidence proffered by the government in assessing risk of flight. The\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.\nAlthough the charged conduct took place many years ago, the indictment\ndescribes ...”). At no point did the Government <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> or even proffer\nany actual evidence.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020783.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel65 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24 of 34\none.” United States v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a\nlawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a\nwitness. N.Y. R. Prof] Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the\ndeposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not\nrequired to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020785.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel67 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited.\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\n<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020995.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel69 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that massage\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls . .. to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “<span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span>” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021999.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 22 Filed ol/28/2o Page 2of3\nJanuary 28, 2o2o\nPage 2\nGovernment also produced 35oo material for every individual interviewed during the investigation\nin December, nearly four months in advance of trial.\n\n‘Whether or not to adjourn a trial date is traditionally within the discretion of the trial\njudge.” United States v.

Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to <span class=\"highlight\">introduce</span> into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022077.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l5 of 34\nB.
