The government does not explain why this witness is unavailable, and then they\n\nnote, in a footnote, that the witness actually would be available to testify touards the end of the\ngovernment’s case. In essence, that is less a “conflict” than a requirement that the government\n\nput on its case in a different order. It is also biterly ironic that the government had been pushing\n\nfor the earliest possible trial date to protect the victims’ interests, but nou seeks to postpone it to\n\nkeep the trial team together and to put its witnesses on in a preferred order.\n\nBy contrast, pushing the trial to the end of November will have a severe and irreparable\nimpact on Ms. Maxwell's defense. First, she will be detained longer. Second, the estimated four\nweeks for the government's case will result in Ms. Maxwell's defense being pressed to conclude\nbefore the holidays or worse, extending the case into the new year, which the Court already\nconcluded was unwarranted delay. While the government may complete its case-in-chief before\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christmas</span>, the defense will not. This will cast defense counsel and the defense case in a negative\nlight as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before <span class=\"highlight\">Christmas</span>, which it won’t. Third,\nstarting on the Monday after Thanksgiving will pose impediments to the potential jury pool —\nmany of whom will hopefully be able to travel to see family for the first time since before\nCOVID -- and will disrupt travel plans for counsel and our families. Fourth, Ms. Maxwell's\nwitnesses who will be traveling from various locations will be forced to book uncertain travel\nplans in the days leading up to — or after -- the holiday season.\n\nTo accommodate the government’s vaguely articulated scheduling issues, we informed\ngovernment counsel that we would consider starting on November l5, but no later.\n\nWe firmly request that the Court set the trial to start on November 8\" to ensure that the\ntrial will conclude before <span class=\"highlight\">Christmas</span>.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 337 Filed lo/o5/2l Pagelofl\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT = oo\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ibingusieiai cad |\n\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\n\nUnited States of America, DATE FILED: lo/5/2l __|\n\n—VvV—\n\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n\nGhislaine Maxwell,\n\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial.

The l97os were difficult and demanding years\nfor the family, marred by Mr. Maxwell’s endless batle of lawsuits and financial ruin.

Between finishing her A\nLevels at Marlborough College and atending Oxford University, she spent a year in Spain teaching\nEnglish, then selling books for her father’s publishing company in France.

The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\nhouse.

Several massage\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk.
