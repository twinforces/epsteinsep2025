Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000284.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page ll of l6\n\nOther than his 2oo8 guilty plea predicated on conduct substantially overlapping the same\nconduct charged here, Mr. Epstein has no criminal history.

During the years since his release from incarceration in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000323.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document8 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lof2\n.)

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district. See page 6, infra.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.\n36l at 3-4, 36l-7 through 36l-ll. In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an “offender,” the financier told The Post\nyesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.’”); Philip\nWeiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus story, someone who flies too\nclose to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000391.jpg": "Jase ba9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti8- Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 5 of l8 is)\n\nl MR.

The NPA provided\nl3 him with immunity for any offenses arising from a joint\n\nl4 FBI/grand jury/U.S. Atorney investigation that led to a\n\nl5 decision by Mr. Epstein to plead to a higher state offense than\nl6 the state prosecutors contemplated. He went to jail, signed an\nl7 agreement, and has lived up to its terms loo percent.\n\nl8 We have seen in the paperwork of the CVRA, in the\n\nl9 Southern District of Florida, in writing at docket 2o5-2 the\n2o government's motion to dismiss CVRA, urging that the witnesses\n2l there go to the Southern District of New York and essentially\n22 try to motivate them to prosecute for the very same conduct, in\n23 other words, the conduct that Mr. Epstein was immunized,\n24 including travel between two states, telephonic communications\n25 between two states.

In November 2ol8, media reports\nsuggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a “slap on\nthe wrist.” Puting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-\nprosecution agreement and the prison sentence Epstein completed,\nthere’s no denying that although certain witnesses through their\natorney representatives,!! the media — e.g., The Miami Herald — and the\npublic were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled\nextensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the\nUnited States.

The Government also contends that “[i]n light of the strength of the Government’s |\nevidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction [45 |\nyears], there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant :\nwealth, his ounership of and access to private planes capable of international travel, and his\nsignificant international ties.” Id.\nThe Government also provides the follouing background information: “In or about 2oo5,\nthe defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with :\nallegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The investigation\nultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\n| District of Florida and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews with victims based in the\nPalm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count One of the instant\nIndictment. In the fall of 2oo7, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”)\nwith the Southern District of Florida in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the conduct at issue in that investigation,\nwhich the non-prosecution agreement identified as including investigations into the defendant’s\nabuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area.” Id. at 3. “In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in\n[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a\nfelony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony. As a result, the defendant :\nwas designated as a sex offender with registration requirements under the national Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act.” Id.\nThe Defense moved on July ll, 2ol9, for pretrial release of Mr. Epstein, arguing that\n“Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various monitoring requirements associated with his\nsex-offender registration actually decrease[s] any danger that he might otherwise pose” and also\nthat “Mr. Epstein has never once atempted to flee the United States.’ Dkt. 6 at l, l2.

Id.\nThe Government contends that these reports together “suggest that an associate of\nEpstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence during the course of the prior investigation,” and\ndemonstrate Mr. Epstein’s “willingness to use intimidation and aggressive tactics in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nwith a criminal investigation.” Dkt. l] at ll.\nThe Government also submits e-mail evidence (atached to this Order as Exhibit l) of )\nplea discussions in 2oo7 between Florida federal prosecutors and Mr. Epstein’s atorneys that\n|\nconfirm that Mr. Epstein considered pleading guilty to witness tampering, harassment and/or\nobstruction of justice in a case involving alleged sex crimes with minor girls.

Individual II was also named and featured prominently in the\nMiami Herald report. |\nThe Government states there is good reason to infer that Mr. Epstein was atempting to\n“influence [these two] individuals who were close to him during the time period charged in this\ncase and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.” Dkt. ll at ll. “Neither of these\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000496.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 25 of 33 |\n|\n“Defendant is currently, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country\nother than the United States.” Dkt. 23 at 2. |\nDefense counsel contends that Defendant has one active passport that was surrendered\nand that “Mr. Epstein has no foreign passports.” Dkt. 6 at 3 n. 3. With regard to the Austrian\npassport, the Defense explains that “Epstein . . . acquired the passport in the l98os, when\nhijackings were prevalent, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal\nprotection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers,\nhijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur.” Dkt. 24 at 8.

But the defendant’s possession of what purports to be a\nforeign passport issued under an alias gives rise to the inference the defendant knous hou to\nobtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities. This adds to the serious |\nrisk of flight posed by the defendant.”). The Government also argues that “the passport contains |\nnumerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter |\nFrance, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the l98os.” Dkt. 3o. By submission\ndated July l8, 2ol9, the Defense explains: “Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend . . |\n. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration :\nor customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect\nMr. Epstein’s entries or exits.” Dkt. 3l.\nDefense counsel has submited a one page document called “Asset Summary - June 3o,\n2ol9.” It indicates that Epstein has cash in the amount of $56,547,773; fixed income valued at\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000508.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32-l _ Filed o7/l8/l9” Page 4 of 47\n,Case 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-9 Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 2 of 2\nVillafana, Ann Marie C, (USAFLS)\n; From: Jay Lefkouitz (JLefkouitz@kirklard.com]\n| nt: Wednescay, September *9, 2oo7 ll:36 AM\n| : Villefana, Ann Marie C.

Epstein, l9-cr-49o (RMB) and U.S. v.\nMaxwell, 2o-cr-33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,\n\nWe write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from\nthe Department of Justice on July 25, 2o25, advising that the Court is seeking leters on behalf of\nvictims seting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!\n\nBy the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s actions. To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n\n‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n? Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000768.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of5\nBSF\n\nA. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000786.jpg": "Cas@-4Sol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles OV lSuisageaye FoF 33 |\nll, Ex. l at l. The Government also contends that “[i]n light of the strength of the Government’s |\nevidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction [45 |\nyears], there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant :\nwealth, his ounership of and access to private planes capable of international travel, and his\nsignificant international ties.” Id.\nThe Government also provides the follouing background information: “In or about 2oo5,\nthe defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with :\nallegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The investigation\nultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\n| District of Florida and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews with victims based in the\nPalm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count One of the instant\nIndictment. In the fall of 2oo7, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”)\nwith the Southern District of Florida in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the conduct at issue in that investigation,\nwhich the non-prosecution agreement identified as including investigations into the defendant’s\nabuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area.” Id. at 3. “In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in\n[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a\nfelony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony.

Individual II was also named and featured prominently in the\nMiami Herald report. |\nThe Government states there is good reason to infer that Mr. Epstein was atempting to\n“influence [these two] individuals who were close to him during the time period charged in this\ncase and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.” Dkt. ll at ll. “Neither of these\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo8oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000808.jpg": "Cas@’4Sol4-4648o-RMEDbeuMenPsH Piles KV lSusageages Of 33 |\n|\n“Defendant is currently, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country\nother than the United States.” Dkt. 23 at 2. |\nDefense counsel contends that Defendant has one active passport that was surrendered\nand that “Mr. Epstein has no foreign passports.” Dkt. 6 at 3 n. 3. With regard to the Austrian\npassport, the Defense explains that “Epstein . . . acquired the passport in the l98os, when\nhijackings were prevalent, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal\nprotection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers,\nhijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur.” Dkt. 24 at 8.

But the defendant’s possession of what purports to be a\nforeign passport issued under an alias gives rise to the inference the defendant knous hou to\nobtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities. This adds to the serious |\nrisk of flight posed by the defendant.”). The Government also argues that “the passport contains |\nnumerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter |\nFrance, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the l98os.” Dkt. 3o. By submission\ndated July l8, 2ol9, the Defense explains: “Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend . . |\n. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration :\nor customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect\nMr. Epstein’s entries or exits.” Dkt. 3l.\nDefense counsel has submited a one page document called “Asset Summary - June 3o,\n2ol9.” It indicates that Epstein has cash in the amount of $56,547,773; fixed income valued at\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo8o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000870.jpg": "CaseGa26-2l-oo38 Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNb6S/22/Phag Page of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def.

And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000947.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Tibet 2 oPiled OF2GSBQoP aeenGec? 26oo\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nRR anna\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- : 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. ;\npone ene nnn eee ee ee eX\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM\nIN SUPPORT OF DETENTION\n\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine\nMaxwell, the defendant, poses an extreme risk of flight; that she will not be able to rebut the\nstatutory presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E); and that the Court should\ntherefore order her detained.\n\nThe charges in this case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine\nMaxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial sexual predator, exploited and abused young\ngirls for years. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000949.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36o4AUt Dibeutrenr 2 oPiled OF2GRQoP aeengeot 26oo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses.

In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000954.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBROHAGN 2OdtUMENt/2o FilecOOAG2o2 P ahage of Gfooo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means.

(Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000982.jpg": "Case F-26-4rBOBSHAURDSeuMEeNt IE Hied GPA B2o Pagerse of 28o\n\nMs. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal\ncircumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond.

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly.

In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.

I want to address the notion that\n\n3 the defendant would have surrendered if the government had\n\n4 asked her to. As defense counsel conceded, no offer along\n\n5 those lines was ever made. And of course the government\n\n6 doesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation\n\n7 that their client would surrender.\n\n8 In fact, the fact that the government took these\n\n9 measures to arrest the defendant reflects hou seriously the\n\nlo government takes the risk of the defendant of flight. Why on\nll earth would the government notify the defendant through her\n\nl2 counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if the\nl3 government had serious concerns that she was a risk of flight?\nl4 That is exactly what occurred here.\n\nl5 In addition, it is interesting that defense counsel\n\nl6 notes that it should have been obvious to the government that\nl7 the defendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in\nl8 Civil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined to\nl9 accept service on behalf of plaintiffs who were seeking to sue\n2o the defendant in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with some of these allegations, and\nal they were required to seek leave of the court to serve the\n22 defendant through their counsel.\n23 Your Honor, turning to the question of the defendant's\n24 finances there is still at this point no substantive response\n25 regarding defendant's finances or about the lack of candor to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001078.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel37 of 2oo 74\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl detention was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.\n2 And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time\n3 had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen.\n\n4 I want to respond with respect to the NPA.

The defense's argument, in essence, atempts to\n2o view each of the government's arguments as absolute. But when\n2l you review the totality of the circumstances -- the defendant's\n22 extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,\n23 her unknoun finances and unwillingness to be more candid with\n24 the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail\n25 proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001087.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel46 of 2oo 83\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal defenses based on untimeliness and the nonprosecution\n\n2 agreement, those arguments are asserted in a conclusory fashion\n3 and have been directly countered by the government with\n\n4 citations to law.

Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001219.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a dea Geold G6 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001220.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a Gea Geol l G5 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001223.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAonen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 42743o) 26a geageol 4 G6 22\nUnited States v.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\nemployment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001262.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3ie/2agPiagecs 66l8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001264.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ooBBQHANAt DOctMe rt l/2o 2 Filedeas/2o/PagPage aol66l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence.

The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring strains credulity.

The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

Judge Nathan\nnoted that Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\nits citizens.” (/d.).

(/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll).

Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.

Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001447.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page/7 of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at l-2). Among other things,\nJudge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of\nthe Government’s proffer of evidence. (/d. at lo). Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6).

In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex.

Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 4of lo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 9 of lo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n° Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the preparation of our defense.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool592\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 2o of 26\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

(Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\n\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (i)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.’ In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\n\n'S The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 25 of 26\n\nMs. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal\ncircumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them\nand their families from harm.\n\nThe proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this\nCircuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v.\nEsposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family\nwho was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions),\naff'd, 749 F.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4).

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.” Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n? The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l2 of l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank”). In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9. It is unknoun whether the defendant purchased the\nproperty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool622\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8.

Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page5of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The defendant\nidentifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that,\nas detailed belou, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery\nin this case.\n\nRegarding the defendant’s request in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with access to discovery, the Government\nunderstands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s\nfirst discovery production at the time the Defense Leter was filed—she received the materials on\nTuesday, August ll. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week. Although this\narrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and\nis subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on\nan ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this\napplication should be denied as moot.\n\nC.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 4 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v.

Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J.

As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v.

Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida proceedings.

Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case.

First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files. (Dkt. 63 at 5, 6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe production of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\nproduction by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

The Government has reviewed the proposed redactions to the defense leters\ndated November 25, 2o2o and November 3o, 2o2o.

There is no refutation from the government on that,\nl3 and they have been all over her travel records. The defendant\nl4 has resided here in the past year. She has traveled\n\nl5 internationally and, according to the government, she has\n\nl6 financial means. I will get to that in a moment, Judge. But\nl7 let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has\nl8 financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.\nl9 What do those cases teach? They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions.

I want to address the notion that\n\n3 the defendant would have surrendered if the government had\n\n4 asked her to. As defense counsel conceded, no offer along\n\n5 those lines was ever made. And of course the government\n\n6 doesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation\n\n7 that their client would surrender.\n\n8 In fact, the fact that the government took these\n\n9 measures to arrest the defendant reflects hou seriously the\n\nlo government takes the risk of the defendant of flight. Why on\nll earth would the government notify the defendant through her\n\nl2 counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if the\nl3 government had serious concerns that she was a risk of flight?\nl4 That is exactly what occurred here.\n\nl5 In addition, it is interesting that defense counsel\n\nl6 notes that it should have been obvious to the government that\nl7 the defendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in\nl8 civil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined to\nl9 accept service on behalf of plaintiffs who were seeking to sue\n2o the defendant in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with some of these allegations, and\nal they were required to seek leave of the court to serve the\n22 defendant through their counsel.\n23 Your Honor, turning to the question of the defendant's\n24 finances there is still at this point no substantive response\n25 regarding defendant's finances or about the lack of candor to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 74 of 9l 74\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl detention was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.\n2 And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time\n3 had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen.\n\n4 I want to respond with respect to the NPA. At this\n\n5 point, your Honor, the defense has articulated no legal basis\n\n6 to suggest that the defendant is shielded by the nonprosecution\n7 agreement, and it simoly doesn't make sense that the decision\n\n8 in this case is somehou tactical to avoid concerns about the\n\n9 NPA, when the government charged Jeffrey Epstein with conduct\nlo that fell within the scope of the time period within the\n\nll nonprosecution agreement and stated before the court in\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with bail proceedings in that mater that this is\n\nl3 the government's strong view that that agreement does not bind\nl4 this office whatsoever with respect to any kind of conduct or\nl5 any kind of individual. That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances. The defense's argument, in essence, atempts to\n2o view each of the government's arguments as absolute. But when\n2l you review the totality of the circumstances -- the defendant's\n22 extensive international ties, her conduct over the past year,\n23 her unknoun finances and unwillingness to be more candid with\n24 the court about her resources to flee, her specific bail\n25 proposal which provides absolutely no security to the court --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool95l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001960.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 83 of 9l 83\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal defenses based on untimeliness and the nonprosecution\n\n2 agreement, those arguments are asserted in a conclusory fashion\n3 and have been directly countered by the government with\n\n4 citations to law.

Ms. Maxwell is nou aware of the\n8 potential strength of the government's case against her and\n\n9 arguments countering these defenses, thus creating a risk of\n\nlo flight.\n\nll Third, the court considers the defendant's history and\nl2 characteristics and finds that paramount in a conclusion that\nl3 Ms. Maxwell poses a risk of flight. Ms. Maxwell has\n\nl4 substantial international ties and could facilitate living\n\nl5 abroad if she were to flee the United States. She holds\n\nl6 multiple foreign citizenships, has familial and personal\n\nl7 connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of\nl8 significant value.

Likewise, the possibility that Ms. Maxwell could evade\n2 security guards or monitoring is a significant one.\n\n3 The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence\n\n4 that no combination of conditions could reasonably assure her\n\n5 presence in court. The risks are simply too great.\n\n6 Defense cites a number of cases, including Esposito,\n\n7 Dreier, and Madoff, as examples of serious and high-profile\n\n8 prosecutions where the courts, over the government's objection,\n9 granted bail to defendants with significant financial\n\nlo resources. But unlike those defendants, Ms. Maxwell possesses\nll significant foreign connections.\n\nl2 This case is distinguishable for other reasons, as\n\nl3 well. For example, the risk of flight in Esposito appears to\nl4 have been based on the resources available to defendant, not\n\nl5 foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from\nl6 being found.\n\nl7 In Madoff, the defendant had already been released on\nl8 a bail package agreed to by the parties for a considerable\n\nl9 period of time before the government sought detention.

In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act.

(Perry Rep.\n4 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. JJ] 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V).

Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l7 of 36\ntime of her arrest. While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\ninconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with Fo and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\nHampshire, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition. Atempting\nto dounplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can\nirrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.\n(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play.

On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3o of 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page ll of 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. /d. at 83:2l—83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l4 of 22\nUnited States v.

See id. at 84:4-84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A-N, W-X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n4] 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page 5 of l9\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMs. Maxwell, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l9\nBlakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d Cir. l99l) (quotations and citation omited). “‘Similar’ charges\ninclude those that are ‘somewhat alike,’ or those ‘having a general likeness’ to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Werner, 62o F.2d at\n926). Offenses are “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of\nrelated transactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996). By contrast,\noffenses are not “connected” and joinder is inappropriate when “[c]ommission of one of the\noffenses neither depended upon nor necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of the\none act neither constituted nor depended upon proof of the other.” Halper, 59o F.2d at 429.\n\nSimilarly, offenses that are separated by time and location, and were allegedly commited\nunder different circumstances, are not sufficiently connected to warrant joinder. See United\nStates v. Martinez, Nos. S2 92 Cr. 839 (SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-*9 (S.D.N.Y.

There is no allegation that Ms. Maxwell continued\nconspiring with Epstein, or engaged in any misconduct at all, in the intervening time period. In\nfact, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the investigation that led to\nEpstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement in 2oo7, or in its 2ol9 indictment of Epstein, which\ncharged Epstein with sex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5.

Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an unrelated civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l3 of l9\n(Indictment § 2; accord id. 4 8.) As discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, because the statements at issue are not perjurious, the\nquestions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed. None of the questions, or\nany answers, were material to any issue in the defamation action. There were no “crimes”\nconcealed by Ms. Maxwell’s answers which were both true and reflective of the poor\nquestioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate hou statements like:\n“T don’t knou what you are talking about,” an admission that Ms. Maxwell “could not make a\nlist” upon demand, her lack of knouledge about undefined “devices” or “toys” could possibly\n“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the Perjury\nCounts and the Mann Act Counts defies logic and is insufficient to permit joinder under Rule\n8(a). See Boti, 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the\nlink” between structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS agent and separate corruption\ncounts); Mitan, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3 (joinder improper where alleged perjury arose from\nfalse statement in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with defendant’s bail application, not an atempt to “cover up”\nunderlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).\n\nB. The Perjury Counts Should Be Severed Under Rule l4(a) Because Their\n\nInclusion Will Substantially Prejudice Ms. Maxwell at Trial\n\nEven if the Court finds that joinder is proper under Rule 8, the Court should nevertheless\nexercise its discretion to sever Counts Five and Six under Rule l4(a) because of the substantial\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and these proceedings.

It is unclear hou the Government intends to address these issues, houever, a trial\nwith the perjury counts will necessarily involve litigating a complicated defamation action within\na criminal trial, making the trial of this case unnecessarily lengthy and confusing. By May,\n2ol7, shortly before the civil defamation case was dismissed, the mater had generated over 9oo\ndocket entries. Approximately 5o substantive motions relating to the admissibility of expert\ntestimony, deposition testimony, and the admissibility of evidence remained unresolved. Judge\nSweet had yet to rule on evidentiary challenges to thousands of deposition questions and answers\ncontained in dozens of bankers boxes wheeled into his courtroom on dollies. A trial involving\nthe perjury counts may well involve revisiting all of these unresolved issues.\n\nInclusion of the Perjury Counts injects into this case the performance and credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers and may require Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice to testify. Presumably,\nthis would result in disqualification of lawyers who have represented Ms. Maxwell for over five\nyears from the entire trial, even though there is no reason why their testimony would be required\nin <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Mann Act Counts.

By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5of8\n\nIn many cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is lou.

Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o). Had the government\nwaited until that time, it might have been unable to meet its arbitrary July 2 deadline, and its\npress conference touting the indictment and arrest of Ms. Maxwell might have had slightly less\n' The fact that Ms. Maxwell herself is neither Black nor Hispanic does not deprive of her of standing to raise this\nchallenge. “[T]he Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a\nfair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he\nhimself belongs.” Holland v.

In any case, the Court takes\n\n2 comfort in the fact that Ms. Maxwell recognizes that she has\n\n3 the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and evidence at her\n\n4 disposal when the appropriate time comes to fight this fight\n\n5 doun the road.\n\n6 A word about Ms. Maxwell's July 2ol6 deposition.

Ms. Maxwell argues that\nl2 the \"privacy interests of those who resist disclosure\" -- in\nl3 the case of her deposition, Ms. Maxwell's interests -- counsel\nl4 against unsealing deposition transcript. Ms. Maxwell argues\nl5 that her discussion of certain \"intimate maters\" during that\nl6 deposition should remain sealed.\n\nl7 During this deposition, Ms. Maxwell was asked\n\nl8 repeatedly about her oun sexual activity with consenting\n\nl9 adults. Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2ol6\n2o deposition, she provided testimony in response to those\nal questions. As noted earlier, the presumption of public access\n22 does atach to this transcript (although, has the Court has\n23 observed, to a lesser extent than if it were submited in\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a dispositive motion).\n25 Here, houever, public access to certain parts of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 24 of 26\ninterest to stop what would have been a one-way discovery process in favor of Ms. Maxwell, the\ngovernment moved to intervene, representing to Magistrate Judge Freeman, among other things,\nthat:\n\ne “should discovery in civil action go forward, multiple witnesses or potential\nwitnesses at the criminal trial would be subject to deposition”\n\ne “any concern regarding the potential delay of this civil suit is outweighed by the\nconcern that Maxwell would seek to assert her Fifth Amendment rights rather\nthan submit to a deposition in the civil action, and that depositions of other\nwitnesses could potentially interfere with the criminal prosecution”\n\ne “permiting any discovery to proceed in this lawsuit would enable Maxwell to\nseek a preview of trial testimony in the criminal case, and would afford her with a\nbroader array of discovery than she is entitled to in the criminal case”\n\ne “a complaint concerning sexual abuse of minors by Epstein and Maxwell will\ninevitably implicate documents, witnesses, and other evidence that overlaps with\nthe criminal mater, whether or not the plaintiff in this action—or the conduct she\nalleges—has any direct <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the charges in the Indictment”\n\nCase No. 2o-cv-484, Dkt. 8o.\n\nThese admissions make clear that the government was aware of the substantial overlap\nbetween the allegations it investigated more than a decade before this Indictment.

Given that three circuits have held otherwise—and that one of them has\naddressed the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Annabi in detail—it is likely that the Eleventh\nCircuit would follou the weight of authority and hold that absent an express provision to the\ncontrary, a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement executed in the name of “the United\nStates” binds USAOs in other districts.\n\nAs previously demonstrated, there is no conflict between this position and Annabi as\napplied to these facts, because Annabi supports dismissal here.

See Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 27o (emphasis and citation\nomited). Courts in this circuit have routinely recognized the need for evidentiary hearings\nwhere the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement is in genuine\ndispute.

Nov. 5, 2oo3) (noting\nconclusion that “an evidentiary hearing was warranted . . . to determine whether an agreement\nexisted, what its terms were, and whether there was compliance with those terms”).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s request for an evidentiary hearing, and for discovery, is at least as strong\nas that in Feldman. There, the district court denied discovery to a defendant who claimed that\nthe government had served a writ of execution in violation of oral representations made in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the defendant’s plea agreement, holding that the agreement’s merger provision\nbarred the consideration of any oral agreements or representations.

United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)). Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt act in furtherance of the\nalleged conspiracy depends on the scope of the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), for example, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy, and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election\nCommission, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with an alleged scheme to obtain illegal campaign contributions from\nforeign donors. The defendant moved to strike references in the indictment to acts of\nconcealment of the alleged conspiracy. The court expressed concern that “the allegations\nprovide litle detail about the acts” and that “references to the alleged acts of concealment and\ncover-up suggest the inclusion of offenses that are not part of the conspiracy charged in the\nindictment.” /d. at 25. Although the court denied the defendant’s motion to strike, it ordered a\nbill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement and in particular\nwhether and hou the acts of concealment alleged in the indictment were within the scope of the\nconspiracy charged.” /d. at 33. The court added that if the bill of particulars confirmed the\ndefendant’s assertion that the alleged acts of concealment and cover-up were not within the\nalleged scope of the conspiratorial agreement, her motion to strike would be granted. /d. at 26.\n\nHere, the object of the alleged conspiracies—necessarily, under the Mann Act—was not\nto cause any individual to engage in unlawful sex acts with Epstein, but to cause individuals to\ntravel to do so. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, even if proven, could not have furthered\nsuch alleged conspiracies. There is no basis for any reasonable inference that Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 in England furthered a conspiracy to cause Accuser-l,\nAccuser-2, or anyone else to travel. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 even knew Accuser-l\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 23\n\nC.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 3of5\nDefendant’s objections relate to her contention that some of the information contained in the\nredactions has been made public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions to which\nthe Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has\nadmonished “should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo IP’), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). At least some of the redactions to which the\nDefendant objects relate to private “family affairs” of a third party, a factor that “weigh[s] more\nheavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public.” Jd. at lo5l.\nAnd though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions is\npublic, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nsignificant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrouly tailored redactions\ncontained in Exhibit 5.\n\nIn addition, the Court adopts the Defendant’s proposed additional redactions to pages\nl29-l34 of the Government’s brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the\ncivil mater, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a\n“craving for that which is sensational and impure.” Amodeo II, 7l F.3d at lo5l (citation\nomited). The Court thus concludes that such redactions are justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l-l28 of the Government’s brief. To provide some context, the redacted\nportions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating\nto the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the present case. See Dkt. No. 5l.\nBecause the Government’s brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access\nataches, the Government’s redaction requests must be “necessary to preserve higher values and\nonly if the sealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch v.

Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes.

Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case.

For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe Court (l) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena\nto BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule l7(c) returnable\nin advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule l7(c) subpoenas\nbe produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order.\nI. Background\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million\npages of discovery pursuant to the Government’s various discovery obligations, including Rule\nl6. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government,\nincluding material provided pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo and Giglio material.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo289o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002970.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 36 of 239\nprosecutions by those two offices, and only those two offices.4 The defendant therefore cannot\nargue that the word “global” in this provision means that the NPA binds the entire federal\ngovernment.\n\nIn sum, the defendant points to nothing in the text of the NPA that could possibly be\nconstrued to bind other districts. To the contrary, there are affirmative indications in the text that\nthe NPA applies only to the USAO-SDFL. Accordingly, under Annabi, the NPA is only binding\non the USAO-SDFL, and the defendant’s motion fails as a mater of law.\n\nZ. The Defendant Has Offered No Evidence That the NPA Binds Other\nDistricts\n\nAlthough a defendant may offer evidence that the negotiations between the prosecutor and\ndefendant contained a promise to bind other districts, Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626, the defendant has\nfailed to do so here. The defendant’s motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusory\nallegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY.\n\nThe lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a privilege log filed by\nthe USAO-SDFL in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a lawsuit filed by Epstein’s victims. (Def. Mot. | at 22). The\nlog reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other\nstates—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since\nfederal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any\nway establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investigation, let alone\nthat the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the U.S. Atorney’s offices in those states would be\nbound by the NPA.\n\n* Interpreting the term “federal liability” in this provision could not be read to encompass all U.S.\nAtorney’s offices without also interpreting its neighboring term, “state . . . liability,” to refer to\nevery state prosecutor’s office in all fifty states. The USAO-SDFL clearly did not—and could\nnot—make such a broad promise.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo297o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002973.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 239\nOPR that “he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and ‘had no involvement with it.’\nOPR Report at 64 n. lo5.’\n\nBeyond this, the OPR Report and the record in the civil case note contacts with Main\nJustice about the NPA, but only after the NPA was negotiated, drafted, and signed. In the civil\ncase, the district court detailed the history of the plea negotiations—and noted that, after the NPA\nwas signed, Epstein’s counsel appealed to officials in Washington, D.C., hoping to avoid\nenforcement of the NPA’s requirement that Epstein plead guilty to state offenses, as the agreement\nrequired.

As the district\ncourt noted, that appeal was rejected. /d. at l2l3.\n\nIn particular, and follouing the execution of the NPA, the report reflects that the USAO-\nSDFL contacted the CEOS Chief in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a leter from Epstein’s counsel, Kenneth Starr,\nprotesting about complying with certain parts of the NPA.

She\ntold OPR, houever, that she “played no role in” the NPA and did\nnot review or approve the agreement either before or after it was\nsigned.\n7 The OPR Report further reflects that, at the time, a supervisor at the USAO-SDFL noted the\nCEOS had “no approval authority.” OPR Report at 6o.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2973\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 239\n2ol8 respectively, would have testified, and that such testimony would have been exculpatory and\nwould have materially helped the defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at 9-ll). The defendant cannot establish\nthat Casey and Detective Recarey would have testified in a way that would help, rather than hurt,\nthe defendant.\n\nIn particular, the defendant contends that Michael Casey, the purported agent of Minor\nVictim-l, “would be able to testify” about Minor Victim-l’s behavior during the “relevant time\nperiod” and the “lack of any ‘outcry’ or ‘grooming.’” (/d. at lo). The defense suggests that Casey\nnot having related any complaints about Maxwell to “any authority, Ms. Maxwell, or any other\nknoun witness” means that he knew of no complaints. (/d. at 9-lo). As an initial mater, “there\nis no evidence before the Court as to what [Casey] would have testified.” Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d\nat 4oo. Even assuming that Casey would have testified as the defendant nou contends, such\ntestimony (which would be purely speculative and unsubstantiated) would also have no bearing\non whether the abuse, in fact, occurred.\n\nThe defendant argues that Detective Recarey would have testified that none of the\nwitnesses with whom he spoke in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a prior investigation told him about the\ndefendant participating in sex trafficking activities. (Def. Mot. 7 at lo-ll). Asa threshold mater,\nthe defendant has not established hou such testimony, which would consist entirely of hearsay,\ncould even be admissible at the defendant’s trial. Moreover, the fact that Epstein may have abused\nvictims without the defendant’s participation is not exculpatory as to charges alleging the\ndefendant assisted in the grooming and abuse of other victims. The well-established law of this\nCircuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not participate\nin criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during uncharged\nperiods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the charged\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3oo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003026.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 239\nThe protective order, among other things, restricted the parties from disclosing discovery materials\nmarked confidential to third parties, absent express permission from the Court.\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the defamation suit, Maxwell was deposed by Boies Schiller, counsel\nfor Giuffre, on April 22, 2ol6 and July 22, 2ol6.\n\nOn or about May 24, 2ol7, the parties entered into a setlement agreement and voluntarily\ndismissed the civil action.

The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction.

The court\ninquired whether the Government’s position was that “reliance on the nondisclosure of\nconfidential materials to law enforcement in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a grand jury subpoena that has been\nduly authorized would be unreasonable.” (/d. at l4). The Government responded in the\naffirmative, stating that the Government believed a provision precluding compliance with a law\nenforcement request would be void for public policy. (Ud. at l5). The Government further cited\nChemical Bank in support of the proposition that it would be unreasonable to rely on a protective\norder provision that barred the disclosure of information to law enforcement. (/d. at l5-l6).\n\nIn response to questions about the breadth of the subpoena, the Government explained that\nit was “essentially unable to significantly narrou the request for information ... . We have either\nlitle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are [and]\nwho was deposed.” (/d. at l7). In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the protective order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003032.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 239\nBank, of course, as noted above, the subpoena recipient produced materials to a prosecutor in\ndirect violation of the relevant protective order, without seeking a modification of the protective\norder and without any court authorization to do so. l54 F.R.D. at 93. Moreover, in that case, the\nDistrict Atorney seemingly opened its investigation and issued the subpoena in direct response to\ninformation provided by the subpoena recipient who was then a party to civil litigation. /d.\n\nThe Government responded to Chief Judge McMahon by explaining its contacts with Boies\nSchiller in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the instant (and only) investigation it had opened on Epstein, that is,\nthe investigation prompted by, and opened follouing, public reporting on Epstein in November\n2ol8. In particular, the Government explained that the USAO-SDNY opened an investigation\nfirst, on either November 3o, 2ol8 or December 3, 2ol8, and then made contact with Boies Schiller\nshortly thereafter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). In this respect, the Government further explained\nthat the USAO-SDNY, after opening the investigation, had endeavored to identify counsel who\nrepresented victims or witnesses in public filings or media reports, which included Boies Schiller,\nnoting that “[w]ith respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during the\ninvestigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil litigation” and\nindicated that the USAO-SDNY intended to make document requests.

Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’! Equity Invs., Inc. v. Opportunity Equity Partners Ltd., No. o5 Civ. 2745 (JGK)\n(RLE), 2olo WL 7793l4, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2olo) (finding that the parties’ reliance on a\ncivil protective order “was not unreasonable given the nature of the litigation,” but “not so\noverwhelming as to warrant the indefinite application of Martindell’s strong presumption against\nmodification because the order’s broad scope and express language, and the minimal level of court\ninquiry outweigh the Parties’ reliance.”).\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003053.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 239\n\nSecond, the Government did not misrepresent the extent of its knouledge of the contents\nof Boies Schiller’s files. As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government\nhad “either litle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there\nare [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l7). In support of her argument, Maxwell\ncites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David\nBoies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2ol6, asking ‘if the\nSouthern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the\nGovernment has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-l does not\nrecall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-l\ndoes not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury\n(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2ol6 meeting refer to the existence of depositions\ngenerally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general\nunderstanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at\n2l). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knouledge of the\ncontents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon were incorrect.\n\nIn sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief\nJudge McMahon, and as such, the good faith exception applies. To the contrary, the record before\nthe Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nquestion and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knouledge of the contents of that file,\nand the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the protective order.\nUpon receiving a court order issued by a Chief United States District Judge who had carefully\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 239\nlawsuit against the defendant or took her deposition years before the Government initiated its oun\ninvestigation. The defendant offers no evidence to the contrary, and there is no reason to believe,\non this record, that the Government in any way controlled Boies Schiller when it litigated a civil\ncase against the defendant. As such, the Fifth Amendment does not apply.\n\nThe defendant’s claim further fails because without coercion or compulsion, there is no\nFifth Amendment violation. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 42o, 43l (l984) (rejecting claim\nthat a “failure to inform [the defendant] of the Fifth Amendment privilege barred use of his\nconfession at trial”); United States v.

Mast, 735 F.2d 745,\n75o (2d Cir. l984) (same). The defendant implicitly argues that she only testified under oath in\nthe civil mater because she thought she would not be held to that oath. In other words, had she\nknoun that she would be subject to the penalties of perjury, she would have invoked her Fifth\nAmendment right. But the defendant’s misguided expectation that she would face no\nconsequences cannot be said to coerce speech. The defendant, represented by able counsel,\nvoluntarily chose to waive her Fifth Amendment rights and testify under oath. And she chose to\ndo so in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with civil depositions that occurred over two years before the Government\nopened its investigation. The circumstances surrounding that decision come nouhere near the type\nof coercion that rises to the level of a Fifth Amendment violation. See, e.g., United States v. Ash,\n464 F.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In Valentine, the\ndefendant was convicted of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o. The Second Circuit reversed\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 239\nF.2d at 929). Offenses may be joined “where the same evidence may be used to prove each count\nor if the counts have a sufficient logical <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>.” United States v. Page, 657 F.3d l26, l29\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). “For purposes of analysis under\nRule 8(a),” houever, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish ‘similarity’ of offenses,\nand each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v. Blakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d\nCir. l99l) (internal quotations and citations omited). For instance, in United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o), the “Second Circuit found sufficient similarity between two cargo\nthefts that occurred two years apart and only one of which was violent in nature,” because “both\noffenses arose out of [defendant’s] scheme to use his position as an insider . . . to obtain money or\nproperty carried by it.’” United States v.

App’x 636, 638 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (first alteration in original)\n(quoting Werner, 62o F2d at 927).\n\nJoinder is also proper for “distinct criminal acts where they originated from a common\nscheme.” United States v. Ying Lin, No. l5 Cr. 6ol (DLI), 2ol8 WL 5ll3l39, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. l9, 2ol8) (citing Werner, 62o F.2d at 927). Specifically in the context of perjury, “[t]he law\nin this circuit clearly supports the joinder of underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts\nwhere, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.” United States v. Potamitis,\n739 F.2d 784, 79l (2d Cir. l984); see United States v. Sweig, 44l F.2d ll4, ll8 (2d Cir. l97l).\nFalse statements can “concern” or be connected with substantive offenses even if they were not\nmade as part of an investigation into the specific substantive conduct. See United States v. Ruiz,\n894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir. l99o) (joining false statements on loan applications with perjury about\n“atempts to secure Senate Ethics Commitee approval” of “consulting fees’); United States v.\nBroccolo, 797 F.

It is setled law in this Circuit that joinder of “underlying substantive crimes with perjury\ncounts” is appropriate “where, as here, the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.”\nPotamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l; see also United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (same). In\nRuiz, the defendant was a New York state senator who founded a nonprofit that was developing a\nmall in the Bronx, and for which he provided consulting services. In l984 and l985, he made two\nloan applications for funds to invest in the project, on which he made false statements. /d. at 5o3-\no4. In l986, the defendant also lied about his possession of a leter from the Senate Ethics\nCommitee to a grand jury that was investigating his consulting activities for the nonprofit. /d. at\n5o3. He was charged with two counts of false statements on the loan applications and one count\nof perjury, and he moved to sever the perjury charge. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that, although the “alleged perjury did not occur during a specific investigation by the\ngrand jury into the alleged bank fraud,” the statements nonetheless “‘concerned the defendant’s\nscheme to maximize his personal gain from the [project], as well to cover any improprieties that\nscheme might involve.’” Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 7o2 F.\nSupp. lo66, lo76-77 (S.D.N.Y. l989)) (emphasis omited). And the Second Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that the counts had “sufficient logical <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>” because they all “relate to [the\ndefendant’s] extra-senatorial activities through the [nonprofit],” and therefore were “part of a\ncommon scheme or plan.” Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5. So too here: the defendant’s perjury did not\noccur in the context of a grand jury investigation into the same sexual offenses charged in the\nIndictment, but the statements concerned those offenses and sought to conceal the defendant’s role\n\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7l of 239\ntherein. See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o-9l (joining counts involving use of businesses to\ncommit fraud with a count of falsely swearing in bankruptcy court that the defendant “had not\nengaged in any business activity during the preceding six years”).°? Accordingly, and consistent\nwith the holdings in Ruiz and Broccolo, this Court should deny the severance motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that the offenses are not connected because they involve different\ntime periods. To be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct involving certain victims from\nl994 to l997, while the perjury counts charge statements made in 2ol6 in a case conceming\nGiuffre’s abuse from l999 to 2oo2. Houever, the specific statements charged in Count Five and\nCount Six directly relate to the conduct charged in Counts One through Four, including, in one\ninstance, a specific victim identified as relevant to those counts. And those statements were not\ntime-bound or restricted to Giuffre. For instance, the defendant denied the existence of any scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not the existence of such a scheme between l999\nand 2oo2, or a scheme specifically focused on Giuffre. The defendant also denied ever giving\nanyone a massage, specifically including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. She did not limit her denial\nto Giuffre or to a particular time period. There is, accordingly, a strong <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the\ntruth or falsity of the defendant’s broad denials and her acts in the period at issue in the substantive\ncounts. The cases on which the defendant relies are factually inapposite and do not support her\nargument, because they involve wholly unrelated events. See, e.g., United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43l (2d Cir. l978) (severing a Medicaid fraud indictment from a tax evasion indictment\nwhere the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation of people he had employed—different\n°3 While the defendant may argue that the fact that her deposition, unlike Ruiz, did not involve\ncriminal authorities counsels in favor of a different outcome, as discussed further belou, the\nprospect of a criminal prosecution was nonetheless plainly on her mind at the time of the\ndepositions, as evidenced by the myriad arguments she herself makes in support of her motions to\nsuppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4, Def.\nMot. ll at 2).\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 239\nof proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permited joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of\nappellant’s Rule l4 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *6-*7.\n\nThe defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-bloun re-\nlitigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To\nlitigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of\nthe civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury\nwill be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated\nin Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—\nand, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could\nbe crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a\npseudonym to avoid any <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And\nany remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider\nGiuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at l3o-3l\n(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony\nconviction); Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 5o6 U.S. at 54o (“[JJuries are\npresumed to follou their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). There is\nevery reason to think a jury could and would follou such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546\nF.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the\nsexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United\nStates v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (using a limiting instruction to address\nspillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were\nsevered, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false\ndenials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 348\nWW. JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “(t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4.

Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 253 of 348\nprosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the\nplea was entered on June 3o, 2oo8.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nFrom my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it\n\nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial. So to me, saying to a victim\n\nthe case is nou back under investigation is perfectly accurate.\n\n4. February — March 2oo8: Villafatia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.°®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**! Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n368 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order.

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot.

The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun.

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell\nwith facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around\nl994 to l997. The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two\ncounts of perjury in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to\nbegin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl superseding\nindictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those\nmotions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking\ncount and another related conspiracy count.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than\nthose seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and\nthis Opinion, deal exclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3675\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations.

In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions. Significantly, Judge Sweet’s Order prefaced all the listed categories with\nthe words “sexual activity” an “sexual activities.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury conviction. The courts holding is equally applicable here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v.

She shared these\nphotographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein.\nThe Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these\nphotographs.\n\nPerhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had\ndirect connections to other pouerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and\nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a\nmodel scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.\npassports for young girls to “work” as models.

Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal.

See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\nidentified as potential co-conspirators.

The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim.

The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pageloofl7\nguilt or should be so incredible that its very implausibility suggests that it was created to conceal\nguilt.” United States vy.

Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v. United States,\n557 U.S. llo, l2l-l22 (2oo9).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page3oflo\nPage 3\n\nbeyond the Mann Act counts. But the defense did. And notwithstanding that understanding, the\ndefense at no point suggested that it would seek to adjourn the trial date if the Court denied its\nseverance motion. Given the defense’s expansive view of the amount of evidence and time that\nwould be required to complete a trial of the perjury counts, their removal from the equation should\nlargely make up for the additional trial time required to address the new charges and allegations\nregarding Minor Victim-4 in the S2 Indictment. Similarly, nou that the defense no longer has to\nprepare immediately for what it predicted would be a “collateral trial on whether Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre’s statements about an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat 9-lo), defense counsel can prepare for a trial that includes the allegations regarding Minor\nVictim-4.\n\nMoreover, as noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government fully intends to focus its\npresentation of evidence at trial primarily on the experiences of the four victims referenced in the\nS2 Indictment. As the Government has previewed in its conferrals with defense counsel, the\nGovernment anticipates introducing evidence regarding a small number of additional victims\neither as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies or pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b). The Government does not expect that this additional evidence will significantly lengthen\nthe trial, particularly because much of this evidence will come from witnesses and exhibits that\nwill already be introduced in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the four victims referenced in the S2 Indictment.\nThis streamlined approach will ensure both that the length of trial is not significantly expanded\nand that the defense will be able to focus its trial preparation on addressing the allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause.

The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, production of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v.

The subpoena is admissible either as part of the writen motion practice or in a\nhearing on the motions to suppress. Indeed, the Court could take judicial notice of the document\nwhich is in the SDNY court files. Ms. Maxwell would then be the only party to the motion\npractice that was in the dark about the content of the subpoena. What the subpoena commands,\nwhen it was served, and who accepted service are all relevant to the issues before the Court.\nBSF’s only retort is that Ms. Maxwell should get the subpoena from the government.

Thus, the time period alleged in both Counts Five and Six falls\nsquarely within the date range covered by the NPA for which Ms. Maxwell is immunized.\nMoreover, l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) is one of the five enumerated offenses in the NPA. (Ex. B at 2 of\n7). As such, Counts Five and Six are clearly offenses covered by the NPA.\n\nMs. Maxwell also cannot be prosecuted on Counts Five and Six because they are based\non the exact same allegations that were already thoroughly investigated by the Palm Beach FBI\nand USAO-SDFL and were presented to a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida Investigation. The allegations underlying Counts Five and Six (and\nthe expanded date range for Counts One and Three) come from a single accuser—Accuser-4—\nwho alleges that Epstein sexually abused her from approximately 2ool-2oo4 and that Ms.\nMaxwell allegedly facilitated that abuse. (S2 Indictment 9] 9d, 22-27). Based on our review of\nthe prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, which the government only recently produced to\nthe defense on April l3, 2o2l, we knou that FBI Special Acn | i\ninterviewed the person we believe to be Accuser-4 in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida Investigation.\n(Ex. C at 22:l-l7).* We also knou that Special Agen i presented her allegations—\nthe very same allegations that form the basis for Counts Five and Six—to the grand jury in the\nSouthern District of Florida in support of a proposed 6o-count federal indictment of Jeffrey\nEpstein ee.

As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).\nHence, these provisions of the NPA reflect Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not become\nembroiled in subsequent prosecutions of his “potential co-conspirators” in any other districts.\n(Dkt. 223 at ll).\n\nMoreover, this result is consistent with fundamental fairness. Allouing a federal district\nto prosecute a defendant for an offense that is identical to one that was already resolved as part of\n® For the same reasons, the Court is not bound by subsequent Second Circuit decisions interpreting Annabi, which\nhave found that the use of phrases like “the United States” or “the government” in a plea agreement does not create\nan “affirmative appearance” to bind other districts.

See United\nStates v.

They represent the United States, and their promises on behalf of the\nGovernment must bind each other absent express contractual limitations or disavouals to the\ncontrary.”). For these reasons, the NPA bars the USAO-SDNY from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell\nfor the offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment. They must therefore be\ndismissed.\n\nC. Counts One and Three Must Also Be Dismissed.\n\nBecause Counts Five and Six must be dismissed, the expanded Mann Act conspiracies\ncharged in Counts One and Three must also be dismissed. In the Sl Indictment, the conspiracies\ncharged in Counts One and Three were confined to a four-year period from l994-l997, which\nthe Court found was not covered by the NPA. (Dkt. 2o7 at 6-7). In the S2 Indictment, by\ncontrast, the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three cover a much broader timeframe\nfrom l994-2oo4 because they incorporate the same conduct from 2ool-2oo4 involving Accuser-\n4 charged in Counts Five and Six. As previously discussed, the NPA bars the government from\nprosecuting Ms. Maxwell for these offenses. Hence, as currently charged, the government could\noffer inadmissible evidence excluded by the NPA as proof of Counts One and Three. It would\nbe impermissible for the jury to consider such evidence in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Counts One and\nThree and any guilty verdict based on proof related to Accuser-4, or any other conduct covered\nby the NPA, might require reversal.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 45 of 349\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 98 of 349\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l58 of 349\n4.

Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not.

Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.

Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 254 of 349\nprosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the\nplea was entered on June 3o, 2oo8.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nFrom my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it\n\nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial. So to me, saying to a victim\n\nthe case is nou back under investigation is perfectly accurate.\n\n4. February — March 2oo8: Villafaia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n3. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34l The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-oooo455l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 262 of 349\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.*®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\ntbe Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4559\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 268 of 349\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\n\nB.

Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida criminal case.\"!3\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne § Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafaia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\noa According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 325 of 349\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The\nGovernment then conducted two preliminary interviews with Minor Victim-4 by video\nteleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the difficult nature of the interview topics,\nhouever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4 over video. Due to travel\nconstraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic, the Government was unable\nto travel to meet with Minor Victim-4 until late January 2o2l, at which time the Government\nconducted multiple in-person interviews with Minor Victim-4. The Government then took\nadditional investigative steps and sought the S2 Indictment in late March 2o2l, approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges. Any suggestion that the Government\nintentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in\nfact. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay, much less an\nintentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nFinally, the defendant again asks the Court to “defer consideration of this motion until\ntrial.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The Court should again reject the defendant’s invitation to defer ruling\non this motion. See Apr. Op. at l8 (denying motion but allouing renewal of motion if the “factual\nrecord at trial shous otherwise’); see also United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS), 2olo WL\n289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

Notably, though, when Minor\nVictim-4 was deposed in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit after she was interviewed during the\nUSAO-SDFL’s investigation but more than a decade before the defendant was indicted in this\ncase, Minor Victim-4 affirmatively stated that the defendant was one of the individuals who\nscheduled her massage appointments with Epstein. Minor Victim-4 was not asked any follou-up\nquestions about the defendant during that deposition, but her prior consistent statement regarding\nthe defendant’s involvement in scheduling her massages severely undercuts the defense’s\nsuggestion that Minor Victim-4 entirely fabricated the defendant’s role in Epstein’s scheme after\nthe defendant was indicted in 2o2o.

The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that “[t]he trial court, just like the trial\ncourt and intermediate appellate court in Cosby’s case, has agreed to let the government out of its\ndeal.” The Op-Ed further claims that this case is “extremely weak” and asserts that “[a] jury should\nreject those flimsy and stale charges.” The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.*\n\nB.

Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\nthe need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by\nothers) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flatering\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 36 of 8o\nknouledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, so long as the probative value of\nthe evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\"° The court then determined that the\ntestimony of the five prior bad act witnesses—and the deposition testimony pertaining to\nthe prior use of Qualudes—was admissible to demonstrate Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design. The trial court reasoned that the similarity and distinctiveness of the\ncrimes bore a logical <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to Constand’s allegations, and amounted to a “signature\nof the same perpetrator.”'’ Comparing the past and present allegations, the court noted\nthat each woman was substantially younger than Cosby and physically fit; that Cosby\ninitiated the contact with each woman, primarily though her employment; that each\nwoman came to trust Cosby and view him as a friend or mentor; that each woman\naccepted an invitation to a place that Cosby controlled; that each woman consumed a\ni T.C.O. 96-97 (citing Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)).

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby.

The Government’s Application :\nIn late November or early December 2ol8, the Government commenced an investigation |\ninto Epstein and others for unlawfully trafficking minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, |\nl594(c) and unlawfully enticing minors in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b). (Sealed Aff. and |\nAppl. of AUSA Alex Rossmiller dated Feb. 5, 2ol9 (““Gov’t Appl.”), Dkt. No. l, § 3.) ;\nAs part of that investigation, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller\n“requiring the production of copies of discovery and related materials in [the Giuffre Action].” |\n(Gov’t Appl., J 5.) These materials are arguably subject to the Protective Order. |\nOn February 5, 2ol9, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |\nSweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § l65l(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |\nProtective Order so that it could respond to the subpoena.

In fact, at\nleast one district court in this Circuit has held that “stipulated, umbrella confidentiality orders are\nnot per se improvident even if good cause was not shoun.” Int’l Equity Invs., Inc. v.

Apr. l2,\n2olo), aff'd, 4l5 F. App’x 286 (2d Cir. 2oll).\nThe Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet was certainly not “improvidently granted”\nunder the standard articulated in Dorset. The Protective Order was granted on the basis of\nlegitimate privacy concerns on the part of both Giuffre and Maxwell, as well as third parties. See\nIn re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., l56 B.R. 4l4, 435 (S.D.N.Y. l993), aff'd, l7 F.3d 6oo (2d Cir.\nl994) (finding “no shouing of improvidence where the justifications for the Protective Orders\n[were] immediately apparent”), Material turned over in discovery that was ultimately used at :\ntrial would have been publicly available.

The Second Circuit may well be on the verge of making material used in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> |\nwith the summary judgment motions publicly available, though of course I cannot predict what |\norder will ultimately issue from the Court of Appeals. And there does not appear to be any |\n|\nproblem with the entry of a Protective Order that specifically contemplates case-by-case |\nconsideration of whether materials filed with the court should or should not be sealed. |\nI have no idea whether Judge Sweet made the requisite findings in his decisions granting |\n|\nthe various motions to seal publicly-filed documents that were made in Giuffre.

In )\nMartindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |\n“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the maters in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with |\nwhich the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |\ngrand jury investigative processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |\nthe mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 4o |\nF.3d 592 (2d Cir. l994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :\nshouing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |\none day invoke the Fifth Amendment at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |\nprosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |\ncivil proceeding]... [.] Prosecutors often make do without the testimony of a defendant.” Jd. at |\n595-96 (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296). |\nHere, houever, the extraordinary amount of publicity surrounding all aspects of what I |\nwill call the Epstein mater does create practical limitations to the grand jury’s ability to secure |\ncertain information with the secrecy it requires to conduct an appropriately thorough and |\nthoughtful investigation. Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a situation in |\nwhich the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |\nindependently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743.

I have not been provided any of the trial discovery.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v. State Bar of\nNevada, 5ol U.S. lo3o, lo74 (l99l) (stating that “lawyers representing clients in\npending cases may be regulated” by substantial prejudice standard and not\nheightened general First Amendment standard of clear danger) (emphasis added); id.\nat lo76 (“The regulation of atorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that\nis substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect ... applying equally to all\natorneys participating in a pending case’) (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument.

On Episode 3, Mr. Kuvin, who is identified as “Victim’s\nAtorney,” stated: “When you capture someone like [Ghislaine Maxwell] I don’t\nbesmirch the U.S. Government from taking a victory lap. To be able to come back one\nyear later and say ‘we’ve got the co-conspirator’, they wanted a litle good press, as well\nthey should. Take her doun and embarrass the hell out of her.

Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v.

She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Epstein investigation.

Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 54\nafter 2ol9, including testimony from two of the Minor Victims, any <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the\nevidentiary background of the USAO-SDFL’s charging decisions or this Office’s 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and the defendant’s guilt or innocence is atenuated.\n\nIt is not the Government’s view of the evidence at any one time that maters—it is the\nview of the jury considering the evidence before it, and past charging decisions have no bearing\non that evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr. 7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6,\nat *l (S.D.N.Y.

At trial, the questions for the jury will be whether, based on the evidence presented,\nthe defendant participated in the charged Mann Act and sex trafficking offenses. Nothing about\nthe decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office has any bearing on the defendant’s guilt or\ninnocence.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2ol2),\nonly underscores this point. In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247. White was traveling in a\nvehicle with four other people on the day of his arrest, and “[t]he defense’s strategy was to seek\nto demonstrate that the [firearm in question] was found in the vehicle and not on White’s\nperson.” Jd. at 238.

The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others.

Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d.

Because Accuser-3’s allegations are conceptually distinct, they are also not\n“necessary to complete the story” of the charged conspiracies. See Cummings, 6o F.

The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

See Fed. R.

The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\nintroduced as proof of concealment of those offenses. See United States v. Marcus Schloss &\nCo., Inc., 7lo F.

Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def.

The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005893.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005983.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 52\n\ne The government denies Ms. Maxwell’s argument that “a lay jury will be unable to\napply Dr. Rocchio’s analyses to the facts of this case” because “[t]hat is not hou\nRule 7o2 works.” Resp. at 2o.

Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance.

That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87).

The Court was unpersuaded by the defendant’s offer to consent to extradition, noting\nthat the “legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained\n“fundamentally unchanged.” (/d. at ll-l3). The Court further explained that the defendant’s\n“extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at l3).\n\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant’s “patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly” on its assessment of her history\nand characteristics.

The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o).

The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail application does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 4l\nProp., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts to act as . .. vehicles for factual\nnarrative”). This “opinion” should be precluded.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\nassault do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006303.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6of:\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “...[W]here father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page8oflil\nHoldings, Inc., No. l6-CV-2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

Dr.\nRocchio’s first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding hou a minor may be\nenticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force.

Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)).

In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction for being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm. /d. at 238. “The only significant issue at trial was whether\nWhite possessed a firearm, and, more specifically, whether the jury would believe the officers’\nclaim that one was recovered from his front pocket.” Jd. at 247.

Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA.

The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others.

Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll96\n(2d Cir. l993). These conditions precedent are “[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the\nadmissibility of evidence” as referenced in Fed. R.

Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v.

Because Accuser-3’s allegations are conceptually distinct, they are also not\n“necessary to complete the story” of the charged conspiracies. See Cummings, 6o F.

(quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

App'x 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (no foundation\nexisted to establish that the emails were what the defendant asserted, and the proposed method of\nintroducing them through an investigator with no personal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>—beyond seeing them in\nan inbox—was insufficient).\n\nIII. Detective Recarey’s Absence Implicates Ms. Maxwell’s Right to Confront and\n\nCross-Examine Witnesses\n\nThe Confrontation Clause protects a criminal defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Limitation on cross-examination may violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation\nClause if it prevents the defendant from, among other things, exposing a witness's biases,\nmotivation, or incentives for lying, or eliciting testimony that is relevant and material to the\ndefense. United States v. Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, 956 F.3d 99, ll4 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to encounter witnesses\n“face-to-face.” Coy v. Ioua, 487 U.S. lol2, lol7 (l988). As the Supreme Court has noted, this\nright “traces back to the beginnings of Western legal culture” and has, throughout generations,\nensured fairness in criminal proceedings—both actual and apparent. /d. at lol6-l8.\n\nThe admission of the seized evidence is based on Government Exhibit 295, the affidavit\nof Detective Recarey.

It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell objects to the\nfollouing exhibits pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 4ol, 4o3 and 4o4(b):\n\nI.

These items are inadmissible for the reasons discussed in\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion to Exclude Items Purportedly Seized During Search of 358 El Brillo Way\non October 2o, 2oo5. In addition to problems related to the evidentiary foundation of these items,\nthey are not relevant to any issue in this case. The unopened boxes were purportedly seized in\n2oo5, after the end of any conspiracy alleged here. No witness will identify these items as having\nbeen in Ms. Maxwell’s possession or used in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with any crime alleged in the\nindictment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def.

The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Background\n\nBoth the first and second superseding indictments described the defendant and Epstein’s\n\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-3.

The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant. The Jencks Act materials and exhibits contained the only co-\nconspirator statements in the Government’s possession that will be offered at trial.

Where a victim is suing\nan employer or organization in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the sexual abuse of a minor\nby an employee or volunteer, it has become commonplace for the victim’s\nadvocate to argue that the failure to detect “grooming” was negligent on the\npart of the employer or organization. If their use of the term “grooming”\nalways encompassed excessive focus on a particular child, time alone with\nthe child, or inappropriate touching, this usage might not be problematic, but\nwhen “grooming” is applied to such common and desirable behaviors as\nbeing kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of mis-\nleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well-\nestablished predictors of child sexual abuse when there is no evidence\nwhatsoever that they can help discriminate between good employees and vol-\nunteers, on the one hand, and risky employees and volunteers, on the other\nhand. In the litigation context, efforts to expand the concept of “grooming” to\nencompass desirable behaviors that are not associated with elevated risk is\nmisleading, particularly when coupled with the presumption or suggestion\nthat “grooming” always reflects an intent or plan to offend or, worse, that an\noffense can be proved by the fact that the accused engaged in “grooming.”\nSeduction\nAlthough I agree with Lanning (2ol8) that the term “seduction” is preferable\nto the term “grooming,” at least when there is an opportunity to explain hou\nsimilar the seduction of a child is to the seduction of an age-appropriate part-\nner, there is ample historical reason to be cautious about the use of the term\n“seduction” in this context without further explanation. This is because of\ntwo archaic usages of “seduction” in the older literature.\nArchaic Usage #l: Seduction as a Euphemism for the Offense\nOne of the archaic usages of “seduction,” found often in the older scientific\nliterature, is as a vague euphemism for any occurrence of child sexual abuse\nor an event that may have been sexually simulating to the child, as in these\npassages:\n\ne “[A] shock of some kind is held responsible for the neurosis—an\natack by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual view-\ning of parental coitus...” (Isacs, l928, p. l93).\n\ne “... I wondered whether the precocity of these fantasies and their\nfrequency might not be due to actual seduction that the child had expe-\nrienced...” (Rank, l942, p. 56).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006818.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “... It was expected that a <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 52\n\ne The government denies Ms. Maxwell’s argument that “a lay jury will be unable to\napply Dr. Rocchio’s analyses to the facts of this case” because “[t]hat is not hou\nRule 7o2 works.” Resp. at 2o. Responds the government: “That is precisely hou\nRule 7o2 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which the\nRule contemplates.” /d. at 2l.

This argument flips the\nproper analysis on its head. It’s the government’s burden to prove reliability. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7). It’s not Ms.\nMaxwell’s burden to prove unreliability (though if it were her burden, she would\nhave met it).\n\ne The government says that “the causal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between . . . psychological\nproblems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror”\nand is relevant to the alleged victims’ credibility. Resp. at 24. It’s not, and any\nminor probative value the evidence has is substantially outweighed by the danger\nof unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o3.

The risk highlighted by the defense it its\nfootnote is that, even though they are not asked a question that calls for opinion testimony, the\nagents are likely to try to offer their opinions either during the defense's questioning or when the\ngovernment atempts to rehabilitate them. Because neither side has noticed any opinion\ntestimony from the case agents, they should be prohibited from offering any, especially because\nit will be non-responsive to any questions that should be asked of them.\nIX. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE TESTIMONY ABOUT ANY ALLEGED\n“RAPE” BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nThe government argues that the expected testimony of [J that she was raped\nby Jeffrey Epstein is admissible to shou the “ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims” and is necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Resp. at\n79-8o. The government offers no explanation, houever, for why testimony of an alleged rape\nwould prove the relationship “between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when gay\nhas never claimed in her prior statements to the FBI or anywhere else that Ms. Maxwell knew of,\nfacilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in any way. Nor does the government explain why\nthis testimony is somehou necessary “to complete the story of the crime on trial” when the rape\nallegation is an outlier and does not fit the “story” of alleged sexual abuse that the government\nhas described in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged victims to gradually break\ndoun their inhibitions so that forcible rape is not required to engage in sexual activity with them.\nBecause the rape allegation is the only one of its kind and has no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the other\nincidents of alleged sexual abuse, it should not be admited as intrinsic proof of the charged\ncrimes.

What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another.

Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q.

When you talk about \"trauma,\" that's the definition you've\niy been using, correct?\n6 A. Trauma is a continuum, so that is one of the definitions of\n7 \"trauma,\" but other things have been found to be traumatic in\n8 individuals' experiences that do not necessarily rise to the\n9 level of criterion A in PTSD.

The secure\nInternet <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> will enable the trial teams in the courtroom to stay connected to their\nonline case repositories and resources during critical moments of the proceedings. This\nwill facilitate the effective and efficient presentation of evidence. In addition, the parties\nwill be able to reduce the files they bring into the courtroom, as well as the traffic to and\nfrom the courtroom during proceedings. Although the parties understand that the\ncourtroom also has Wi-Fi access, which is available for use, a high-speed wired <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nensures a faster internet <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> and will avoid connectivity issues.\n\nSubject to the Court’s approval, the parties will retain Courtroom Connect to\nprovide these services. Courtroom Connect does not require any court resources to provide\nservice and currently maintains a network in the courthouse that is loo% independent of\nthe Court’s internal network. Set up, installation and service fees will be paid for by the\nparties at no cost to the Court.\n\nOther trials in federal courts have utilized a high-speed <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the Internet\nin the courtroom, including United States v.

What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. I am.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\n22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q.

I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\nae hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

This comment about Epstein’s distinct decorating style may seem implausible to jurors.

Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov.

For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to Epstein. LF\nPO he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'!

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record.

Likewise\nincorporating the factual allegations of the conspiracy count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,\nalong with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching\nscheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the\nJenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.\n\nThe proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an investment representative at Deutsche Bank\nAlex Broun and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax\nfraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\nfinancial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009531.jpg": "Case lf2oser3oo33o& AbcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed Ggeah Pageagei42 of ll7\n‘A-6o8o\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 7 of 4l\n2. Parse’s Personal Tax Evasion\n\nParse executed his oun fraudulent SOS tax shelter transaction to eliminate the gains he\neared in 2ooo, and received a free fraudulent opinion leter from J&G. The losses Parse created —\n$3,ooo,ooo — were larger than Parse needed for the 2ooo year, suggesting that he intended to\neliminate taxes in more than one year. On his 2ooo tax return, Parse claimed a $l,278,7o6\nfraudulent loss, evading $5l7,542 in taxes on over $2.l million in income. See GX lool-l32 (Parse\n2ooo Tax Return); GX looo-52 (IRS Certificate of Assessment and Payments for Parse’s 2ooo\nTaxes); GX 54-l (J&G Opinion Leter for Parse). Parse's receipt of a free opinion leter, which\nwould have otherwise cost him no less than $9o,ooo (and likely more)’ had he paid the going rate\nfor a J&G opinion leter, violated Deutsche Bank's gift prohibition policy and almost certainly\nviolated the law, in that it constituted his receipt of an unlawful commission or gift by a bank\nofficial. See l8 U.S.C. § 2l5 (unlawful for any bank employee to accept anything of value intended\nto be rewarded in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with business of bank).\n\n3. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Backdating of Transactions\n\nAs detailed in paragraphs 44-52 of the PSR, Parse’s conduct involved not only assisting in\nthe design, marketing, and implementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the\nimplementation of fraudulently backdated when Donna Guerin and others at J&G realized that the\nshelters had been implemented incorrectly, or not consistent with the clients’ wishes with respect to\n\n> Parse executed a $3,ooo,ooo short options deal through J&G. Using a conservative 3%\nfee results in a $9o,ooo opinion leter value. Parse only deducted just over $l.2 million of the\n$3,ooo,ooo in losses on his 2ooo return, and thus had available just under $l.8 million in losses to\nuse on future tax returns. Although Parse ultimately did not utilize those additional losses (because\nhe reversed his oun transaction when the IRS began investigating), the proper view of Parse’s oun\nfraudulent transaction should take into account the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo953l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009534.jpg": "Case penance emmeneas 6o83 ee acreage of ll7\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page lo of 4l\nconversations with David Parse, that the steps of the transactions had to be completed by the end of\nthe year to achieve the tax benefits. Given this clear legal imperative, Parse’s willingness to\n\nparticipate in such conduct can only be viewed as brazen misconduct.\n\nG. The Indictment, Trial, New Trial Rulings, and the PSR\n\nOn March 4, 2olo, the grand jury returned a third superseding Indictment charging Parse,\nGuerin, Daugerdas, Mayer, and Brubaker in thirty-one counts. Parse in particular was charged with\na conspiracy to the defraud the IRS, to commit tax evasion, and to commit mail and wire fraud\n(Count One), as well as three counts of tax evasion relating to the tax shelter transactions of three\nseparate tax shelter clients (Counts Seventeen, Eighteen, and Nineteen). Parse was also charged in\nCounts Twenty and Twenty-Five with engaging in a corrupt endeavor to obstruct and impede the IRS\nand mail fraud, respectively, essentially through the same conduct underlying the Count One\nconspiracy charge.\n\nOn February 28, 2oll, trial commenced against Parse and his co-defendants. On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels. As calculated by Probation, the final offense level is 4o, calling for a Sentencing Guidelines\nsentence at the statutory maximum, 23 years’ imprisonment. PSR 4 lo3.

The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request.

Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record.

Likewise\nincorporating the factual allegations of the conspiracy count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,\nalong with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching\nscheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the\nJenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.\n\nThe proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an investment representative at Deutsche Bank\nAlex Broun and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax\nfraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\nfinancial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010210.jpg": "Cabs i2o2 Ordo RESD AS Nr emnreet 6 S82 Fibs OS OOP PaR RH el2l Af afll7l 7\nA-6o8o\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 7 of 4l\n2. Parse’s Personal Tax Evasion\n\nParse executed his oun fraudulent SOS tax shelter transaction to eliminate the gains he\neared in 2ooo, and received a free fraudulent opinion leter from J&G. The losses Parse created —\n$3,ooo,ooo — were larger than Parse needed for the 2ooo year, suggesting that he intended to\neliminate taxes in more than one year. On his 2ooo tax return, Parse claimed a $l,278,7o6\nfraudulent loss, evading $5l7,542 in taxes on over $2.l million in income. See GX lool-l32 (Parse\n2ooo Tax Return); GX looo-52 (IRS Certificate of Assessment and Payments for Parse’s 2ooo\nTaxes); GX 54-l (J&G Opinion Leter for Parse). Parse's receipt of a free opinion leter, which\nwould have otherwise cost him no less than $9o,ooo (and likely more)’ had he paid the going rate\nfor a J&G opinion leter, violated Deutsche Bank's gift prohibition policy and almost certainly\nviolated the law, in that it constituted his receipt of an unlawful commission or gift by a bank\nofficial. See l8 U.S.C. § 2l5 (unlawful for any bank employee to accept anything of value intended\nto be rewarded in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with business of bank).\n\n3. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Backdating of Transactions\n\nAs detailed in paragraphs 44-52 of the PSR, Parse’s conduct involved not only assisting in\nthe design, marketing, and implementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the\nimplementation of fraudulently backdated when Donna Guerin and others at J&G realized that the\nshelters had been implemented incorrectly, or not consistent with the clients’ wishes with respect to\n\n> Parse executed a $3,ooo,ooo short options deal through J&G. Using a conservative 3%\nfee results in a $9o,ooo opinion leter value. Parse only deducted just over $l.2 million of the\n$3,ooo,ooo in losses on his 2ooo return, and thus had available just under $l.8 million in losses to\nuse on future tax returns. Although Parse ultimately did not utilize those additional losses (because\nhe reversed his oun transaction when the IRS began investigating), the proper view of Parse’s oun\nfraudulent transaction should take into account the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010213.jpg": "caeeaemeeeeeen meinen 6o83 PRAGA?\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page lo of 4l\nconversations with David Parse, that the steps of the transactions had to be completed by the end of\nthe year to achieve the tax benefits.

The Indictment, Trial, New Trial Rulings, and the PSR\n\nOn March 4, 2olo, the grand jury returned a third superseding Indictment charging Parse,\nGuerin, Daugerdas, Mayer, and Brubaker in thirty-one counts. Parse in particular was charged with\na conspiracy to the defraud the IRS, to commit tax evasion, and to commit mail and wire fraud\n(Count One), as well as three counts of tax evasion relating to the tax shelter transactions of three\nseparate tax shelter clients (Counts Seventeen, Eighteen, and Nineteen). Parse was also charged in\nCounts Twenty and Twenty-Five with engaging in a corrupt endeavor to obstruct and impede the IRS\nand mail fraud, respectively, essentially through the same conduct underlying the Count One\nconspiracy charge.\n\nOn February 28, 2oll, trial commenced against Parse and his co-defendants. On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels. As calculated by Probation, the final offense level is 4o, calling for a Sentencing Guidelines\nsentence at the statutory maximum, 23 years’ imprisonment. PSR 4 lo3.

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.7 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately.

These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer.

The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually\nall of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for\ntheir oun sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that\nbehavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 2l-l72l, 2o22\nWL l449l74, at *l-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2o22); United States v.

Feb. l, 2o22).\n\nIn sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any\ncrimes, for that mater—in the almost 2o-year period since the conduct at issue in this case\nended. There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. Maxwell is atracted to minors or has the sort of\nuncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was\nEpstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual\nabuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2ooos, Ms. Maxwell was involved\nin two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in\ntheir lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government\nconcedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that\nassertion in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence\nwhatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no\nrisk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply\n§ 4Bl.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.\n\nThe government asserts that § 4Bl.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits\nwithin the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at 6o. It is\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo434\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document662_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 29\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell ended their romantic relationship and “went their separate ways”: Ms.\nMaxwell “moved on” from Epstein, stopped coming into the office, started dating other men, and\neventually entered a long-term, commited relationship with Ted Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence\nwas Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 2o4).

The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government nevertheless atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010448.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page2of77\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this memorandum in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with sentencing, which is scheduled for June 28, 2o22.

There would be no trial for\nEpstein and no public vindication and justice for his accusers. The government nou had a huge\nhole to fill: Epstein’s empty chair.

Instead, the spotlight turned\nto Ghislaine Maxwell, with whom Epstein had had a relationship that was long since over and who\nwas not named in the Florida “sweetheart” deal.\n\nMs. Maxwell did not appear in the 2ol9 SDNY indictment against Epstein, nor was she\nthe subject of the 2oo7 SDFL grand jury presentation. Nevertheless, the government pivoted to\nMs. Maxwell, who up to that point had never been the focus of any criminal prosecution for these\nevents, and spent the next year investigating her. In doing so, SDNY had to reach back to events\nthat were over 2o years old, a decade before the conduct that was the subject of the SDFL\nprosecution and the 2ol9 Epstein indictment. Almost a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest,\nSDNY’s Acting U.S. Atorney put the timing of Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution and the extreme age\nof the charges against her in context:\n\nWe were working hard on this investigation this past year. It’s not easy to put\ntogether a case that goes back that far, but it was nothing other than we did the\ninvestigation and we were ready at this time to proceed.?\n\nThe entire focus of the accusations initially aimed at Epstein were nou centered on one\ndefendant alone — Ghislaine Maxwell — at a time when she was already being vilified in the press\nand the public domain. The media coverage was relentless and voluminous: dozens of broadcast\ndocumentaries, tens of streamed videos and podcasts, and publication of some 5o books and\nthousands of superficially writen articles. The tsunami of one-sided, overwhelmingly negative\ncoverage about Ms. Maxwell that folloued the arrest and death of Epstein presented Ms. Maxwell\nas a caricature of evil, a depiction that has inevitably shaped the public’s opinion of her.

The government has never argued, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail applications or otherwise, that Ms. Maxwell is a danger to the community; nor could they.\nApart from the conduct at issue in this case, which occurred almost 2o to 3o years ago, Ms.\nMaxwell has never once been accused of a crime, much less sexual abuse of minors. In fact, after\nleaving Epstein, Ms. Maxwell was involved in commited, long-term relationships with two men,\nboth of whom had young children who continue to support her. Ms. Maxwell is not a dangerous\ncriminal or a habitual offender. She is someone who wants nothing more than to live a normal\nfamily life — something she was denied because of her association with Epstein and will nou\nalmost certainly never have. The public does not need to be protected from Ms. Maxwell and such\nconsiderations should have no weight in determining her sentence.\nA Guidelines Sentence is Not Necessary to Achieve Specific or General Deterrence\n\nA guidelines sentence for Ms. Maxwell would not serve the sentencing goals of either\nspecific or general deterrence. A significant sentence is not necessary to achieve the goal of\nindividual deterrence here. This is Ms. Maxwell’s only brush with the law. Ms. Maxwell has\nalready learned a painful lesson from her arrest and prosecution, has lost her marriage and her\nstepchildren, and has been harshly punished during pre-sentence incarceration. Ms. Maxwell\nhas already shoun that she will not reoffend and does not need to be further deterred from\ncommiting crimes in the future.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010507.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 6l of 77\nvaughanedwards@ukgateway.net\n24\" April 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

As part of a disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified,\ngroomed, and abused multiple victims, while she enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury and\nprivilege. In her wake, Maxwell left her victims permanently scarred with emotional and\npsychological injuries. That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting\na just sentence for Maxwell’s crimes.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the sentencing\nof Maxwell in the above-captioned case, which is scheduled for June 28, 2o22, and in response to\nthe defendant’s June l5, 2o22 sentencing memorandum and objections to the Pre-Sentence\nInvestigation Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”).

The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of child sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe knou that although all adverse events that occur during\nchildhood can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes,\nwe knou that among those, child sexual abuse in particular increases\nrisk for a very, very high number of various health problems and\nmental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of\nthose problems.\n(Tr. 74l-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\n\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years\nof abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR § 38). Jane\ncontinues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: “It ruined my self-esteem, my\nself-worth,” and it “led me to not trust people.” (/d.). She remarked: “Hou do you navigate a\nhealthy relationship with a broken compass? I didn’t even understand what real love is supposed\nto look like.” (/d.). Jane’s pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her\ntestimony.\n\nIn a leter’ to the Court in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with sentencing, Annie explained: “One of the most\npainful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my\nperceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other\nvulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust themselves.” She further\n7 The victim impact statements referenced in this submission have been provided to defense\ncounsel in accordance with the Court’s June 2l, 2o22 Order (Dkt. No. 668). Subject to the process\noutlined in the Court’s Order, the statements will be publicly filed.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 42 of 55\nexplained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”\n\nKate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far\nreaching for me.” In a leter to the Court in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have\nstruggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic\natacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered lou self esteem, loss of career\nopportunities. I have batled greatly with feeling unable to trust my oun instincts, in choosing\nromantic relationships.”\n\nCarolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the\ndefendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug\naddiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction\nthroughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating\npsychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence\nis necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant\ninflicted upon her many victims.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page53oof55\n\nMoney is a key theme underlying the criminal conduct in this case. The defendant’s access\nto wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed\nshoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from\nstruggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled\nthe defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to transport victims and maintain the fabulous\nproperties where those victims were abused. That same wealth motivated the defendant to make\nsure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That\nwealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary privilege, and\nshe profited from her relationship with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small\nfinancial penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.\n\nThe defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is atempting\nto make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case. The defendant’s assets range in\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 6 of 68\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document673_ Filed o6/24/22 Page2of3\nvictims have a right to be heard in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights\nAct. See l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4).\n\nWith respect to all other victim impact statements, which were not solicited by the\nGovernment, the Government is not asking the Court to make any factual findings about these\nindividuals at sentencing or to consider these statements when weighing the factors under l8\nU.S.C. § 3553(a). Houever, in light of the Court’s “largely unlimited” discretion “as to the kind\nof information it may consider, or the source from which it may come,” United States v. Eberhard,\n525 F.3d l75, l77 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (cleaned up), the Court may accept these statements as part of\nthe record at sentencing. The Government defers to the Court as to whether and in what form it\nwishes to accept statements from these individuals.\n\nFinally, the Government opposes the redaction of any victim impact statements. The\ndefendant has not justified her redaction requests under the three-part test articulated in Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). To the extent there is a privacy interest\nat stake in these documents, it belongs to the victims, who are not seeking to file these leters under\nseal. The defendant gestures at a due process interest, but the decisionmaker at sentencing is the\nCourt, who will be able to review the redacted portions and evaluate them to the extent the Court\nthinks them useful. No due process interest is protected by withholding victim impact statements\nfrom the public.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo66l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page 2of2l\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.”). Two of Maxwell’s victims, Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, seek to assist\nthe Court in exercising this authority by providing oral VISs at sentencing. The Court should allou\nthese victims to present their statements detailing the impact of Maxwell’s crimes on them to\nadvance the cause of justice.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nAs the extensive evidence at trial has revealed, Maxwell was involved in a far-reaching long—\nrunning sex trafficking conspiracy. As the Court recently explained, Maxwell was found guilty after a\nlengthy jury trial of a “decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous\ncoconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and\nproved at trial, employed a single ‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes\na single conspiracy offense with multiple victims.” (Dkt. 657 at 2-3).\n\nNou, Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal involvement in this expansive conspiracy.\nThe victims clearly have a right to be heard as part of this process.\n\nBoth moving victims, Sarah and Elizabeth, came to New York as young women seeking to\nmatriculate at the Fashion Institute of Technology and then work in the fashion industry. Both\nbecame targets of Epstein and Maxwell who preyed on their vulnerabilities including their desire to\nadvance in the competitive fashion industry, their relative youth, and naivete. Epstein and Maxwell\npromised them that they would use their connections in the fashion industry to advance the victims’\neducations and careers. But there was a cruel catch. For every favor or promise of a favor, sexual\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo693\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagel7 of 2l\nJudge Hull observed, “[ml]ysteries remain about hou Epstein escaped federal prosecution....” /n re\nWild, 994 F.3d at l327 (llth Cir. en banc 2o2l) (Hull, J., dissenting).\n\n‘These “mysteries” about this controversial non—prosecution deal have led to skepticism from\nall quarters.

That was both\ntherapeutic and traumatizing. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four-brave victim-\nwitnesses, whose experiences paralleled my oun, to knou that I was not alone and that our story\nwas finally being told for the world to hear. But it was also traumatizing to relive the experience, and\nflashbacks and the nightmares have increased.\n\nIam grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict. But a question\nstill tears at my soul — After all of this, hou can the manager of this enormous sex trafficking\nconspiracy involving so many co-conspirators that snared loo's if not l,ooos of vulnerable girls and\nyoung women over three decades continue to maintain her innocence? Who and what institution\nenabled this sex trafficking ring to continue. Why haven’t the institutions and important people that\nenabled them been exposed and brought to justice? Reflecting on it, I knou the answers to my\nquestions.\n\nMaxwell is today the same woman I met almost 2o years ago — incapable of compassion or\ncommon human decency. Because of her wealth, social status, and connections, she believes herself\nbeyond reproach and above the law. Sentencing her to the rest of her life in prison will not change\nher, but it will give other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and help us as we\n\ncontinue to work to recover from the sex-traticking hell she perpetrated. She will never,\never hurt another young woman or child in this lifetime. For that, I am sure.\n\nAs for the important, high-profile enablers — governmental institutions, politicians, and very\nwealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad — so far their stature and pouer have protected\nthem. I hope that one day they will be exposed, and we will be able to say that the United States\ntruly is governed by the rule of law and not by pouerful people.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68o Filed o6/26/22 Pagelof3\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nJune 26, 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the Giuffre unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case.

In this case, Government\nwitnesses testified about their association with the defendant and Epstein in their true names,\nregardless of any feelings they may have had about their testimony. Those witnesses face the same\ngeneralized risks of harassment and negative implications of association with this case in the public\neye as any defense witnesses. More broadly, this is hardly the first high-profile trial in this District,\nor this country, yet the defendant has identified no analogous circumstance in which the\ngeneralized concerns identified by the defendant justified the kind of anonymity order the\ndefendant seeks.

Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for identification as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none identified with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva Dubin. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva Dubin] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember DUBIN being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If Dubin, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 72l Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Court explained that “Anton’s borrouing from his clients, while ethically\nquestionable, is . . . irrelevant to his truthfulness as an expert.” Jd. at l464.l\n\nThe same logic applies here. At most, Mr. JJ engaged in unethical (but not\nuntruthful) conduct that created the risk of harm by others. But none of that conduct involved\nlying or deceit, and none of it is relevant to his truthfulness.\n\nThere are other reasons this Court should preclude the government’s cross-examination.\nFirst, the Court should consider “whether the testimony of the witness in question is crucial or\nunimportant.” Nelson, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 39o. Here, Mr. J testimony relevant only\nto a narrou and limited issue—the admissibility of a document whose authenticity and relevance\nthe government appears not to question.\n\nSecond, the Court should consider “the relationship between the subject mater of the\nprior deceptive act and that of the instant litigation.

Phe subject mater of the instant litigation, by contrast, is alleged sexual abuse and\ntrafficking allegedly commited decades ago. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between “subject mater of\nthe prior [allegedly] deceptive act and that of the instant litigation.” See id.\n\nCases permiting cross-examination about an atorney’s disbarment or suspension are not\nto the contrary.

Donziger, 2o2l WL l865376, at *4.\nUnder Nixon, the subpoena must “clear three hurdles: (l) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3)\nspecificity.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Here, Maxwell’s subpoena fails, at a minimum, to clear the\nadmissibility hurdle, because Rule 4o8 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely,\ninadmissible.\n\nUnder Rule 4o8(a), evidence of accepting a valuable consideration to compromise a\nclaim, as well as statements or conduct made in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with negotiations about the claim, are\n“not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a\ndisputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed.

To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the child, that puts the child at risk\nl4 for being abused by others.

Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk.

So these are vulnerabilities that have\n3 been found to be specific to child sexual abuse risk.\n\n4 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.\n\n5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"atachment\"?\n\n6 A. I am.\n\n7 Q. What is atachment?\n\n8 A. Atachment really refers to the relationship and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\n9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at\nlo the caregiver atachment, so typically the relationship that it\nll develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since\n\nl2 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and\nl3 children, as well as adults.\n\nl4 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\n\nl5 atachment and grooming.\n\nl6 A. So in the context of building a relationship of trust and\nl7 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate\n\nl8 the child, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying\nl9 to create increased dependency, trust, and atachment. They\n2o hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the child,\n2l and the child feels often very special, and that there's\n22 something unique and important and valuable about their\n23 relationship with the perpetrator.\n24 Q.

Very common.\n\n9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, if an\n\nlo individual was sexually abused as a child, who, if anyone, is\nll that individual most likely to disclose the sexual abuse to?\n\nl2 A. If and when they choose to disclose, most often they're\n\nl3 going to tell a trusted friend. If we're talking about\n\nl4 adolescents, they're going to talk to a peer. If we are\n\nl5 talking about adults, a trusted friend.

This evidence\n3 is probative of that question. In particular, the fact that\n\n4 schoolgirl costumes, small ones, were found in the same floor\n\n5 of the house as a massage room where an underage girl was\n\n6 sexually abused is certainly probative.\n\n7 THE COURT: It seems to me that that evidence, as you\n8 alluded, Mr. Everdell, so I have my denial of the exclusion of\n9 witness 3.

What is that term?\n\n2 A. Atachment basically refers to the relationship between one\n3 person, one individual and another. The original research was\n4 conducted looking at the atachment as a <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between an\n5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded\n\n6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either\n\n7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for\n\n8 example, two intimate partners as adults.\n\n9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\nlo atachment and grooming?\n\nll A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are\n\nl2 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that\n\nl3 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the\nl4 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or\nl5 atachment and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> between the perpetrator and the\n\nl6 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the\nl7 perpetrator.\n\nl8 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you\n\nl9 familiar with the term coercive control?\n2o A. Iam.\n2l Q. What is coercive control?\nae A. Coercive control refers to a strategic patern of behavior\n23 that's designed to atain and maintain control ina\n24 relationship. So coercion means geting somebody to either do\n25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool49o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 36oofl58 36\nLBAGma x2 Rocchio - Direct\n\nl what that typically entails, not just the sexual components,\n\n2 but also the psychological and emotional components and their\n\n3 effects.

In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who have reported being groomed in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\n\n9 sexual abuse?\n\nlo A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I\nll said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been\nl2 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a\nl3 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to\nl4 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to\n\nl5 knou, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and\nl6 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the\nl7 definition of grooming.\n\nl8 Q. Approximately hou many patients have you treated, evaluated\nl9 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?\n2o A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated\n2l who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be\n22 hundreds upon hundreds.\n23 Q.

Epstein, l9-cr-49o (RMB) and U.S. v.\nMaxwell, 2o-cr-33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,\n\nWe write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from\nthe Department of Justice on July 25, 2o25, advising that the Court is seeking leters on behalf of\nvictims seting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!\n\nBy the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s actions. To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n'Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.\n\n* Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page lo of 27\nBSF\nA. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page 24 of 27\n|\nThe government has plainly not met its burden to justify an unsealing in this case.

Times Co., 828 F.2d llo, ll6 (2d Cir. l987))); Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (directing courts\nassessing requests to unseal grand jury materials to pay particular atention to the request’s\ntiming, given that the passage of time may weigh in favor of disclosure of grand jury materials\nbecause it inevitably “brings about the death” of all parties involved).\nL The grand jury materials in this case should remain sealed\nThere is a long history of maintaming the secrecy of grand jury proceedings for a reason.\nThe purposes of the secrecy include ensuring the freedom of grand juries in their deliberations\nand “to protect [the] mnocent accused ....” Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. at 68l n.6. Beyond\nprotecting innocent parties who are the subject of grand jury investigations, this secrecy also\nserves to protect witnesses and other innocent nonparties who may be mentioned in grand jury\nproceedings from any unwarranted association with the crimes alleged therein. Because of the\npolicy and due process rationale behind grand jury secrecy, the permissible bases upon which\ngrand jury materials may be shared are limited to certain exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3). The Second\nCircuit has recognized limited additional “special circumstances” in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate, including historical interest by the public. Craig, l3l F.3d at lo2. But in\n? The Southern District of Florida recently declined to unseal the grand jury materials pertaining to the government’s /\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein, which we understand concems the same or substantially similar facts. Due to a\nCircuit split, the Southern District of Florida evaluated only the exceptions to grand jury secrecy enumerated in Rule\n6(e). Order Den.

As there are parties whose names appear in the grand jury\nexhibits but did not appear in the grand jury transcripts, the Government is undertaking to notify\nsuch parties to the extent their names appear in grand jury exhibits that were not publicly admited\nat the Maxwell trial (and they were not already notified in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the request to unseal\nthe grand jury transcripts). The Government respectfully requests to update the Court follouing\nthose notifications by August l4, 2o25, and requests that the Court await that update before\nunsealing any of the grand jury exhibits, to the extent the Court is otherwise inclined to do so.\n\nIn conjunction with this leter, the Government will submit sealed, ex parte submissions\nclarifying which portions of the grand jury exhibits in the Maxwell and Epstein maters have been\nmade public. In making this assessment, the Government has compared the grand jury exhibits\nagainst the trial record and exhibits in the Maxwell trial, as well as against any publicly filed civil\ncomplaints identified by the Government that were filed by certain victims, as explained in further\ndetail in the Government’s sealed, ex parte submissions. !\n\n' Many civil complaints were filed in federal and state courts on behalf of victims identified solely\n\nas “Jane Doe” or by initials that may or may not be the initials of the plaintiffs in those actions,\n\nand therefore the Government cannot atribute with certainty to whom the statements or allegations\n\nin those anonymized complaints can be atributed. If the Government identifies additional\n\nmaterials on public dockets that make such atribution possible, it promptly will notify the Court.\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l2 of 3l\nId.

And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain circumstances, put a child at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk.

Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.\n\n5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"atachment\"?\n\n6 A. I am.\n\n7 Q. What is atachment?\n\n8 A. Atachment really refers to the relationship and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\n9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at\nlo the caregiver atachment, so typically the relationship that it\nll develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since\n\nl2 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and\nl3 children, as well as adults.\n\nl4 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between\n\nl5 atachment and grooming.\n\nl6 A. So in the context of building a relationship of trust and\nl7 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate\n\nl8 the child, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying\nl9 to create increased dependency, trust, and atachment. They\n2o hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the child,\n2l and the child feels often very special, and that there's\n22 something unique and important and valuable about their\n23 relationship with the perpetrator.\n24 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n25 training, are you familiar with the term \"coercive control\"?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool793o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 63 of 228 739\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A.

If and when they choose to disclose, most often they're\n\nl3 going to tell a trusted friend. If we're talking about\n\nl4 adolescents, they're going to talk to a peer.

No. Unfortunately, we knou that rape, sexual assault,\n22 childhood sexual abuse, again, they are the most underreported\n23 crimes.

In particular, the fact that\n\n4 schoolgirl costumes, small ones, were found in the same floor\n\n5 of the house as a massage room where an underage girl was\n\n6 sexually abused is certainly probative.\n\n7 THE COURT: It seems to me that that evidence, as you\n8 alluded, Mr. Everdell, so I have my denial of the exclusion of\n9 witness 3.

Kahn, & Ghislaine Maxwell,\nl9-lo475-LGS-DCF\nDear Judge Freeman:\n\nPursuant to Individual Rule I.D, Plaintiff Annie Farmer hereby responds to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s request for a pre-motion conference in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with her anticipated\nmotion to stay discovery in this mater. The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion\nconference and deny her anticipated motion in its entirety because, as explained belou, each of\nMaxwell’s reasons for staying discovery is meritless and the motion is simply another atempt to\nunjustifiably delay this litigation.\n\nFirst, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of discovery.\n“TA] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been\ncharacterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis Vuiton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d\n83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). In this Circuit, courts balance the\nfollouing six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal\nproceedings:\n\nl) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented\n\nin the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have\n\nbeen indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously\n\nweighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private\n\ninterests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the\n\npublic interest.\n\nId. at 99. And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending\na criminal investigation: “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a\ncivil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a\nstay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.” In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig.,\nl33 F.R.D. l2, l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. l99o) (emphasis added) (internal citations omited). The Court\nshould deny Maxwell’s motion for a stay without prejudice to her ability to renew her application\nif she is arrested. Until that happens, houever, there are no grounds for a stay.\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019347.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Paged of 24\nGovernment, in filings Maxwell intended to submit in separate civil litigation.\n(District Court Docket Entry 52).

THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST FOR INTERVENTION\nThe Government is not a party to this civil action against Maxwell, and therefore does not\nhave standing to move for a stay of this action. Thus, for the limited purpose of seeking a stay,\nthe Government has sought leave to intervene in the action. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at l.) This\nCourt finds it unnecessary, houever, to deal with the Government’s leter in an “intervention”\nframework, which would require an inquiry as to whether the Government meets the standards\nset out in Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, given that a motion for a stay\nhas already been made by Maxwell, this Court finds it appropriate, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with that\nmotion and in the exercise of its discretion, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an\namicus curiae. See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 288 (2olo)\n(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative to\nintervention.”); Washington State Inv. Bd. v.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nApp.o6o\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019520.jpg": "Odsedl ADA SBos ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 628/PAg Kayei6l 257\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019551.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos ATT (hdc WARE 262 F i688 /Pageageisi ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v.

Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019557.jpg": "Cane PAGO oOBBoAIeht DOCORBAZDZ o FuEd D87o l 28g haga HS\nHonorable Alison J.

Op.Br. 26-33.\n\nIn addition to the reasons identified above, This Brief, supra at 7-lo, Judge\nPreska simply never had before her the full picture when deciding whether to\nunseal the deposition material. So Judge Preska never considered the government’s\nposition that the sealed material should not be released because it might prejudice\nthe ongoing investigation. Nor did she consider Judge Nathan’s view, embodied in\nmodification of the criminal protective order is fully consistent with that purpose,\nbecause she seeks only: (l) to share relevant information with Judge Preska; (2)\nunder seal; (3) iS ; and (4) to facilitate Judge\nPreska in performing a non-merits task assigned to her by this Court.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019865.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8ooGRoHAEN ISdtuUMEHt/2o FilesOOAH2o2 P a hag e 226/olo\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nRR anna\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n-V.- : 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. ;\npone ene nnn eee ee ee eX\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM\nIN SUPPORT OF DETENTION\n\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine\nMaxwell, the defendant, poses an extreme risk of flight; that she will not be able to rebut the\nstatutory presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E); and that the Court should\ntherefore order her detained.\n\nThe charges in this case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine\nMaxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial sexual predator, exploited and abused young\ngirls for years. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019867.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN ISdtuM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P a hag e426ioLo\nthe defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including\noffers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as l4 years old when\nthey were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims\nwere minors.\n\nThe Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In\n2ol6, the defendant gave deposition testimony in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit in the Southern\nDistrict of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019872.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DacOMENl 2o 2Fil Go OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgecd 26o.o\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

While we greatly appreciate\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

(Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019900.jpg": "Cas 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DstamtehPl &Pitdd BPP POM Page 26 St 2o\n\nMs. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal\ncircumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond.

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly.

In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts.

Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’).

The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant.

I want to address the notion that\n\n3 the defendant would have surrendered if the government had\n\n4 asked her to. As defense counsel conceded, no offer along\n\n5 those lines was ever made. And of course the government\n\n6 doesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation\n\n7 that their client would surrender.\n\n8 In fact, the fact that the government took these\n\n9 measures to arrest the defendant reflects hou seriously the\n\nlo government takes the risk of the defendant of flight. Why on\nll earth would the government notify the defendant through her\n\nl2 counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if the\nl3 government had serious concerns that she was a risk of flight?\nl4 That is exactly what occurred here.\n\nl5 In addition, it is interesting that defense counsel\n\nl6 notes that it should have been obvious to the government that\nl7 the defendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in\nl8 Civil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined to\nl9 accept service on behalf of plaintiffs who were seeking to sue\n2o the defendant in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with some of these allegations, and\nal they were required to seek leave of the court to serve the\n22 defendant through their counsel.\n23 Your Honor, turning to the question of the defendant's\n24 finances there is still at this point no substantive response\n25 regarding defendant's finances or about the lack of candor to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9994\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019996.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel37 of 2oo 74\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl detention was appropriate in that case on risk of flight alone.\n2 And, again, that conduct was -- at that point significant time\n3 had passed, and Jeffrey Epstein was not a foreign citizen.\n\n4 I want to respond with respect to the NPA.

See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020138.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehRa3o/PtagPagefliss 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020141.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehBaSo/Ptag Page fLaosf 22\nUnited States v.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\nemployment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020180.jpg": "CaSast: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020182.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQ)C3GouAUNt Besutrent! l7o2 lF ib 83228/2 49 Piageoid Ob l8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence.

The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring strains credulity.

The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

(Ex. I). After considering multiple writen\nsubmissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request in another writen\nopinion. (Ex. L).\n\n24. Judge Nathan concluded that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7).\n\n25. Judge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s argument that the strength of\nthe evidence was diminished by Maxwell’s pending pre-trial motions. (/d. at 5-6).\nShe also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by Maxwell, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\n[foreign citizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed\nmonitorship, Maxwell “would continue to have access to substantial assets—\ncertainly enough to enable her flight and to evade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). Judge\nNathan concluded, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020252.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel8 of 25\ninternational ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections\nabroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value, lack of candor\nabout her finances, and “extraordinary capacity to evade detection.” (Ex. D at 79-\n9l; Ex. H at 7-2o; Ex. L at 6-ll). Maxwell does not come close to identifying clear\nerror.\n\n34. Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for discovery. Often the opposing parties simply describe\nto the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce it.”\nId.; see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, l49 F.\nApp’x 4o, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2oo5); United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9, 32l n.7\n(2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Vondete, 5 F.

Ms. Maxwell is not suggesting that “any defendant in a case\nwith voluminous discovery must be released on bail to prepare for trial.”\nResp.94o. Her case and situation is unique. Other defendants may pose\na danger to the community. The Government concedes that she does not.\nOther defendants may not be U.S. citizens. Sheis. Other defendants may\nnot have strong U.S. connections. Ms. Maxwell has lived here for 3o\nyears, has a husband and step-children here, and has two sisters who are\nU.S. citizens and live here. Other defendants may not have pledged almost\nall of their assets or offer to have a monitor track her expenses. Ms.\nMaxwell has. Other defendants may not be willing to renounce their\nforeign citizenship. She is. Other defendants may have prior convictions.\nShe does not. But other defendants have no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to Jeffrey Epstein,\nand she does. Although unstated, that old <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> is the driving factor\nfor detention, and that is error.\n\n8. The Government says that the district judge has “closely\nmonitored” her conditions of confinement. Unfortunately, that is not\naccurate. The District Court accepted, without any real inquiry, the\nself-serving Government leters. These leters describe a “prison\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020364.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page6 of 24\nthings, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections\nabroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020365.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page? of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at l-2). Among other things,\nJudge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of\nthe Government’s proffer of evidence. (/d. at lo). Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6). Additionally, Judge Nathan was\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020366.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o). In particular, Maxwell did not “meaningfully\ndispute” that she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center (“MDC”) to review discovery and as much, if not more, time to\ncommunicate with her lawyers. (/d.).\n\nl4. Third, on February 23, 2o2l, Maxwell filed yet another bail\napplication, proposing two additional bail conditions. (Ex. I). After considering\nmultiple writen submissions (Ex. I, J, K), Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s request\nin another writen opinion (Ex. L). Judge Nathan reiterated that detention was\nwarranted in light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case,\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad,\nsubstantial financial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s\n“lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 7). Judge\nNathan noted, “If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her release.\nYet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\nl5. Throughout the pendency of this case, Judge Nathan has closely\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020367.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page9 of 24\nmonitored Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the\nGovernment to submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A\n(compiling update leters and relevant court orders)), and by reviewing and\naddressing defense motions regarding Maxwell’s conditions of confinement (see,\ne.g., id. at lo-ll).\n\nl6. Maxwell appealed Judge Nathan’s later two bail decisions. In\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with that appeal, Maxwell also moved for pretrial release pending appeal.\nAfter receiving briefing and hearing oral argument, this Court affirmed Judge\nNathan’s bail decisions and denied Maxwell’s motion for pretrial release on April\n27, 2o2l. (Mot. Ex. A). Responding to claims about Maxwell’s sleeping\nconditions that had been raised in her briefing and at oral argument, this Court’s\norder noted that any request for “relief specific to [Maxwell’s] sleeping conditions”\nat the MDC “should be addressed to the District Court.” (/d.).\n\nl7. At no point after this Court’s bail decision did Maxwell file a\nrenewed motion for pretrial release in the District Court.\n\nl8. Follouing the issuance of this Court’s decision, on April 29,\n2o2l, Maxwell submited a leter to Judge Nathan asking the District Court “to\naddress Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing the MDC to cease l5-\nminute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or justify the need for the disruptive\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page29 of 9l\nremaining reply briefs on ECF by April 2o, 2o2l.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery.

Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The victim would then\nbe escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the\n| victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN,\nwho would himself typically be naked. During these encounters,\nEPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical\ncontact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and\nindirect contact with the victim’s genitals.

In <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with each sexual encounter,\nEpstein or one of his employees or associates, including, at\ntimes, MAXWELL, paid the victim in cash.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell\nwith facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around\nl994 to l997. The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The $l superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two\ncounts of perjury in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to\nbegin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding\nindictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those\nmotions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking\ncount and another related conspiracy count.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than\nthose seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and\nthis Opinion, deal exclusively with the $l superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020788.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7o of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is m the custody ofa civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020814.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel96 of 2o8\ncase focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be\nclear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI.

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.3 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\nNevertheless, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021222.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EAS 3536o38, Page5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “‘will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding recommendation for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021271.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia concluded her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing... , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’|s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command .. . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges]... , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nHu According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nHS Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021306.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel34 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcern,” including the follouing:\n\n“Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; l\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. ‘©\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office .. . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\nl6s In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3.

The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021331.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ET 3536o38, Pagel59 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v.

Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n7o4 OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°?

Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span>\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021427.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 353 3536o38, Page255 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 253 of 348\nprosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the\nplea was entered on June 3o, 2oo8.\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nFrom my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it\n\nwas an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You\n\nknou, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal\n\nprocess],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a\n\nfederal indictment and a federal trial. So to me, saying to a victim\n\nthe case is nou back under investigation is perfectly accurate.\n\n4, February — March 2oo8: Villafaia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare\nfor a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Atorneys for\nVictims, and Cautions about Continued Delay\n\nIn February 2oo8, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental\nmemorandum. Villafafia removed some victims knoun to Epstein from the PBPD investigation\nand others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly\ndiscovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.\n\nWhile the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of\nthe Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and\natempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some\nvictims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the state criminal case.\nVillafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service\norganization” to provide atorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some\nvictims to provide contact information for the atorneys.*4! During this period, an atorney from\nthe victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.\nVillafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit\nsuicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress\nenough hou important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’\nanswer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the atack while we are\nforced to wait on the sidelines.”\n\n5. March — April 2oo8: Villafaia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal\nCharges\n\nVillafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing\nothers who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital\n34 The FBI Victim Specialist informed Villafafia that she spoke “directly to seven victims” and informed them\nof the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime\nare afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”\n\n227\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021437.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA D6l 3536o39, Page7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.>\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\nJudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.*°* Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.°® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXII. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafaia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n3o3 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\nae Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\nidentified in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021443.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 567 3536o39, Pagel3 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo -— 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”38! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings. 3°”\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “‘conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nice See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 7 G.2, available at htps://www-justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag_guidelines2ol2. pdf.

FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nAs previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the practice\nof law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 4l So. 3d at l72.\n\n253\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021465.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page35 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 289 of 348\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\ninvestigative steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing investigative activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the Florida criminal case.*\"\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°3\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and... result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s...\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”*** Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\nBas As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\nBA When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021478.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page48 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement|,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021500.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page/o of 2l7\nSA-324\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing procedure;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

In <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell.

Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with hou Epstein died.

For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in <span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\n<span class=\"highlight\">connection</span> with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges.

Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide.

In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell.

He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time\nincluding a high profile case with extensive media atention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court\nproceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this\nwriter that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.\nDespite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly\ndenied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his\natorney, to take a shouer, and to brush his teeth. He was eating his cereal when this writer arrived and said \"| have my paper\nspoon here.\" He reported he is going to have a bail hearing on Monday and believes he is going to be released from jail.\nInmate Epstein reported he is a Banker and has a \"big business” in the community and that \"being alive is fun.\" He also\nrevealed he enjoys learning and teaching. He has confidence in his atorney and described him as \"competent.\" Inmate\nEpstein denied any mental health history or history of suicidality. He also reported none of his family members have mental\nhealth histories. Inmate Epstein stated he is a mathematician and took post graduate classes in this area of study. Inmate\nEpstein stated he has a support system in the community, including friends and other associates.

Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly\nmade Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no\nfootman: he loved luxury and, in his oun words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who\ncould shou the rich hou to live with their money. “I want people to understand the pouer, the\nresponsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his pouers seemed magical. “I\nthink it’s all done with mirrors,” says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and\nlost) when an oil deal didn’t work out.\nNext: Epstein's Icarus moment.\na iS, EAS we Be) ee\npad... es, oy ek A ee ae\nBo RT Ae\nfm Fae 2 ee in:\na4 fo fey ok ‘Gyan ss ty a Wal\n. * ae a Bp 2 se\n* WE eee alsa 5 + id «pS — — _ r Pe \"\nThe New York Times\nRedux)\nStroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. “Everybody who’s his friend thinks he’s so\ndarn brilliant because he’s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, | never saw him work. Anybody |\nknou that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.”\nThose who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind\ngoes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from\nmathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also\nto identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ...

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\nhtn-/ww_orinthi s.clickahilitv eomivalent antennae Pena That Pantaciee de Reco Request Noy A aeRRe\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031420.jpg": "Ne\nDate: 9/ol/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: lo\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n\nl-o3-ool498 (Continued)\nat which time she did not talk to him per instructions by her\ndivorce atorney.

This guy plays 26 hours a day.”\nThose who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind\ngoes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from\nmathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time, That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgar and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\n4 Yentord = |\nhtn:/hanans meinthic clickahility eam/nt/ent?action=ent&tle=ThetFantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 28 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032074.jpg": "RO eee\na being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.” media.
